1,"The objective of the Hazardous Substance Research Center/South and Southwest HSRC/S&amp;SW) is to provide basic and applied research, technology transfer and community outreach that address hazardous substance problems, especially the engineering management of contaminated sediments and other problems of special interest to communities within EPA Regions 4 and 6. Due to past and present toxic releases, these regions face serious hazardous substance problems and yet contain a significant fraction of the wetlands and inland waters found in the United States. The mission of the Center is to be a primary provider of the tools and process knowledge required to respond to the hazardous substance problems posing the greatest risks to people and the environment. The Center consists of Louisiana State University, as lead institution, Georgia Institute of Technology, Rice University, Texas A&amp;M University. The broad range of expertise available to the research and outreach teams insure the ability of the Center to be truly community and problem-driven.The Center was initially directed by Dr. Danny Reible, currently the Bettie Margaret Smith Chair of Environmental Health Engineering at the University of Texas. In 2004, he was joined by Dr. John Pardue, the Elizabeth Howell Stewart Professor of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering at Louisiana State University, as co-Director. The research themes of the Center include 1) assessing the physical, chemical and biological availability of contaminants in sediments, 2) evaluating and enhancing biotransformation processes in sediments, and, 3) improving the science of risk management for contaminated sediments. The overriding objective is to improve the effectiveness of remedial approaches by seeking to understand and minimize contaminant release and exposure. Four broad research topics are under evaluation. These projects seek to 1) evaluate the bioavailability of desorption resistant contaminants, 2) develop improved approaches for in-situ containment and treatment, 3) assess contaminant losses during removal and episodic storm events, and, 4) evaluate phytoremediation for remediation in wetlands and confined disposal facilities (CDFs). During the period of Center operation, significant progress was made in each of these research areas.

2,"I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In Phase I of the greenhouse study, column experiments were accomplished in June 2005. Two types of soils were selected based on the physico-chemical properties, which were most likely to influence As retention. Pesticides (sodium arsenate and DMA) were used at two different rates (675 and 1500 mg kg-1) representing superfund conditions. Rice (used as the test crop) was grown for a period of 6 months. Rice was harvested twice, after 3 and 6 months. Soils were collected at different time periods: immediately after spiking (time-0), after 6 months (time-final) and after 1 and 3 years. The second set of column experiments was started in late June 2004. It involved two soils (Immokalee and Orelia), and two pesticides (Sodium arsenate and DMA) added at a rate of 1500 mg kg-1 of soil. Both soils were amended with Al-WTR and Fe-WTR at two rates (5% and 10%) expected to be effective in reducing soluble As. Rice was used as the test crop. To better understand the effect of soil-aging on As bioaccessibility and speciation, columns from both of the experimental set ups were retained (without the cultivar) for three years and were sampled once in a year. The columns were maintained at optimum soil moisture conditions (&ldquo;pot-holding capacity&rdquo;). Aqueous speciation study of As was also conducted to see whether there were changes in the oxidation state of As. Soil samples collected at different time periods were extracted for soil-As forms by a sequential extraction technique and for bioavailable As by in-vitro gastrointestinal method as described by Datta and Sarkar (2004). In all the three soils except for Pahokee Muck, most of the total extractable As was in the soluble form. Soluble form decreased significantly after 1 year of soil-pesticide equilibration. Arsenic bioaccessibility also decreased with time in all the four soils, indicating the affect of ageing as well as soil properties on bioaccessibility. Selected in-vivo study using As-contaminated soils were conducted on male/female BALB/c mice. In-vivo bioavailability was calculated from the blood collected by cardiac puncture at different time periods. Results obtained with WTRs suggests that significantly higher levels of the added As was transformed into bound forms, thus decreasing its bioaccessibility in Fe-WTR and Al-WTR amended soils. Arsenic bioaccessibility decreased immediately after spiking for both the WTRs, with more reduction at higher application rate (10%). Geochemical speciation after 1 year of soil-WTR-pesticide equilibration showed that As in the WTR amended soils was mostly in Fe-and Al-bound form, therefore less available, thereby decreasing As bioaccessibility.

3,"Objective(s): Develop the necessary range of knowledge and technologies to use plants to produce chemical feedstocks and fuels with more renewable and more enviromentally acceptable methods than current sources such as petrochemicals. Focus initially on the cereal crops (especially wheat and rice) and other grasses and non-grass species with potential for biofuel development. Coordinate with other ARS and non-ARS projects in specific approaches to biofuel research and development.Approach:To achieve these objectives, an integrated plant molecular, genomics, bioinformatics, plant transformation approach will be developed for the production of biofuels from crops. Specifically: 1) Determine parameters underlying ectopic expression of polysaccharides and proteins in plant leaf and stem tissue, to include stability of expressed products and plant response; 2) Determine potential for altering plant architecture and cell wall structure for altered functions such as more efficient light gathering, storage capacity, and increased efficiency of post-harvest product processing as for straw/fiber conversion; 3) Modify polysaccharide production to enhance ethanol production, to include both existing and novel polymer structures; 4) Develop a repertoire of tissue and development specific promoters, initially concentrating on promoters efficient in the monocotyledonous plants.

4,"The overall objective of this collaborative project is to metabolically engineer the E. coli sugar-utilization regulatory systems (SURS) to utilize sugar mixtures obtained from plant biomass. We will introduce specific genetic modifications to the SURS and analyze the consequences of these changes at the cellular level. The specific goals are to: (1) construct E. coli strains with modified SURS and evaluate their capability to efficiently utilize sugar mixtures (glucose, xylose and arabinose); (2) evaluate changes in the regulation of gene expression at the genomic scale resulting from engineering E. coli SURS; (3) identify functional metabolic pathways and quantify their fluxes in SURS mutants and wild type strains by using a novel flux analysis technique based on bondomer analysis of 2D NMR bond-labeling experiments; (4) integrate these results using a novel genetic network-based MFA model that combines gene expression and metabolic flux data; and (5) propose further genetic/environmental modification for improving the capacity of SURS mutants for fermenting sugar mixtures.The specific aims of this project are: 1) to develop an integrated quantitative model that captures existing mechanistic knowledge about SURS from literature and exiting data; and 2) to refine the model with in-house experiments from Dr. Gonzalez&rsquo;s group at Rice University.

5,"In only 12 years &mdash; from  1987 to 1999 &mdash; the world&rsquo;s population increased by 20 percent,  from 5 to 6 billion. This growth, combined with dramatic increases in per capita  resource consumption, contributes to increasingly serious social and environmental  problems. These problems will only worsen over the next 50 years as the projected  world population nears 9 billion and developing nations become more industrialized. The overall purpose of Phase I of this design project was to investigate the  feasibility of substituting natural pozzolans for Portland cement in the construction  of engineering infrastructure in the developing world. The evaluation criteria  used in this Phase 1 study included: workability, strength, availability, economic,  societal concerns, and environmental impact. In particular &ldquo;high tech&rdquo; solutions  which are not sustainable on a long-term basis in most of the developing world  were forgone, and instead students learned to apply &ldquo;appropriate technology&rdquo; &mdash; defined  as  the use of  materials and technology that are culturally,  economically, and socially suitable to the area in which they are implemented.            The use of a natural pozzolans for hydraulic cement began in            prehistoric times, and was abandoned for western-based Portland cement            concrete technology in the early 1900&rsquo;s. In recent years incorporation            of natural pozzolans into engineering materials has been largely            supplanted by pozzolans derived from industrial byproducts such as fly ash produced  from the burning of pulverized coal, silica fume produced from electric arc  furnaces, and ground blast furnace slag. However, in developing countries, especially those with active or historic  volcanism and/or large scale rice production, there are potential large supplies  of suitable natural pozzolans. In addition, locally available (and thus cost  effective) natural pozzolans may substantially reduce the overall use of Portland  cement if simple and reliable field methods can be developed that would judge  their suitability for use in concrete. United Nations Millennium Development Goal Number 1 is to &ldquo;eradicate  extreme poverty and hunger.&rdquo; Since more than a billion people still live  on less than US$1 a day, there is a need for low cost and a locally available  substitutes for Portland cement. Natural pozzolans will most likely he free  to local communities, like sand and gravel currently are. Therefore, if a community  obtains materials locally, their labor can usually be considered as an in-kind  cost to the project&rsquo;s sponsors. Millennium Development Goal Number 7  is to &ldquo;ensure environmental sustainability&rdquo; with a target for year  2015 to reduce by half the proportion of people without access to safe drinking  water. Water supply projects are one aspect of engineering infrastructure where  natural pozzolans might be used. Three natural pozzolans were evaluated in our Phase I study; volcanic ash,diatomaceous earth, and rice husk ash. A life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic input-output LCA were performed  to further determine the environmental impact of manufacturing 1 ton of Portland  cement.   Laboratory tests were performed on different pozzolan-cement mixes to  determine issues related to workability and strength.   An economic and social analysis, focused on the Philippines, was performed  to support Phase II plans to construct prototype water storage tanks that contain  some percent of natural pozzolan substitution.

7,"Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) contamination in groundwater and surface      water in the United States is widespread and considered a major threat      to drinking water resources. The fuel oxygenate is therefore being phase      out,      and ethanol is the leading oxygenate to replace MTBE. To prevent a repeat      of the problems associated with MTBE, the potential impacts to groundwater      quality resulting from the inevitable releases of ethanol-blended gasoline      must be understood. Typical scenarios include leaks of ethanol-blended      gasoline from underground storage tanks, accidents with railroad cars or      tanker trucks      and spills of neat ethanol at distribution terminals. One of the major      concerns regarding ethanol releases is its potential to cosolubilize benzene      and other      aromatic compounds in groundwater.There have been some prior laboratory studies that have addressed the cosolubilization  of benzene by ethanol, including research by Dr. Rixey at the University of  Houston. However, a larger-scale investigation is needed to more thoroughly  address the environmental implications associated with the use of ethanol additive  fuels.

9,"Objective(s): Certain common dietary factors appear to be capable of: 1) affecting growth and development; 2) transiently and permanently altering metabolism; 3) influencing body composition; and 4) preventing some diseases.  For example, fruits, vegetables, grains and milk contain natural compounds (phytochemicals, peptides and proteins) that can alter development, physiology and metabolism, which can ultimately lead to disease prevention and phenotypic changes.  We will: 1) document which foods and dietary factors can alter body composition either in children or in offspring born to mothers who consume those foods; 2) determine how much of and in what context, these foods are needed to affect body composition; 3) study dietary factors in foods commonly consumed by children, such as fruits, rice, milk, and soy to determine how they may affect calorie balance and diseases associated with energy utilization (such obesity-associated insulin resistance), cardiovascular disease, and breast cancer; 4) identify the biologically active dietary factors and determine their bioavailability, the doses required for specific effects and their mechanisms of action; 5) determine the direct and indirect effects of dietary factors and the interactions of these factors with endogenous signals in human subjects and animal models throughout early life stages and phenotypes. For example, the isoflavones (also called  phytoestrogens ) are particularly concentrated in soybeans and can have many of the same actions as the major female hormones in women, the estrogens. Countries with regular consumption of large amounts of soy foods report lower incidence of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and obesity; and factors in soy (isoflavones and peptides) are postulated as being partially responsible. The soy connection to long-term health is important, because one million U.S. infants are fed infant formula containing soy protein each year and the phytoestrogen content in their blood is extremely high. Virtually nothing is known about the actions of these substances in children, nor on the long-term health consequences of this early exposure. Since this affects nearly 25% of America's youngest people, it is essential to ascertain the long-term health consequences, both positive and negative, of early consumption of these phytochemicals.  This is just one example of several foods containing different phytochemicals that have potential health effects during development.Approach:Studies will focus on the various dietary factors found in foods commonly comsumed by children, such as fruits, rice, milk, and soy to determine their long-term health effects in infants and children. Phytochemicals (such as the isoflavones), proteins and peptides will be studied to determine the possible effects on risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other chronic diseases.  For example, evidence suggests that exposure to soy foods early in life will reduce the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease later in life. Similarly, we suspect that there may be some as yet unrecognized effects related to hormonally sensitive systems that regulate energy metabolism and fat disposition that affect development of obesity, drug efficacy, bone development, and insulin sensitivity. We will conduct laboratory, animal, and clinical studies to test these hypotheses, determine the positive and negative health consequences of maternal body composition and of various foods and dietary factors in maternal diet, infant formula, and childrenÆs foods, especially as it relates to safety and disease prevention; understand which phytochemicals have health consequences, how much and how often they should be consumed, and at what age they should be eaten; and, whether it is possible to reduce the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and under what circumstances. This same approach will be utilized for dietary factors in other foods.

14,"Objective(s): Determine the effects of genetic, pre-harvest, and post-harvest factors on 1) the production of key volatile compounds, and 2) starch and protein composition, that in turn, affect the sensory quality of rice.  Develop rapid instrumental methods for the assessment of the sensory quality of rice based on measurement of, 1) key volatile compounds and their precursors, and 2) the fine structure of starch.Approach:Using identical cultivation practices, diverse cultivars will be grown at, 1) the same location to determine cultivar differences in flavor and texture, and 2) at differing locations to ascertain whether certain cultivars are more robust than others in displaying flavor and texture stable to environment factors.  Diverse cultivars will also be grown with different fertilizer inputs and with differing drain and harvest times to determine the effects of these variables on flavor and texture.  The effects of cooking and cooking method on flavor development and texture will also be evaluated.  The intensities of flavor and texture attributes will be correlated with volatile compound profiles and starch and protein compositional data to determine the basis for sensory quality differences.  Physiochemical measurements that correlate with sensory properties will be used in Objective 2 to develop rapid instrumental methods that replace the time-intensive human sensory evaluations. Solid phase microextraction/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (SPME/MS/MS) and high speed SPME/gas chromatography (GC)/MS methods will be developed to detect and accurately measure specific flavor components of rice.

15,"AbstractThe genetic engineering of complex  traits into crop plants will ultimately require strategies to co-express  more than one protein at the same time. In  this project, we developed a ubiquitin (Ub)-based expression method capable of  generating multiple, separate proteins from a single transcript. The vector contains coding regions for the  proteins of interest, separated in-frame by the coding region for the C-terminal  end of Ub followed by a full-length Ub. Upon  expression in plants, this polycistronic mRNA is translated to produce a  chimeric protein that is rapidly processed by endogenous Ub-specific proteases  (UBPs) to release the two proteins plus a Ub moiety in intact forms. Whereas the C-terminal protein is released  without additional amino acids (aa),  the N-terminal protein domain retains the short C-terminal end of the  Ub sequence. Analysis of  this vector system in yeast, tobacco, and Arabidopsis indicates that multiple proteins can  be released by this method from a single large transcript. Quantitation of the products from a l uciferease  (LUC)-Ub-&beta;-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion indicates that stoichiometric  accumulation often occurs. Deletion  analysis revealed that the Ub moiety appended to the N-terminal protein can be  reduced in length to just  six amino  acids and still promote cleavage by UBPs in both yeast and tobacco. From this work, it appears that Ub-based  polyprotein vectors can provide a simple method for the coordinated and  stoichiometric synthesis of two or more proteins in plants. IntroductionThe genetic engineering of crop  plants has enormous potential to increase agricultural production while  simultaneously minimizing chemical inputs and environmental impact. Possibilities include the development of  plants with enhanced nutritional value and biomass ;  greater resistance to herbicides, insects, and  pathogens; or the ability to economically  synthesize pharmaceuticals, vaccines, industrial proteins, and polymers. Current approaches typically involve the  manipulation of simple traits that require only one transgenic protein. However, as more  complex traits are attempted, methods to allow the introduction of multiple  proteins will be needed. Examples  include the use of plants to co-express the two subunits of antibodies, generate  plants with both herbicide and insect resistance, or to introduce the entire  enzymatic pathways needed to synthesize vitamin A or biodegradable plastics.Current methods for introducing  multiple proteins involve either transforming multiple genes simultaneously or  using repeated rounds of transformation to individually introduce each gene. With both methods, achieving and maintaining  balanced expression for each protein is a challenge given the genetic  independence of the introduced loci. A  more subtle complication can also arise in subsequent generations if the genes  unpredictably vary their expression levels independent of the other gene(s). Transgene silencing, which can effectively  suppress gene activity, may further complicate expression if the same promoter  is used multiple times to drive transcription (Baulcombe, 1996). These problems are best illustrated by the  time -consuming  procedures needed to engineer Arabidopsis to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) plastics, tobacco to make  antibodies, and rice seeds to synthesize Vitamin A  (Hiatt,  et al., 1989; During,  et al., 1990; Poirier,  et al., 1992; Poirier,  et al., 1995; Ye,  et al., 2000). Ultimately, the movement of multiple  transgenes into elite cultivars will require expanded genotypic analyses that  grow exponentially as the number of proteins needed to confer a particular  trait(s) increases.Obviously, new strategies are  needed for expressing more than one transgenic protein in plants.

17,"Objective(s): This research project objective is to assess the effects of weed management and conservation practices on soil biological, chemical, and physical properties under Mississippi Delta conditions.  This will provide an understanding of the interactions between alteration of soil properties by crop and weed management practices and their influence on herbicide fate.  This information will be used to develop strategies to both improve herbicide efficacy and reduce the environmental impact of herbicide use.Approach:Assessment of weed and conservation practices on the environmental fate of herbicides in soil and plant residues will be assessed in laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions. Most field investigations will study long-term changes in soil properties associated with reduced tillage, cover crops, and residue management to determine how suites of best management practices can be developed to facilitate herbicide effectiveness with minimal potential for adverse effects on the environment.  Edge-of-field practices such as filter strips will be assessed to make recommendations on the most effective materials for removal and processing of herbicide contaminants.  Field and laboratory research on the environmental fate of the herbicide s-metolachlor will be part of a national effort to examine the role of edaphic factors in degradation kinetics of this herbicide to develop into a predictive model for ascertaining herbicide efficacy and minimize environmental risks.  Factors associated with herbicide dissipation, e.g., herbicide degradation, sorption and movement, and specific microbial degradation pathways, will be studied to determine interactions among weed management practices and the environmental fate of herbicides.  The effects of using transgenic crops resistant to the herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate on soil microflora and plant-microbial interactions will be evaluated, specifically nitrogen fixation and nitrogen assimilation.  The ecology of soil microflora and associated microbial processes will be studied in legume cover crop systems for cotton and flooding systems for a rice soybean rotation.

The large number of genetic mutants, in combination with the ease of obtaining and mapping additional mutants, makes maize an excellent system for determining the function of genes. We propose to identify genes that regulate maize leaf development and shoot architecture. We will carry out mutagenesis with defined inbreds using the chemical mutagen EMS. Mutants will be characterized genetically and histologically. The genes will be mapped to position and cloned. The functions will be determined by expression analysis and further genetics. We already have two mutants at different stages of analysis. The dominant Liguleless narrow mutant has been mapped to position and beginning characterization is under way. The dominant Wavy auricle in blade1 (Wab1) mutant has been localized to a BAC contig. Once we clone Wab1, we will determine the function of the wild-type gene product. In order to follow expression of the genes we clone, we have developed a vector for gene fusions. We are presently testing this vector with the liguleless1 gene. REPLACES 5335-21000-018-00D (4/06).

22,"Objective(s): Develop transformation expression vectors to target transgene expression to tissues initially infected by Fusarium graminearum.  Identify genes upregulated during infection of seed lemma and epicarp; clone and test their promoters for inducibility and tissue-specificity.  Develop antifungal genes to use in targeted expression system to develop Fusarium-resistant barley.  Identify components of the GA response to predictors of malting quality.  Determine whether the gene for a barley aleurone GA receptor can be used as an indicator of malting quality.  Analyze gene responses to GA in malting barley and GA response mutants under malting conditions.  Approach:Produce gene macroarrays from our lemma-specific gene library and a new epicarp-specific library.  Probe libraries with cDNA from Fusarium-infected lemma and epicarp.

Promoter (upstream) regions will be ligated upstream of the green fluorescent protein gene in an expression vector and functionally confirmed in transient bombardment assays where tissues will be examined for fluorescence before and after infection with Fusarium.  If successful, barley will be stably transformed with antifungal protein genes driven by these promoters using the Agrobacterium vector pRSHyg.  These genes (cloned in this lab) include lemma thionin, Ltp, and germin.  Transformants will be tested for Fusarium resistance.  The gene for the barley gibberellin (GA) hormone receptor will be cloned using homologies to the rice receptor.  The gene will be compared in GA response mutants.  Receptor sequence and mRNA levels will be analyzed in barleys of varying malting qualities.  The Barley1 GeneChip will be used to examine transcripts in 7 malting barleys and GA response mutants.

Specifically, evaluate and relate the quality of runoff from irrigated fields to determine current and potential environmental risks of sediment, nutrients, and/or pesticides leaving the fields.Approach:To optimize irrigated crop production and protect soil and water resources in the Mid-South, it is necessary to consider natural soil variability within fields, the range of crops and production systems, and the types of irrigation systems employed. Our interdisciplinary team will address limitations to the overall goal of improving performance, profitability, and sustainability of Mid-South agriculture. We will investigate ways to improve irrigation scheduling and mechanized-irrigation-system management in spatially-variable soils. We will explore use of commercial sensors to provide information regarding crop water status and flood-water depth.

24,"PI: Ghovanloo, MaysamProposal Number: 0828882Problem Statement: The number of people with disabilities is increasing among all age groups, especially the elderly (+65) who currently comprise 12% of the U.S. population. Individuals severely disabled as a result of various causes from spinal cord injuries to stroke, cerebral palsy, and ALS find it extremely difficult to carry out everyday tasks without continuous help. Despite the wide variety of assistive technologies (AT) available for individuals with lower levels of disabilities, the above population is still considered underserved, and would greatly benefit from having more choices, particularly in utilizing adaptable ATs that can take advantage of whatever remaining capabilities that they might have. We intend to help individuals with little or no upper extremity functions to improve their quality of life by enabling them to control their environment, drive their powered wheelchair (PWC), and access computers by simply moving their tongue. Intellectual Merits: The main purpose of the proposed research is to develop an unobtrusive, minimally invasive, low cost, and wireless AT called the 'Tongue Drive' system (TDS), which can potentially substitute some of the arm and hand functions in people with quadriplegia. Conceptually, the TDS consists of an array of small magnetic sensors located inside the mouth, on an orthodontic brace (internal version - iTDS), or outside of the mouth, mounted on a headset (external version - eTDS). The sensor array measures the magnetic field of a small permanent magnet, the size of a grain of rice, which is attached to the tongue by means of tissue adhesives, implantation, piercing, or clipping. The sensor signals are transmitted wirelessly to an external ultra-portable PC, which is worn by the user. The received data is processed to determine the coordinates, orientation, and relative motion of the magnet with respect to the array of sensors in real time. This information is then used to control the movements of a cursor on the PC screen, and to perform all other functions that can be done with a mouse pointer or a joystick. The principal advantage of the TDS is that a few magnetic sensors and an inherently wireless permanent magnet could potentially capture an unlimited number of tongue movements, each of which can represent a specific user command. A set of dedicated tongue movements could be tailored for each individual user based on his/her preferences, lifestyle, and remaining abilities, and mapped onto a set of customized functions for computer, PWC, and environmental access. Thus, TDS can offer a high degree of adaptability and cover a large group of users with different levels of disabilities. In addition, the TDS has the potential to provide its users with proportional control, which makes it a lot easier to maneuver PWCs in crowded and confined spaces. This research also involves a thorough evaluation of the TDS efficacy, usability and user acceptability.Broader Impacts: We intend to help the most severely disabled individuals to live active, selfsupportive, satisfying, and productive lives, equal to the other members of the society. Paralysis is considered to be one of the most expensive types of disabilities. Solutions such as the TDS could help reduce healthcare and assisted-living costs, increase the employability of people with disabilities, and allow users to participate more fully in the society, while relieving their family members or dedicated caregivers.Educational Plan: The PI's main educational objective is to stimulate the interests of undergraduate and graduate students by taking advantage of the 'multidisciplinary' nature of the proposed research. Undergraduates will be recruited through senior design and presidential undergraduate research award (PURA) to participate in development of the TDS graphical userinterface. A graduate student will also be involved in the proposed research by developing the TDS hardware and sensor signal processing algorithms as well as helping with human trials. age group; Algorithms; arm; Assisted Living Facilities; Award; base; Braces-Orthopedic appliances; Caregivers; Cereals; Cerebral Palsy; Clip; computerized data processing; Computers; Confined Spaces; cost; Crowding; Data; design; Development; disability; Disabled Persons; Elderly; Environment; Evaluation; Family member; graduate student; Hand functions; Healthcare; Human; implantation; improved; Individual; interest; Joystick; Life; Life Style; Living Costs; magnetic field; Magnetism; Maps; Measures; member; minimally invasive; Motion; Movement; multidisciplinary; Mus; Nature; Oral cavity; Orthodontic; Paralysed; Population; Powered wheelchair; preference; Process; Quadriplegia; Quality of life; Recruitment Activity; Relative (related person); Research; Rice; Self-Help Devices; sensor; Signal Transduction; Societies; Solutions; Spinal cord injury; stroke; System; Time; Tissue Adhesives; Tongue; Upper Extremity; usability; Wheelchairs; Wireless TechnologyWIRELESS TRACKING OF TONGUE MOVEMENTS FOR WHEELCHAIR CONTROL AND COMPUTER ACCESS",0.999999,1e-06,0.02348810984299944,1e-06,0.9999981843772583,1.4639552054033592e-05,1e-06
25,"PI: Luca Comai (University of California - Davis)CoPIs: Jorge Dubcovsky (University of California - Davis) and Steven Henikoff (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle)Collaborator: Robert Tran and Dawei Lin (University of California - Davis). The growing information on gene sequence and function stimulates interest in pathways expected to have large effects on important agronomic and quality traits. Nevertheless, while more and more genes are valuable inactivation targets, approaches for crop gene modification that can flexibly target 50 to 3000 genes per crop species are limited. This project will apply ultra-high throughput sequencing to TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes), a general method for the discovery of induced mutations in genes of interest. Working with rice and wheat TILLING lines, it will employ PCR-mediated amplification from pooled genomic templates to target dozens to hundreds of genes. The research will test and implement several technical and computational methods to resolve real mutations from errors in highly complex templates. To target hundreds to thousands of genes, the project will use sequence barcoding to create DNA pools of short adapter-ligated random fragments from hundreds or thousands of existing TILLING lines of Arabidopsis, and later rice and wheat. Aliquots from an amplified pool will be subjected to a capture procedure using custom programmable arrays or long oligos attached to either microarrays or beads, and the eluted fragments subjected to Solexa sequencing. The project will build an economical and effective pipeline that will be sustainable as a user-supported service, superseding more laborious and expensive nucleotide mismatch-detection technology. Rice and wheat span the range of critical characteristics and can therefore serve as models for all crops. They differ in ploidy, diploid versus allopolyploid, sequence information, high versus low, genome size, small versus large, and mutation density, moderate versus very high. While developing a sequencing approach to TILLING, the project will use already existing and tested populations to target a set of genes in each crop that will be useful to the community of scientist and breeders. Thus, this research will facilitate breeding of improved crop varieties by providing facile isolation and analysis of variants. This research will provide methods for efficient TILLING of crop plants. By doing so, it will stimulate both basic discovery as well as targeted trait improvement. For example, in wheat independent inactivation of homeologous gene sets followed by breeding can address a host of important agronomic and quality traits. Because discovery of mutations by direct sequencing will allow researchers to choose ab initio which mutant to characterize, in silico collections of induced mutations will provide powerful resources for breeding communities. The developed methods will not only be useful for TILLING but also to discover natural variation, or to identify allelic changes underlying quantitative trait loci. The connected outreach program combines the undergraduate and professional training. It is based on three approaches: an internship program that will pair students and teachers from underrepresented populations with laboratory-to-field experimental genomic pipeline, a database and methods web site, and a yearly workshop for training crop scientists. Data and methods will be accessible to the public through the project web site (http://tilling.ucdavis.edu) and through established genomics databases (http://www.gramene.org/; http://www.arabidopsis.org/).

26,"Organismal phenotypes are controlled by complex networks that buffer against mutation, environmental noise or error ensuring the proper phenotype is produced. In contrast, most phenotypes vary between individuals of a species allowing for evolution. This includes the plant metabolome that has complex enzymatic interactions and is controlled by intricate signaling interactions but also shows inter-specific variation. One poorly understood mechanism that can allow networks to show extensive phenotypic variation is multi-locus epistasis that simultaneously impacts multiple nodes of a network. Epistasis is frequently found in naturally variable systems such as crop yield and human disease susceptibility but the molecular mechanism is rarely identified. This project will use natural variation in the rice and Arabidopsis metabolomes as model systems to identify mechanisms by which metabolomic Quantitative Trait Loci form an epistatic network that constrains potential variation present within the metabolome. The project builds on previous studies in the model system Arabidopsis thaliana that identified eight naturally variable loci that epistatically interact in a genetic network to control swaths of Arabidopsis primary metabolism. Specific allele combinations at four of these loci lead to plants with 800% increases in steady state content of metabolites within part of the TCA cycle.  Specific objectives include cloning the genes underlying these loci and manipulating the homologous genes in rice to test their ability to control primary metabolism in a monocot crop.  In addition, precise measures of epistasis in the Arabidopsis and rice metabolomes will be made by analyzing a large Recombinant Inbred Line population in each species. Finally the data generated will be used to develop a metabolic network de novo using a logic based algorithm that has identified novel metabolic networks in other metabolomics data. In the future, this knowledge will allow for the development of models that integrate natural variation in plant metabolic networks to potentially predict phenotypic diversity. Analysis of natural variation in most organisms focuses on single genes of large effect due to relative ease of identification and modeling. However, this is only one aspect of natural variation and organismal evolution. In contrast, most traits are under complex control including significant epistasis with large phenotypic consequences. This proposal will begin to provide insights into how epistasis and biological networks may control complex traits. Understanding complex epistatic interactions will provide insights into other complex traits such as crop yield and human disease that are under epistatic control. The proposed project will provide research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Students will be trained in modern metabolic biochemistry and molecular genetics to prepare them for future careers in industry or academics. The undergraduate students will be highly encouraged and guided to develop and devise their own projects within the frame of this proposal. Any publication likely to result from this proposal will likely include at least one undergraduate student as a co-author who was integral in designing and interpreting the experiments. Established outreach programs will be used to recruit minority students from local high schools and colleges throughout the USA for summer internships. In addition, the principal investigator will be involved in teaching, both in a university classroom setting and in ongoing outreach efforts to educate community members about plant metabolism, quantitative genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology and their integration in factorial experiments. All data will be available through the project website and long-term through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR: www.arabidopsis.org) and Gramene (www.gramene.org).

The interactions of rice and associated pathogens are an important topic and an excellent opportunity for in-depth analyses of the adaptive processes of plant disease susceptibility and defense. The two pathovars of Xanthomonas oryzae, the causal agents of bacterial blight and leaf streak of rice, cause disease in part by modulating host plant gene expression. Global changes in rice gene expression will be characterized during the disease process and during successful defense responses to identify the host genes that control host susceptibility and resistance (R) to bacterial infection. Additionally, since pathogen populations have evolved over time in response to new genetic mechanisms of resistance in the host, the project will characterize the diversity of adaptations based on host responses to infection by different pathogen strains. Mutant rice lines and manipulation of host gene expression by inhibitory RNA (RNAi) will be employed to determine the functional significance of selected candidate host genes involved in disease and defense responses. The project will carry out (1) profiling of host transcriptional responses in rice cultivar Nipponbare, as well as other diverse host genotypes (domestic rice and wild relatives) to three sequenced strains of the pathogens using microarray gene chip hybridization and quantitative, real time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods; (2) profiling of responses of a set of rice lines near-isogenic for either recessive or dominant R genes to define pathways for susceptibility and induced innate immunity; and 3) functional analyses of candidate host susceptibility and defense genes and associated gene families using gene transfer, RNAi, and mutagenesis techniques. Array data will be deposited to PlexDB (http://www.plexdb.org/)and other project outcomes will be available through http://www.oznet.ksu.edu/plantpath/whiteslab/welcome.htm.This project will elucidate the processes in rice susceptibility and resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak, and establish important, broadly relevant concepts of plant-pathogen interactions. The results will provide insight into strategies for achieving durable and broad resistance against disease, which, in itself, can have wide-reaching impacts on the environment and quality of life. The work will enhance the educational environments at Iowa State University and Kansas State University and strengthen international collaborative research. The participating research programs will foster the participation of scientists at all levels of education and internationally. Each of the investigators contributes strongly to research programs for both resident and visiting undergraduate students, including the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SUROP) at Kansas state University, REU and RET programs at Iowa State University, and individually tailored research and supplemental coursework.

How roots branch in soil is known as the plant's 'root system architecture' and it varies dramatically from plant to plant. These differences are known to impact the plant's ability to acquire water and nutrients. Since many plants have to deal with environments in which nutrients and water are limiting, the root system architecture is a central feature of how plants adapt to their environment. A better understanding of root system architecture addresses two of the major challenges confronting plant biology - how to feed a burgeoning world population in a sustainable manner and how to cope with global climate change. Poor soil fertility and environmental stress suppress crop yields in many parts of the world, and many models predict these stresses will increase in coming decades. Intensive irrigation and fertilization are not environmentally sustainable, nor economically viable in most developing countries. Thus, identifying the genes that underlie root system architecture could have a profound significance for agriculture and world food security. Surprisingly, little is known about the individual traits that comprise root system architecture. There are two principal issues that have restricted the understanding of the genetic basis of root system architecture: 1) the lack of cost-effective methods for non-invasively imaging growing roots and 2) the lack of adequate means of describing the complex spatial structure of root system architecture. Two non-invasive imaging technologies will be used in this project to acquire images of growing rice and maize roots under different environmental conditions. Response of root systems will be compared to responses when grown in soil under similar conditions. Mathematical approaches to describing growing root systems and simulations for comparing different root system architectures will be developed.  Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for root architecture traits will be identified using special populations of rice and maize and efforts will be initiated toward isolating genes of significance to plant breeding.The broader impacts of this work stem, in part,  from the nature of this research that it is inherently interdisciplinary, thus training at various levels (undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral) will integrate quantitative approaches with applications to experimental biology. A course will be developed in collaboration with faculty at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) that focuses on understanding complex genetic traits. NCCU is a historically black university (HBCU) located 5 miles from the Duke campus. The course will use examples from plants as well as human disease to inform and educate undergraduates as to the issues involved in analyzing complex genetic traits and the cutting edge technologies and computational approaches now available for identifying the genes responsible for these traits.  For qualified students who have taken this course, research internships will be provided.  A website will be developed to disseminate the results from this project, as well as to describe methods and results of interest to researchers and breeders.

Zhang, Univ. of Missouri, ColumbiaThe soybean crop is a major source of vegetable protein and edible oil.  A thorough understanding of soybean genetics is essential for the development of new soybean varieties that will meet the nutritional, environmental, and industrial requirements that soybean will fulfill over the next decades.  Soybean has many research tools available that facilitate its genetic study.  However, there has been one genetic tool notably absent for soybean, namely the availability of reverse genetic tools; that is, a way to identify and determine the function of soybean genes that hold academic, biological or agricultural importance.  Therefore, the long-term goal of this project is to develop and distribute the resources to needed to investigate the function of soybean genes, especially those involved in soybean quality and yield.  This goal will be accomplished by building and cataloging a collection of soybean deletion, insertional, and gene activation mutants derived by engineering soybeans with genes from rice, tobacco or maize that naturally move around the genome and insert themselves into other genes.  Such mutants alter the appearance of the plant, or can be detected in the laboratory.  Moreover, the team will investigate the use of fast neutrons to enhance their ability to find the desired mutations.  The research team will then compare the relative efficiency and effectiveness of the various techniques.Not only will soybean geneticists, breeders, farmers and consumers benefit from the information this project derives, but the set of transposon tools developed by this proposal will be available and useful for any dicot crop.  Furthermore, any soybean plants that are immediately useful for additional genetic studies or for use in the development of new varieties will be immediately available to the geneticists or breeders who need and request them on a cost-recovery basis.  The research will be executed in large part by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, effectively helping train the next generation of soybean breeders and geneticists.  In addition, each participating state has a series of small research projects that are specifically designed to interest and engage promising high school and undergraduate students in science and scientific careers.Soybean oil and protein are already substrates for numerous industrial and alimentary uses.  It is expected that new, designer oils and proteins can be used for everything from healthier diets to nutraceuticals to novel industrial compounds to biodiesel.  The genetic knowledge and information on the available seed stocks will be made available to the public via a web site (http://digbio.missouri.edu/gmgenedb/index.php) designed for the purpose, presentations by the scientists of their work at scientific meetings, and reports of the work published in peer-reviewed journals.

30,"The Cereal Genomics Workshop at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will give plant biologists the skills necessary to navigate the increasingly complex genomics information landscape, and to identify and encourage young researchers who might choose plant genomics as a career by exposing them to the field's practice and practitioners. A major aim will therefore be to enable students and post docs to take advantage of emerging genomics data in the cereals. Specific problems and unique challenges exist in cereal genomics. Many of the genomes (for example, maize, wheat, barley) are large and complex, and it is unlikely that we will have completely mapped and sequenced genomes for these species in the foreseeable future. The cereals also provide the primary source of nourishment to the world's human and domesticated animal populations. This workshop will provide young students and scientists with the tools and skills they need to exploit the emerging genome data in all cereal crops including complete genome sequences (rice, maize, sorghum) and extensive EST and genome survey sequence from wheat and other grasses.  The broader impacts of this workshop will be in exposing young students to the excitement of cereal genomics, as well as enabling more senior researchers to develop cutting edge research and curricular activities.

31,"This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled  A quantitative ethnobotanical approach to determining the movement of plants between Southeast Asian and Hawaii  for Nathaniel Bletter. The host institution for this research is University of Hawaii-Manoa and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Will McClatchey. How does the diversity of plant uses change as immigrant communities spend more time away from their home country, in proximity to and exchanging plant knowledge with many neighboring ethnic communities? This question is especially important in Southeast Asia with its patterns of immigration and emigration, as this area is the origin of much of the world's important economic flora, such as rice, coconuts, bananas, tea, and ginseng. In conjunction with the University of Hawai'i and Thailand's Khon Kaen University's  Taxonomy and Ethnobotany in the Lao People's Democratic Republic  project, this research seeks to answer this question using a quantitative  synthesis of the relationships of the plant species, their uses, and the cultures that  employ plants in order to understand the patterns of transfer of plant uses by employing field interviews with Thai and Lao speakers in Hawai'i, Thailand  and Laos and plant collections in these areas. Plant data are being analyzed using  ethnobotanical quantum  units and plant use data using phylogenetic  relational efficacy.   Broader impacts include sharing and preserving this valuable plant knowledge within the communities via books and training. The hypothesis being tested is that, over time in a new country, immigrant plant use diversity initially decreases, but eventually increases with exposure to other cultures, and that newly selected plants are phylogenetically similar to the pre-immigration set of plants. Through a combination of quantum and relational efficacy ethnobotanical theory another hypothesis being modeled predicts which plants people will bring with them when they move from one area to another. Quantum ethnobotany predicts that the transferred plants are those that best help the most people survive and relational efficacy predicts that the transferred plants are those that have many closely related useful species. Through these various computational methods spanning the field  of biology, it is being observed how different cultures communicate their most valued plant knowledge, leading to a broader impact of being able to understand and possibly prevent introductions of new invasive plant species while being better able to find the origins of important crops for breeding of pest-resistant varieties. Training objectives include new techniques and skills of quantitative and theoretical ethnobotany, phytochemistry, geographic information systems, research ethics, and field methods.

32,"Robust homeostastic mechanisms are key to cellular survival. Cells must maintain stable and optimal intracellular conditions for proficient enzymatic and metabolic processes. However, a highly dynamic and often stressful environment inevitably leads to cellular disturbances. Increases in cytosolic free calcium and reactive oxygen species are examples of intracellular changes that result from many environmental stresses. Cells have evolved mechanisms to use these changes as second messengers. Calcium and redox sensor proteins perceive these signs of stress and convey information that activates not only cellular and physiological adaptive responses but also counterbalancing mechanisms to regain cellular homeostasis. The Arabidopsis CML24 protein may be not only a calmodulin-related calcium sensor but also a redox sensor. CML24 undergoes calcium-dependent conformational changes and also has the potential to form a disulfide bond in response to oxidation. Plants with mutant CML24 have altered nitric oxide accumulation and autophagy regulation. Thus, nitric oxide and autophagy regulation may be functionally linked in plants and such links may be critical for cellular homeostasis. The roles of calcium and redox in CML24 conformation, stability, protein interaction, and physiological function will be determined through biochemical, biophysical, and molecular genetic approaches.  CML24's role in nitric oxide accumulation will be investigated through determining, in part, whether CML24 functions in an NOA1-, nitrate reductase-, and/or mitochondria-dependent nitric oxide synthesis pathway. Autophagy will be monitored to reveal whether CML24, and its calcium-binding ability and disulfide bond formation, are critical for regulation. Nitric oxide accumulation and autophagy mutants, in addition to cml24 mutants, will be characterized to determine potential linkages among nitric oxide, redox, and autophagy regulation.Broader ImpactsThis research will address fundamental and important questions about cellular stress perception and response and may bring transformative insight into the roles of calcium, redox, nitric oxide, and autophagy in cellular homeostasis. Such processes are critical for plant survival and productivity. Knowledge derived from these studies should aid practices aimed at improving agricultural efficiency and preserving natural environments under stress. Through the involvement of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, this research will enhance the infrastructure of research and training. Students supported by this grant will be encouraged to participate in conferences and teaching opportunities. Training of women and students of underrepresented groups will be a high priority. Outreach activities, such as lab tours, science fair judging, and NSF Advance activities, will continue. Research results will be disseminated widely through publication, conference presentations, and websites. Mutants and transgenic lines will be freely accessible to the community.

33,"This award is an outcome of the NSF 08-519 program solicitation George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research (NEESR) competition and includes Rice University as the lead institution with subawards to the University at Buffalo, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, University of California-Los Angeles, and California State University-Fresno. Conventionally designed structural frame systems develop significant inelastic deformations under strong earthquakes, leading to inelastic hysteretic behavior, stiffness and strength degradation, increased interstory drifts, and damage with residual drift. Passive seismic protection systems in the form of supplemental damping devices have emerged as an effective approach for reducing response and limiting damage by shifting the inelastic energy dissipation from the framing system to the dampers. However, such dampers do not generally provide self-centering stiffness capability or counter stiffness degradation. Recent investigations have shown that a combination of adaptive stiffness and damping (ASD) devices can provide substantial response modification, particularly during near-fault pulse-type earthquakes. ASD devices offer structural response modification capability by optimally varying the restoring forces (stiffness) linked to the frequencies of vibration and dissipative forces (damping) that govern the behavior of a structural dynamic system. To date, adaptive stiffness systems have received relatively little attention as compared to supplemental damping systems and thus represent a significant gap in earthquake engineering. Hence, development of new ASD devices is necessary to shift the energy dissipation and associated stiffness variations from the structural system to the ASD devices to reduce damage in frames, eliminate residual interstory drift, and provide self-centering capability.  The research vision of this project is to develop the next generation of seismic protection systems by combining a new class of self-centering adaptive stiffness systems with highly efficient energy dissipation. The goal is to mimic the behavior of actively controlled devices by developing self-contained semi-active ASD devices with feedback and passive ASD devices with internal hydraulic feedback. The core strategy involves a comprehensive analytical and experimental investigation of potential active, semiactive, and passive systems followed by the synthesis and development of practical adjustable passive systems and self-contained semi-active systems for implementation in practical structures. Such an approach is consistent with that adopted in the defense industry and is expected to result in widespread application of ASD systems in civil structures. The project is expected to advance the state-of-the-art of increased resilience through structural response modification, contributing to earthquake hazard mitigation and expedient post earthquake recovery (due to easy replacement of ASD systems). The project will broadly impact earthquake engineering practice through educational outreach and wide dissemination of research findings through the project web site. Additionally, the project will have a significant impact on students from underrepresented groups through active involvement of a Hispanic Serving Institution.

34,"Beggiatoa alba is a microorganism with a number of unusual features. It lives poised at the oxic/anoxic interface of  aquatic habitats where sulfide concentrations are at commonly toxic levels, it has gliding motility and filaments of some Beggiatoa are large enough to be visible to the naked eye. Gliding motility is still poorly understood, even though the ability to move on solid surfaces and within biofilms would be of tremendous environmental, industrial and medical importance. Beggiatoa are distributed worldwide. Because of its distribution and its ability to detoxify sulfide, this microbe is important in the sulfur cycle of many coastal environments. The Joint Genome Institute/DOE is supporting a shotgun (draft) genome sequencing of B. alba strain B18LD.  With this project, Mueller at Morgan State University will be carrying out a detailed genomic characterization of B. alba B18LD. This characterization will involve identifying as many of the gene functions as possible in the genome. The goals for this investigator will be to evaluate the role of this microbe in the cycling of sulfur, carbon and nitrogen in sulfide-rich habitats such as wetlands, rice paddy fields, methane-seeps, and wastewater treatment plants; to analyze global gene expression patterns involved in sulfide oxidation and carbon metabolism, and to examine the molecular components of behavioral responses to sulfide and oxygen and of gliding motility. Not only is Beggiatoa important because of its ecophysiology and behavior but Beggiatoa spp. have been used in teaching ever since Winogradsky formulated the concept of chemolithotrophy (growth on inorganic substrates) in 1888. Mueller will be using the genome sequence of B. alba as a teaching tool in his bioinformatics courses as well as in his environmental microbiology courses at Morgan State University, which is a Historically Black University in Baltimore, MD. Most of the students in these courses are from populations traditionally underrepresented in science. His goal is to draw interest to the fields of genomic science and bioinformatics as career choices. In addition, the investigator will be establishing a B. alba B18LD genome web page for open-access usage and input by the scientific community. The results of expression profiling will be made available on the web page on a regular basis.

35,"As sessile organisms, plants must constantly defend themselves from potential microbial pathogens. For protection, plants have developed effective defense mechanisms initiated by the extracellular detection of the potential pathogen. However, the signaling pathways that translate extracellular recognition of pathogens into the plant?s resistance are poorly understood. Therefore, identification and characterization of individual signaling components in a cereal crop such as rice will lead to a broader understanding of the defense response in all cereals. The project will use advanced biochemical approaches to identify signaling components activated in rice plants resistant to the bacterial pathogen that causes bacterial leaf blight, a devastating disease of rice throughout the world. Reverse genetic approaches will be used to test if these newly identified signaling components play a significant role in mediating resistance against the bacterial pathogen. The project is expected to identify at least 10-20 new signaling components and to test by reverse genetics 10 of the most promising candidates for their role in resistance against pathogens. Improving knowledge about how the plant responds to invasion by potential pathogens is critical for improving plant yields and quality. Moreover, rice is the leading genomics system for the agriculturally important cereals. Therefore, results from this study will directly benefit researchers studying pathogen stress in other cereal crops.

Preliminary data indicates that copper and silver nanoparticles are acutely toxic in zebrafish and daphnia. The proposed studies will investigate the biological fate and toxicity of metallic nanoparticles in various trophic levels. The overall hypothesis is that exposure to metallic nanoparticles will result in bioaccumulation and trophic transfer different than soluble forms of the metal. Moreover, long-term exposure to nanometallics may produce toxicity that is qualitatively and quantitatively different than soluble metals. To address these hypotheses, 3 specific aims are proposed: 1) To determine metal bioaccumulation and trophic transfer rates in aquatic organisms exposed to metallic nanoparticles; 2) To determine effects of long-term exposure to copper, silver and titania nanomaterials on zebrafish and daphnia; and 3) To determine the role of particle mediated reactive oxygen generation in gill toxicity. To address these aims, zebrafish (Danio rerio) will be exposed to copper, silver, nickel or titanium dioxide as aqueous solutions or nanoparticle suspensions. The uptake and distribution of metal will be determined for each form in T. tubifex, P. subcapitata, D. pulex, and zebrafish. We will then determine trophic transfer from producer to primary consumer and from primary consumer to secondary consumer. Standard protocols will be utilized to examine long-term toxicity of these particles in zebrafish as adults and at early life stages as well as in daphnia life-cycle assays. These studies will identify threshold values for mortality, embryonic and larval survival and reproduction. They will also determine target tissues for toxicity by examining histological, biochemical and molecular markers of toxicity. Comparison of these markers will allow determination of if nanoparticles produce toxicity that differs from soluble forms of the same metal. Finally, the ability of metallic nanoparticles to produce reactive species will be examined the importance of oxidative stress in gill toxicity will be determined. Intellectual Merit: The proposed studies represent an interdisciplinary collaboration of toxicologists, engineers, and aquatic pathologists who bring a unique combination of experience, facilities, and resources to bear on the study of environmental impact of nanotechnology. These studies will determine whether metallic nanoparticles are accumulated and transferred across trophic levels. The effects of long term exposure to copper, silver and titania nanoparticles in aquatic organisms will be identified as well as appropriate markers for their toxicity. Data will be developed that seeks to understand how particle mediated radical production is involved in toxicity. The experiments will evaluate the performance of several standard aquatic toxicity tests for use with nanoparticles and determine their suitability for this purpose. Broader Impacts: This research will provide research training for post-doctoral researchers at the interface of particle science and biology. Investigators on this project are participants in the SEAGEP program and this will be leveraged to provide research opportunities for underrepresented minorities. In addition, the investigators plan to collaborate with other national resources in nanotechnology such as Center for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University and ICON at Rice to disseminate research results to the scientific and educational communities and to society at large. Researchers will also work with the Graham Center for Public Policy at the University of Florida to ensure that research findings are translated to policy makers.

37,"This project studies a paradigm in which nodes cooperate by pooling power and bandwidth resources and where flows interact opportunistically to avoid interference and increase network utilization. The PIs will leverage their existing expertise in cooperative and opportunistic communications to analyze the implications for broader networks of communication nodes. In particular, they will instantiate their design philosophy in three ways:  Node Information Management: While previous network analyses considered only isolated aspects of a node (e.g., channel gain), the project studies a comprehensive network state information, which captures not only physical-layer conditions but also higher-layer information such as queue  state, processing power, and availability of forwarding routes. Novel Network Representations:  Instead of regarding the network as a simple connectivity graph, the PIs will introduce and develop a network representation which incorporates both temporal and spatial relationships between nodes. The PIs refer to this as the trellis representation of the network, and it will enable us to describe cooperative and opportunistic communication in a wide area network. The trellis will provide a structure in which to identify opportunities for physical layer cooperation, determine the impact of cooperation on neighboring nodes and flows, and opportunistically schedule and route competing flows at fine grained time scales.Distributed Cooperative Discovery:  Traditional discovery protocols for determining network connectivity are unable to identify cooperative links.  New techniques will be developed that leverage existing discovery protocols to efficiently locate potential cooperative topologies, which are a key to opportunistic communication. These discovery protocols will recover network state information and enable the use of the trellis representation to identify the optimal cooperative route through the network.With these tools, the PIs will develop and analyze protocols for coordinating cooperative and opportunistic communications in heterogeneous networks. The new protocols will expand access in underserved areas while increasing throughput in existing networks.  This research will have a broad impact on education by engaging undergraduate and graduate students in the Rice Center for Multimedia Communication (CMC) laboratory. Cooperative communication will be integrated into several courses at Rice in the wireless communication and networking areas.

38,"New York University is awarded a grant to develop a public database that provides information about the structure and inferred function of proteins found in two plant genomes ? the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Oryza sativa (rice). Proteins are synthesized in the cell as long polymers that fold to form three-dimensional shapes critical for their function; knowledge of the 3D structure of proteins can be crucial for inferring their specific function.  Multiple state-of-the-art methods for predicting protein structure from protein sequences, including fold-recognition approaches, where protein sequences are mapped onto known folds, and Rosetta de novo structure prediction, where proteins are folded in silico, will be applied to all annotated proteins in these plant genomes. We will also integrate these structure predictions with knowledge of how proteins (and functional sites on folded proteins) evolve, by estimating the phylogenies of all protein domain families in these genomes and identifying positively-selected amino acid sites in these prorein families using codon-based molecular evolution models that can be mapped onto the predicted structures. This integration of structural and evolutionary information will result in annotated functional information inferences that will be useful to a wide cross-section of biologists working on several plant species. These methods will be especially useful for annotating the large fraction of proteins in plant genomes whose functions are currently unknown, the majority of which do not have any annotation of 3D folded structure (i.e., no detectable similarity to another protein with known structure). The bioinformatics resources for this project can also be extended for application to other sequenced plant genomes.  The project is a collaborative effort between New York University and the American Museum of Natural History and will be carried out on the World Community Grid (a loosely coupled computing platform composed of >400,000 volunteers, organized by IBM), sidestepping the computational barrier to the required genome-wide structure prediction in a cost effective way.  By participating in the World Community Grid (wcgrid.org), the project will also provide a forum for explaining plant genomics to several hundred thousand Grid participants spanning all geographic, age, and socioeconomic categories. Finally, the project will be coupled to a continuing education program for high school teachers at the NYU Steinhardt School that will train teachers how to incorporate bioinformatics into high school science curricula.

39,"The next challenge in plant biology is to discern the function of the many genes revealed through the various genome sequencing projects. One important approach for understanding gene function is to study the consequence of removing or knocking out the function of a specific gene. In the model plant Arabidopsis, efficient methods are available to knock out many genes of interest. Functional analysis, however, is often frustrated by genetic redundancy or the presence of multiple copies of the same or closely related genes.  Particularly prevalent in plants are tandem gene duplications, and as many as 15% of Arabidopsis genes are organized in tandem arrays.  A targeted mutagenesis protocol will be developed to augment existing approaches for understanding Arabidopsis gene function, particularly for genes for which functional analysis has been confounded by genetic redundancy. The approach uses zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) - chimeric proteins made up of a zinc finger array fused to the DNA cleavage domain of Fokl endonuclease.  Zinc finger arrays of high affinity and specificity can be engineered to recognize virtually any target gene.  Upon cleavage of the target DNA by the ZFN, the broken ends are repaired inefficiently, resulting in locus-specific mutations. In initial experiments, a model zinc finger nuclease and a reporter gene containing the cognate target site will be used to optimize methods for efficient recovery of heritable ZFN-induced mutations.  Next, ZFNs will be engineered to recognized native Arabidopsis loci, including those that give observable phenotypes when mutated. ZFNs will also be engineered for a locus where mutatations do not result in an observable phenotype.  To recover mutations at such a locus, robust DNA amplification and sequence-based detection methods will be employed.  Lastly, a tandem array of duplicate genes will be targeted.  Deletion of the array will be accomplished by engineering ZFNs to cleave within the outermost genes.  The frequency of recovering deletions and individual mutations will be determined to assess the relative efficiency of this approach.  In addition to Arabidopsis, this mutagenesis approach will also be valuable for plant species such as rice and maize, where genome sequencing projects are ongoing and tandem genes are abundant. Moreover, the ability to generate and regulate specific chromosomal double-strand breaks will facilitate studies of chromosome structure and DNA repair mechanisms in plants. The URL for the web site where protocols as well as results of gene knock-out studies can be accessed is http://www.beckmancenter.umn.edu/html/2010.html.  Understanding the function of plant genes is critical if plants are to be fully harnessed to meet the world's burgeoning need for fuel, feed and industrial raw materials.  Although significant progress has been made in discerning plant gene function, existing approaches have inherent limitations, particularly with respect to ascribing function to redundant or duplicated genes.  The goal of this project is to implement an efficient targeted mutagenesis approach to overcome these limitations.  This project will train undergraduate interns and graduate students for work in plant molecular biology.  Students from underrepresented groups will be recruited to the project through programs designed to enhance minority participation in science.

40,"Proposal #: CNS 08-21727PI(s):  Mellor-Crummey, John  Clementi, Cecilia; Nakhleh, Luay; Nordlander, Peter A.; Tezduyar, Tayfun E..Institution: Rice University   Houston, TX 80309-0572Title:    MRI/Acq.: Acq. of Cyberinfrastructure for Computational Research (CCR)Project Proposed:This project, acquiring instrumentation and operating a computational cluster for research (CCR), enables code development, medium scale computation, preparation of scalable codes for execution on national-scale resources, post-processing and visualization of results from remote supercomputers, and research training. Projects range from development of enabling technologies, such as programming models and performance analysis tools for parallel systems, to computational science and engineering research that includes techniques for automated verification of complex hardware and software designs, data mining of multiple whole genomes, studying large-scale ecological dynamics, determining the properties of nanophotonic structures through simulation, simulating protein dynamics to study flexibility and function, modeling transport properties in biophysical systems, and understanding fluid structure interactions in physiological systems and engineering designs. The increase in the number of CPU hours available for shared research computing contributes to support the explosive growth of computational research. Hence, more tightly coupled computing can be supported at a higher scale; a centralized computing facility can be scheduled for higher utilization; a single system can be operated and administered (rather than collections of cluster for individual research groups, and may effectively on-ramp national resources. Operating this modest-size computational cluster locally complements the TeraGrid and accelerates research. In particular, higher bandwidth and lower latency to the desktop from a local system better supports code development using interactive tools with graphical user interfaces (e.g., for debugging, performance, and scalability analysis, and data visualization) while preparing codes for execution on national-scale resources. Indeed, computation is an indispensable tool for scientific inquiry and complements traditional approaches of theory and experimentation.Broader Impacts:CCR enhances the graduate research and training of hundreds of students and post-doctoral fellows in science and engineering. It provides educational experience for undergraduate and graduate students through its use in courses that integrate high performance computing and computational problem solving. Furthermore, a boot-camp will familiarize students with high performance computing and teach computational problem solving skills. The instrument also contributes to recruiting and serves as an educational tool in the Alliance for the Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP), a successful program in attracting members from underrepresented groups into higher education, thus broadening their educational experience.

41,"The goals of this project are to understand how certain types of bacteria are capable of supplying themselves with nitrogen fertilizer, which is required for the growth of all organisms. The project will determine at the cellular and molecular level, how these bacteria, called cyanobacteria, produce the cells and enzymes that  fix  nitrogen from the air to produce compounds that can enter cell metabolism. Cyanobacteria are green in color and obtain energy from sunlight with photosynthesis similarly to plants. Like algae, cyanobacteria are important primary producers, which are food for other organisms, in many environments, especially the oceans, and they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which reduces effects of global warming. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria provide biologically available nitrogen in natural environments and are used as nitrogen fertilizer for rice cultivation in some parts of the world. Recently, there has been enormous interest in using cyanobacteria and algae to capture energy from sunlight to produce biomass, biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol, and hydrogen gas. This project will use the well-established model organism Anabaena to determine how specialized cells called heterocysts produce the enzymes required for nitrogen fixation. The project will use methods of genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry to study these processes. This project is expected to reveal new mechanisms of genetic regulation and gene expression in this large and important group of microorganisms. Understanding the mechanisms that control nitrogen-fixation genes will enhance our knowledge of basic microbial biology, genetics, and metabolism, and will provide knowledge that can be applied to industrial carbon capture and biofuel production. During the course of this project, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students will receive training in state-of-the-art research methods. The research will also produce materials and methods that will be useful to other researchers in both academia and industry, and the long-term goals of this project will benefit society by providing basic knowledge related to natural ecosystems, agriculture, global warming, and biofuels.

43,"Computational methods to predict protein structure  from sequence are becoming increasingly important and powerful, particularly in light of structural and functional annotation of genomic data.  To improve the performance of computational algorithms, this project has three specific aims: (1) Development of an orientation-dependent statistical potential based on side-chain packing; (2) Development of a fast and accurate method for generating side-chain rotamer conformations; and  (3) Development of structure profile for alignment and template identification of remote targets.  Currently, the development of effective potential functions for side-chain modeling is still a challenging problem in the field.  The new statistical potential function and its applications open a new path to improving the modeling of side-chains.  Such a capability is vitally important for high-accuracy refinement of predicted structures, which is the most difficult step in structure prediction for the last few decades.  As a faculty member for the last seven years at both Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University,  the PI bears enormous educational responsibility and shares high enthusiasm for developing programs to expose underprivileged and minority students to modern computational techniques and tools of structural biology.  Being in Houston, one of the largest populations of such students in the United States and having the inter-institutional appointment at both Baylor and Rice are two important factors that have dramatically enabled  the PI to fulfill this important duty.

Rather than relying primarily on elicited data ( How do you say X in Kibena? ), this project will utilize larger texts and conversations in an effort to study Kibena in its most natural form. Therefore one of the outputs of this project will be the compilation of a corpus of audio and video recordings. Materials in the corpus will be transcribed, with translations provided in both English and Kiswahili (the national language of Tanzania), in order to facilitate access by other researchers interested in the language.The Bena people are interested in increasing the profile and use of Kibena, particularly with regard to written materials. The Committee for Promoting Bena Culture (PBC, formerly Kibena Language Committee) has requested the production of a  grammar book  of their language which they plan to use to aid in the production of written materials. This project includes the production of a simplified grammar, which will be written in Kiswahili in order to facilitate access by adult Kibena speakers. This grammar will be aimed at facilitating the production of written materials. In addition, this project provides for the production of a book of stories (histories, folk tales, etc.). This book will be aimed at speakers with basic functional literacy. Copies of all materials resulting from this project will be provided to the PBC and efforts will be made to ensure the usability of project materials for the production of Kibena language materials.

50,"2010 Arabidopsis/AFGN Collaborative Project:  An exemplary calcium signaling network in plant abiotic stress responses US-PI: Sheng Luan, University of California at Berkeley, USAGerman-PI: Jorg Kudla, Universitat Munster, GermanyThe calcineurin B-like calcium sensors (CBLs) and their interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), collectively named CBL-CIPK network.  URL where the public can get information on the project: http://www.uni-muenster.de/Biologie.Botanik/agkudla/kudla.htmlDefinition of Determining the Function: Recent studies by the investigators uncovered a new family of Ca2+ sensors (CBLs) that target a family of protein kinases (CIPKs), establishing a novel paradigm for Ca2+ signaling in plants. The Luan-Kudla collaborative research supported by NSF and DFG has established an extensive CBL-CIPK network that functions in a number of signaling pathways including responses to abiotic stress, nutrient sensing, and ABA responses. This  research seeks to perform a systems analysis of the mechanisms and functions of CBL-CIPK interaction network and its contribution to the integration and decoding of various calcium signals during abiotic stress responses.The functional analysis results will be shared through the webpage above and publications as the results come along.  Significance: Almost all signal transduction processes in plants involve Ca2+ that serves as a vital second messenger. Understanding how Ca2+ mediates the cellular responses triggered by myriad environmental signals is one of the most important goals for plant biologists in years to come. Besides shedding light on the molecular basis for plant tolerance to environmental stress factors, this research will produce insights into calcium signaling mechanisms with relevance for all eukaryotes, provide novel tools for protein-protein interaction, mutant analyses, and cell biology research in plant biology.  Broader Impact: In addition to contributing to the body of fundamental science, this research will impact society as well as education. The findings made in this research can be applied to crop improvement via ongoing multi-national collaborations in the Luan laboratory. This research is designed to improve the nutrient uptake and stress tolerance of crop plants especially rice that serves as a model for cereals. The research will have an additional effect on undergraduate and graduate education through major courses the PI teaches at Berkeley and through independent research programs in PI's laboratory. The NSF project will also enhance ongoing efforts focused on local high schools to encourage minority students to obtain a higher education and enter biology. Furthermore, the US-Germany collaboration will provide a critical platform for training students and postdocs in international collaboration, a crucial component of education in today's global village atmosphere.

53,"The consumption and production of rice is an integral part of Chinese society, politics, and economy.  In an effort to be self-sufficient in grain production through modern technology, the Chinese government has invested significantly in using hybrid rice and developing biotechnology to feed the people through scientific advances in rice production.  In recent years, urban consumers are rejecting this mass-produced rice in favor of higher-quality rice, such as japonica varieties grown in China's northeast.  At the same time, the state discourse of suzhi (quality) promotes a model citizen subjectivity meant to counter the Mao era's emphasis on material mass-production and population quantity.  This doctoral dissertation project will identify how the Chinese state discourse regarding  quality  people affects the production and consumption of rice in contemporary society.  The following questions will be addressed:  (1) How do the Chinese state and farmers negotiate the need for high-quantity mass production of rice with urban consumer demand for high-quality rice?  (2) In what ways does japonica rice represent  quality  for both urban consumers and rural producers?  A case study of japonica rice from China's northeast will demonstrate the ways that this particular rice is considered to be  high quality.   The doctoral candidate will conduct interviews with Chinese rice scientists and agricultural policy makers, surveys with urban consumers in Beijing, and an in-depth ethnographic exploration of japonica rice production, distribution, and consumption in the northeast region of China.  The integration of findings from these activities will reveal the rising power of consumption as state policy has shifted to reflect the role of consumers.  As the Chinese state discourse of  quality  expands into the realm of agricultural policies, this project will provide an appropriate lens to analyze the connection across rural-urban social divides.This dissertation research project will enhance basic understanding regarding how Chinese state discursive practices have influenced changes in grain production and consumption practices.  Moreover, it will provide insight into the growing influence that consumers have in guiding agricultural production in China's new market economy.  In addition to increasing basic understanding of domestic social and environmental changes in China, project results will relate to the global market for rice and food trade.  This will have special relevance because the U.S. Department of Agriculture and California rice growers increasingly are concerned about Chinese japonica rice exports to Asia slowing their own market.  The project may also shed new light on broader ranging issues, such as the safety of food imports from China to the U.S.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.

54,"Gustavo Scuseria of Rice University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research to develop more accurate and efficient approximations in density functional theory (DFT).  The work is expected to significantly enhance DFT's applicability to ground and excited electronic states of both molecules and solids. The projects being pursued involve concepts such as local hybrids and local range separation. The new functionals being developed in the Scuseria group are being applied to carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons, both of which are promising materials for nanotechnology applications.Computational quantum chemistry has provided essential tools for predicting chemical properties and interpreting new chemical phenomena. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the most widely used method in quantum chemistry. The strongest appeal of DFT is that it delivers usefully accurate predictions at a computational cost much lower than other techniques such as correlated wavefunction methods. Application of linear scaling techniques can make DFT affordable even for very large systems (both molecules and solids).  This makes DFT the only method available for first-principles prediction of quantum effects such as conductance in these systems. While DFT is formally exact, in practice it requires approximating a large component of the total energy: the exchange-correlation interaction. DFT's accuracy, and ultimate usefulness, is limited by the quality of approximations to the exact exchange-correlation functional. Existing approximate functionals are reasonably accurate, but lose their edge over modern wavefunction methods for many properties. The PI's research group has been active in the development of novel exchange-correlation functionals for the last several years. Many of the functionals developed in his group (e.g., VSXC,TPSS, HSE) are widely used in academia, national laboratories, and industry. The current work is expected to have an equally broad impact and to contribute to the training of students at all levels.

55,"The goal of this work is to determine the fundamental dynamics of key organic nitrate-forming reactions and develop predictive models of this chemistry.  It is hypothesized that the master equation (ME) approach for this class of reactions suffers from a failure of Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory because of slow intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR).  Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations will be used to assess the importance of slow IVR in the reaction system consisting of peroxy radicals (RO2) with nitric oxide (NO) to form alkoxy radicals (RO) or alkyl nitrates (RONO2).  When feasible, analytical potential energy surfaces will be constructed; direct dynamics with a parameterized semiempirical quantum theory like NDDO-SRP (neglect of diatomic differential overlap - specific reaction parameters) will also be used to calculate the potential and its gradients.  Both approaches will be evaluated using high level electronic structure calculations.  Temperature and pressure-dependent yields of nitrates from nitrate radical (NO3) + alkene reactions of primary and secondary alkenes as a function of carbon chain length will also be calculated.The results will enable other researchers to develop accurate atmospheric chemistry models to predict atmospheric nitrate yields as a function of temperature, pressure, and the identity of the RO2 radical or alkene.  All parameterizations, ME source codes, and models will be made freely available on the internet.  Insights into non-RRKM kinetics will be applicable to the study of other non-equilibrium systems, such as in combustion.  Students and postdoctoral research associates will learn about chemical kinetics theory, QCT dynamics, and quantum chemistry methods in the context of atmospheric chemistry.

56,"In many areas such as signal processing, control, statistics, learning, inverse problems, and management,  large  data sets are often processed to find  small  solutions, those depending ultimately upon a small number of factors. Since these solutions tend to be sparse in a way, it is possible for methods that pick out the sparse solutions to find them from a reduced number of indirect measurements compared to what are usually considered necessary. This is the emerging technology of compressed sensing (CS). In this research, the PI proposes to study a broad range of issues and techniques to advance CS. His proposed reseach includes the introduction of new methodolgies for exploiting solution sparsity to accelerate CS computation, the development of algorithms that utilize operations requiring low storage and maintain robustness to noise and errors in data, and the discovery of efficient methods for minimizing the l1-norms of wide classes of functions such as first and higher-order differences. This project will include an integrated educational program involving a new course, one Ph.D. student, and the participation in the Rice-Houston AGEP program in producing competitive women and minority graduate students.The new emerging technology of  compressed sensing  is a complement to traditional data compression. While the traditional technology encodes digital data using fewer bits in order to save storage and transmission time, the new technology can significantly reduce the time, energy, and cost associated with the acquisition of digital data. This is achieved by acquiring digit information of an object of interest from a reduced number of obervations than what is usually necessary. For example, the life of an aeriel such as a space telescope can be greatly extended due to a lower sampling rate (and thus a lower power demand). Hyperspectral and infrared imaging devices can produce the same images with smaller sensors, or if with the same sensors, images at higher resolution. As such, the new technology can lead to breakthroughs for applications where the bottleneck lies in the high cost of data acquisition.

57,"Mathematical and computational models will be used to study populations hierarchically segregated into groups referred to as  households .  These households may represent patches within an agricultural field, fields within a landscape, dorms within a school, schools within a city, cities within a region, or even subnetworks within larger computer networks.  Population models and epidemiological models will be explored within this framework, complementing other work with lattice-structured populations.  In the models, interactions within a household occur much more often than interactions between different households.  Primary goals of the models are to better understand how and why spatially targeted and/or clustered treatments affect dynamics of infections, for example varying the rates of pesticide application to crop fields based on the levels of insect infestations among those fields.  Factors such as spatially varying resistance (both long-term, due to e.g. mosaic planting of different crops in different fields; and short-term, e.g. as a result of pesticides) will be included in the models.  Another application will be better understanding the spread of malicious computer software ( worms ) using biological dispersal strategies in clustered heterogeneous computer networks.Entomologists and other researchers will cooperate with the principal investigator and his students to develop applications of the project such as controlling maggot flies in commercial blueberry fields in Maine, planthoppers in rice fields in China, and other agricultural crop pests.  Interdisciplinary courses on modeling and simulation will incorporate various topics from the project.  Undergraduate research training will be a significant part of the work, including participation in a summer research program primarily aimed at underrepresented minority groups.

58,"AbstractThe research objective of this award is to take a systematic and integral approach to study interfaces in SWNT reinforced nanocomposites, using combinations of Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based testing platforms, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The proposed research involves the following tasks, (1) Development of novel, versatile and reliable MEMS based testing platforms to perform nanotube pull-out experiments for quantitative characterization of interfacial interaction between (a) SWNT and epoxy matrix, (b) SWNT and PDMS matrix, (c) SWNT and Au matrix; (2) Quantitative AFM study in both normal and lateral mode to provide direct and accurate assessment of adhesion and friction forces between the above mentioned reinforcement/matrix interfaces, in particular after the occurrence of de-bonding events; (3) Investigation of modified SWNT/matrix interfaces by different sidewall chemical functionalization methods using both the MEMS testing platform and AFM; (4) Theory and MD simulation of the key interfacial structures and relaxation mechanisms between SWNT reinforcement and matrix in correlation with observations from the experiments. If successful, the results of this research will be a vital step towards fundamental understanding of the physical nature of interfacial behaviors in nanocomposites, which in turn will enable the design of synthetic nanocomposites for improved mechanical performance. Graduate students and under-represented undergraduates will be recruited to work on this cutting-edge research, and will be given opportunities to present their results at research conferences and to local communities. Founded by the PI, the newly established Paslay Nanoscale Science and Engineering Educational Lab at Rice University will serve as a platform for outreach activities involving high school students and science teachers in greater Houston area, and introduce the findings from this research to the general public. In addition, the insights gained through this research will be effectively disseminated to students affiliate with the Clarkson Aerospace Minority Leader Research and Education Program, which is one of the minority outreach program here at Rice, focusing on Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions. abstracting; Adhesions; Area; Atomic Force Microscopy; Award; base; Behavior; Carbon Nanotubes; Chemicals; Communities; design; Development; Education; Engineering; Event; Friction; General Population; graduate student; high school; Historically Black Colleges and Universities; improved; insight; Institution; interfacial; Investigation; Lateral; Mechanics; Methods; Minority; Minority Outreach Program; molecular dynamics; nanocomposite; nanomechanical; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; Nature; novel; outreach; Performance; programs; Psychological reinforcement; Recruitment Activity; Relaxation; Research; research study; Rice; Science; single walled carbon nanotube; Structure; Students; symposium; System; teacher; Testing; theories; Universities; WorkNANOMECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS OF INTERFACES IN CARBON NANOTUBE REINFORCED NANOCOMPOSITES",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
59,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential plant hormones that regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development and require two receptor kinases, Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1) and BRI1-Associated Receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1), for hormone perception and signal transduction. The principal investigators identified specific BR-dependent phosphorylation sites of Arabidopsis BRI1 and BAK1 in planta and isolated a putative cytoplasmic substrate of BRI1 with homology to the mammalian TGF-beta receptor interacting protein (TRIP-1). TRIP-1 (also known as eIF3i) is a dual function protein that regulates TGF-beta signaling in mammals and also plays a critical role in the eIF3 protein translation initiation complex in animals, yeast and plants. Arabidopsis BRI1 interacts with TRIP-1 in planta and phosphorylates TRIP-1 on three specific residues in vitro. Initiation is the rate-limiting step in eukaryotic protein translation and is often regulated by phosphorylation of specific initiation factor subunits in response to various signals. A proteomic screen for novel BRI1 and BAK1 interactors identified an additional four eIF subunits; eIF2B, eIF3g, eIF4A and eIF5, as putative kinase domain substrates for BRI1 and/or BAK1. Taken together, the preliminary evidence suggests that BR-dependent phosphorylation of TRIP-1 (and other eIF subunits) by BRI1 may affect initiation factor activity and/or assembly and thus impact the global cellular phenomenon of protein translation, providing a novel mechanism for BR regulation of plant growth. The research will examine the intersection of BR signal transduction and protein translation initiation by focusing on three objectives. Objective 1. Characterization of Arabidopsis TRIP-1 in vivo phosphorylation sites by a variety of mass spectrometry approaches and analysis of their functional significance with respect to BR signaling and eIF3 activity. Objective 2. Detailed in vivo and in vitro characterization of the putative interaction of eIF3g and eIF5 with BRI1 and BAK1. Objective 3.Generation of an in vivo phosphorylation site database of multiple eIF subunits followed by quantitative studies of BR-dependent phosphorylation in these proteins using label-free mass spectrometry methodologies.Intellectual merit: A great deal is known about genomic effects of BR signaling and BR regulated gene expression, but little is known about non-genomic pathways through which BRs might regulate cellular physiology directly, e.g. by phosphorylating cytoplasmic proteins such as translation initiation factor subunits. Identification of specific in vivo phosphorylation sites in eIF subunits coupled with their functional characterization will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating protein translation in plants.Broader impacts: The proposed research will provide excellent training in biochemistry, molecular biology and mass spectrometry at all levels, including postdoctoral scientists, graduate and undergraduate students and high school student summer interns. A database of eIF phosphorylation sites will be made publicly available and vector constructs and transgenic plants useful to the research community will be distributed via the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. BRs are now firmly established as essential regulators of plant growth and development affecting a broad spectrum of developmental processes. The identification of BR biosynthetic and insensitive mutants in tomato, rice, barley and pea, clearly extends the importance of these compounds from the experimental plant Arabidopsis thaliana to crop plants and recent field experiments have shown slight alterations in rice BRI1 expression can alter rice yields by up to 30%. Understanding the molecular details of BR signal transduction can thus have practical application in regulating the growth of agricultural plants.

61,"Peroxisomes are cellular compartments that house a variety of processes. In plants, peroxisomal enzymes catalyze numerous critical metabolic reactions, including fatty acid breakdown, certain photosynthesis-related reactions, and metabolism of several hormones. A distinguishing and remarkable feature of peroxisomes is their ability to import folded and even multimeric cargo proteins. Most proteins necessary for building peroxisomes (peroxins) are dedicated to importing peroxisomal enzymes from the cytoplasm, where the proteins are synthesized. A broad outline has emerged that describes how proteins are imported into animal, fungal, and plant peroxisomes. Whereas some elements of peroxisome biogenesis appear to be universal, other components display surprising variability. It is therefore critical to examine these import proteins in greater detail to define their roles in plants. This project will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of peroxisome protein import in plants by analyzing peroxin mutants in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana for peroxisome defective phenotypes, peroxisomal protein import, and receptor levels. Genetic and physical interactions among the peroxins will provide insight into how the peroxins work together. A genetic screen will provide a means to discover peroxins unique to plants or not yet discovered in other systems by taking advantage of, without being limited by, what is known in other systems.

62,"Vertically integrated cross-disciplinary research groups (known as PFUGs, an acronym for  Postdoctoral, Faculty, Undergraduate, and Graduate Research Groups ) are now proud, shared emblems of the three departments (Computational and Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Mathematics) that partnered in the Rice VIGRE I project and will continue that partnership in VIGRE II. PFUGs have become a way of life for the departments? existing majors and graduate students and excellent avenues for engaging and recruiting a broad array of talent.  Under VIGRE II the three departments will sustain, expand, and leverage these successes as Rice itself enters a phase of rapid growth. Under VIGRE II every undergraduate major in any of the three departments will experience mathematical research. VIGRE II will extend the reach of PFUGs to departments and institutions at further distance from the traditional mathematical sciences departments. In addition, while the project will maintain many of its ongoing research programs, VIGRE II will also annually pursue a single new theme that not only engages all strata of all three mathematics departments but also draws in and significantly impacts a strategic area of application, such as the life sciences, finance, or information technology.  Finally, VIGRE II will exploit  Connexions  to improve radically the existing mechanisms for constructing and disseminating findings.  Connexions  is a Rice-based collection of tools to create modules that can be related to each other in multiple ways and that can be organized so as to produce books or courses or short documents or just browsed online. Students, with help from communication professionals, will learn to keep research logs that, with careful editing and design, could evolve into modules. These PFUGal variations will be folded into a narrative on  The Art of the PFUG  that will serve as a national model for vertical integration. acronyms; Area; Arts; base; Biological Sciences; Books; Collection; Communication; Communities; design; Emblem; experience; Faculty; graduate student; improved; Information Technology; Institution; Learning; Life; Mathematics; Modeling; Phase; programs; rapid growth; Recruitment Activity; Research; Rice; Science; statistics; Students; success; Talents; tool; VariantEMSW21-VIGRE: LEVERAGING THE STRENGTH AND EXTENDING THE REACH OF AN INTEGRATED MATHEMATICS COMMUNITY",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06

64,"CBET-0756166ChapmanMany modern applications of macromolecular fluids take advantage of their novel microstructure and phase behavior. The challenge in modeling nano-structured fluids lies in understanding the new physics that emerges from finite-size effects, varying dimensionality, surface forces and interplay of multiple length and time scales. The introduction of external surface forces and the competition between fluid substrate and fluid-fluid interactions lead to interesting surface driven phase changes not seen in bulk systems [9]. Intellectual Merit: The project focuses on the to development of a novel molecular theory for multi-scale modeling of complex fluid assemblies and to apply the theory to several critical problems in nano-structured media. The work builds on the PIs new density functional theory (DFT) that has shown an unprecedented combination of accuracy and simplicity in predicting the structure of inhomogeneous polyatomic mixtures [29,30]. Predictions of the DFT are in excellent agreement with molecular simulation results for phenomena such as polymer depletion, enhancement and surface induced segregation key elements in polymer-colloid systems and in coatings of polymer blends. Further, the DFT has similar simplicity and computational speed to an atomic density functional theory. We propose to incorporate multiple molecular association sites, chain stiffness, and hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces in the theory. The approach will be validated with molecular simulation results and compared with experiment for interfacial properties and structure of copolymer, surfactant, and tethered polymer systems. Broader Impact: The immense potential of the DFT has led to an ongoing collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) to incorporate our DFT within their massively parallel DFT solver package ? TRAMONTO. With its existing capabilities, TRAMONTO can address life-scale systems such as colloids and electrolytes in a range of 2D/3D geometries. Integrating the PIs polyatomic DFT within this platform dramatically expands the potential scope of the package to such systems as self-assembly in polymer-colloid polymer-nanoparticle systems, block copolymer films and blends, surfactant or lipid systems exhibiting micellar or bilayer structures, and polyelectrolytes. When the final version is released to the public, it is anticipated that these computational tools will have high impact on nanoscience and design of nanosystems by allowing exhaustive analysis of design or phase space (needed for design of experiments) at a moderate expense. Dow Chemical has significant interest in applying the theory to model microstructure and interfacial properties of copolymer solutions, blends, and surfactants. Letters of collaboration from Sandia and Dow are attached with direct and in-kind funding from Dow. Of further impact will be education of a graduate student, post-doc, and undergraduate students participating in the project. These students will make presentations to companies that have participated in our Consortium on Complex Fluids and present research results at international conferences. The graduate student benefited from a summer internship offered by Dow. In addition to incorporating new theory in courses at Rice, the project  will develop an educational module (book chapter) of the theory for web distribution using the internationally recognized Connexions environment (cnx.rice.edu).

65,"0802014RothenbergThe International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Sarah Rothenberg to work with Dr. Xinbin Feng at State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry in Guiyang, China.Guizhou Province, located in southwestern China, is highly contaminated with mercury (Hg) due to historical mining of cinnabar, industrial runoff, artisinal zinc smelting, incineration of municipal wastes, and reliance on coal-burning power plants to fuel economic growth and heat residential homes.  Hg runoff and residues have contaminated the air, water, soil, as well as agricultural products, including rice.  Even though most human exposure to Hg occurs through the consumption of fish, Hg exposure may also occur through the ingestion of rice, and this exposure pathway may be important in countries where rice is a staple.  Like wetlands, rice paddies are potential hot spots for the conversion of inorganic Hg to toxic mono-methylmercury (MMHg).  The PI is conducting a study to determine under which hydrologic and biogeochemical regimes highest MMHg concentrations occur in rice paddies, which may be used to develop mitigation strategies.  There are two research components.  (1) The PI is characterizing sulfur cycling and Hg methylation within irrigation water, anoxic pore water and sediments within at least four rice paddies, half using traditional methods of irrigation and half using water saving methods.  (2) The PI is also deploying a series of embedded sensor networks within the same four rice paddies in the early spring and in the late summer to coincide with the start and end of the rice growing season.  Time series sensor measurements of oxygen redox potential and pH will be correlated with pore water MMHG levels to determine under which conditions MMHg production is highest.  This study will answer the following questions: Are rice paddies hot spots for Hg methylation?  How does sulfur cycling in the surface soil, anoxic bulk soil, and rhizosphere affect Hg methylation?  Are there differences between flooded rice paddies and rice paddies that employ water-saving methods?  How do temporal/seasonal changes in pore water oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and pH affect Hg speciation?This project serves as a bridge between US and Chinese researchers, and is also collaborative, bringing together environmental scientists, engineers and computer scientists to focus on an critical environmental problem.

66,"The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER Program project is develop concepts that go beyond standard methods for infrastructure system analysis.  For instance, traditional reliability assessment of complex systems is limited to connectivity analysis, whereas this research will focus on novel flow-based reliability methods to capture interdependent flow congestion and cascading failure dynamics.  To accomplish system-level analyses and performance forecasting of intelligent networks, the PI will introduce concepts of instantaneous reliability that rely on increased availability of infrastructure state data from real-time monitoring devices.  Instantaneous reliability will be quantified by inferring at every point in time the probability distributions of the parameters that govern infrastructure performance (e.g., failure rates, restoration times, coupling strengths, hazard rates, and demand fluctuations), as well as identifying the type and locations of network components that are more likely to drive interacting infrastructures into unreliable states.  Insights from these spatio-temporal analyses will enable the development of functionality-driven design and risk mitigation guidelines to continuously achieve uniform performance in geographically distributed systems.  The research and education components of this CAREER plan will advance the science of interacting networks, including power, water, gas, and telecommunication systems, and form the engineers that will manage aging utilities and deploy the envisioned intelligent systems of growing urban centers.Completion of the work will bring significant benefits to infrastructure system users, stakeholders, and students.  Service reliability forecasting will be possible with the instantaneous assessment tools that learn from current system states and past trends.  The new tools will facilitate network operation and emergency response by enabling anticipation of system failure and optimal dispatching of repair crews. Also, regulatory authorities will be able to adopt design guidelines that impose minimum interdependent reliability standards.  In addition, this project has strong educational ideas to nurture the next generation of civil engineers, and recruit women and minorities for designing and operating smart infrastructures.  By implementing a new learning paradigm for undergraduate/graduate students at Rice University, referred to as network-based knowledge, students will be exposed to a balanced combination of algorithmic computation and mathematics, which are considered the cornerstones of modern network science.

67,"Dr. David A. Himmelgreen, Dr. Nancy Romero Daza, and Ms. Noemi Danao, along with graduate students from the University of South Florida and staff from the Monteverde Institute, will undertake research on the impact that the ongoing transition from farming to tourism is having on the food habits and nutritional health of rural Costa Rican households.  As part of the new global economy, tourism provides for new economic opportunities and the development of infrastructure and services.  Yet with a de-emphasis on local food production, there is an increased reliance on imported foods which are more expensive and include processed energy-dense foods that are high in fat and refined sugar.  The primary research question is whether food consumption and nutritional health vary depending on the degree to which rural households rely on tourism for income.  The research will take place in two communities in the Monteverde region, where dairy farming and coffee farming are  being replaced by eco-tourism.  Two hundred households will be included. A quantitative and qualitative study will be conducted to examine the ways in which households combine economic strategies and  the impact that such activities have on dietary behaviors and nutritional health.  Additionally, a market assessment and interviews with food suppliers will be done to examine the seasonal availability and cost of fresh produce and staple foods such as rice, beans, and dairy products).  Researchers will employ surveys, focus groups, in-depth interviews, measures of food security, food frequency questionnaires, and physiological measures of nutritional health using anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis.This study contributes an anthropological perspective in which the bio-cultural dimensions of health are examined.  Using mixed methods, it will identify the biological consequences that globalization has on rural populations. The research will contribute understanding how social and cultural processes shape food-related behaviors. The research also will provide training opportunities for graduate students.

The REU program conducted by the Rice Quantum Institute (RQI) brings students from outside universities to Rice University for a ten-week interdisciplinary summer research program.  Each student works directly within the research group of a faculty mentor from science and engineering departments within RQI.  Each project is designed to be part of a long-range research program by the faculty mentor, but individual to the student and manageable within ten weeks.  The students are collectively exposed to different disciplines by contact with a variety of research groups in other labs, weekly seminars by Rice grad students and frequent scientific and social interactions (as well as joint housing) with the other REU students.  In mid-session, the students present brief computer presentations to each other and the PI of the context, goals, hurdles and long-range expected yield of their projects.  During the final week, written reports are turned in, exit interviews are performed, and, on the last day, students present their work at the RQI Colloquium.  This annual event, which assembles a large audience made up of REU students, of research groups and others from Rice, as well as interested outsiders from neighboring schools and industries, showcases research going on within the Institute.

69,"Intellectual Merit Eukaryotes (animals, plants and fungi), but not prokaryotes (bacteria), have intracellular membranes that allow these cells to compartmentalize specialized functions. One of the most abundant of these membrane networks is the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.  Within this network is a specialized region of sheet membrane, called the nuclear envelope, which physically sequesters the chromosomes from the cytoplasm.   In order for cells to divide, the chromosomes are duplicated and then during mitosis are pulled apart by the microtubule fibers of the mitotic spindle so that each daughter cell receives a full complement of genetic information.  In animal cells the nuclear envelope breaks down at mitosis, allowing the cytoplasmic spindle to contact and then pull the chromosomes apart. In contrast, during the closed mitosis of yeast, the nuclear envelope remains intact and the spindle forms inside of the nuclear envelope.  As it elongates to pull the chromosomes apart, the spindle pushes on the nuclear envelope changing its shape from spherical to oblong to dumbbell.  The mechanistic basis for these shape changes remains unknown.  However, with prior NSF support Dr. Sazer has identified and characterized fission yeast mutants in which nuclear size, shape or integrity are compromised.  In collaboration with a group of theoretical physicists her laboratory developed a mathematical model that describes the biophysics of the fission yeast nucleus.   These studies fundamentally changed our understanding of the physical properties of the nuclear envelope and their impact on nuclear division. In the project, the principal investigator will test the following hypotheses: 1) Large protein complexes, called spindle pole bodies, which anchor the ends of the spindle in the nuclear envelope, are required to prevent membrane rupture upon spindle elongation; 2) A large influx of new membrane must be added to the nuclear envelope during mitosis and this requires a structural change in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum; and 3) Two newly identified inner nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins influence nuclear structure and organization.  These studies will answer longstanding questions regarding differences in nuclear structure and function between fungal cells that undergo closed mitosis and animal cells that undergo open mitosis and will have more general applications for understanding how intracellular membrane organization and conformational changes regulate organelle-specific functions.Broader Impacts     Graduate students, Rice University undergraduate students and undergraduate participants in the summer SMART (Summer Medical and Research Training) program, which promotes the participation of underrepresented groups in science, will carry out the proposed studies.  The experimental approaches to be used in this project are particularly well suited to students, who quickly become adept at genetics, cell culture and microscopy and carry out independent projects. In recognition of their intellectual and experimental contributions, nearly 50 of the authors of papers published by the principal investigator were students. All lab members, including undergraduates, participate in lab meetings and journal clubs and present their work at both local and national meetings. The graduate students directly supervise the undergraduates thereby gaining invaluable teaching and managerial experience. The principal investigator has demonstrated a long-standing commitment to science education: as a graduate student she lectured in high school biology classes; as a post-doctoral fellow she conducted tutorials for students at Somerville College, the only women's college in the University of Oxford; and, as a faculty member, she mentors an ethnically diverse group of high school, undergraduate and graduate students including a woman who attended a historically black college and several Hispanic women. She is also co-director of the federally funded interdepartmental Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Program, participates in graduate curriculum development and has received teaching awards from the Graduate Student Council, the Dean of the Graduate School and the first year graduate student class.

70,"Proposal Number  0747431TITLE  CAREER: Multi-stage Programming for Object-Oriented Languages PI     Walid Taha, Rice UniversityOver the past decade, multi-stage programming (MSP) has emerged as a unifying approach that captures the disciplined essence program generation. Early work on MSP focused on purely functional languages. The goal of this proposal is to put what we know about MSP to work in the context of mainstream languages such as Java and C#. This will be achieved by means of carefully designed, minimal extensions that provide an expressive, statically checked mechanism for effectively eliminating the interpretive overhead.The project will design an object-oriented language that provides statically checked support for the writing of program generators. The language, called The Java Program Mint (Mint) will support:    1. Staging constructs that are statically checked before expansion/generation,   2. Indexed types, to enable further optimizations that are particularly synergistic with staging, and   3. Disciplined, statically typed compile-time computation. The design of Mint will be evaluated by establishing formal safety and expressivity results, and the implementation will be evaluated by building demonstration applications. The novel features of Mint will have the most impact on applications that use reflection and that constitute domain-specific language (DSL) extensions, such as serializers, JavaBeans customization facilities, and  synchronization libraries. design; Discipline; Generations; Genus Mentha; Goals; indexing; Java; Language; Libraries; novel; programs; Rice; Safety; Staging; Time; Universities; Work; WritingCAREER: MULTI-STAGE PROGRAMMING FOR OBJECT-ORIENTED LANGUAGES",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.9934365699114172
71,"This project addresses fundamental questions in the study of representative democracy:  What impact, if any, does public opinion have on democratic governance? Do policymakers actually do what citizens want them to do? If public sentiment changes direction, will the actions of elected officials follow? A fundamental normative claim in favor of liberal democracy is that the recurrence of competitive elections promotes an ongoing connection between citizen preferences and government policy. In other words, electoral competition is designed to encourage governments to be responsive to the policy demands of the public throughout their time in office. Although scholars have shown enormous interest in this question, almost all their efforts thus far have been confined to examining responsiveness in the context of the United States Congress. This is unfortunate for a number of reasons. Most especially, the majority of established democracies in the world differ quite markedly from the United States in terms of their institutional structures and patterns of governance. Most democracies are parliamentary in design, which has the effect of giving policymaking power to the government (or cabinet), not the legislature. Further, most parliamentary democracies have more than two major parties. Policymaking typically requires the cooperation of several political parties, why may all simultaneously be attempting to appeal to very different groups of voters. At this point, comparative research is very limited in what it reveals about the connection between citizens and voters in these democracies.In this CAREER award, the principal investigator creates an integrated program of research and education to explore the question of whether policymaking in multiparty parliamentary democracies is responsive to citizen preferences throughout the government's term in office. The investigator proposes a theory of policy responsiveness that focuses on the electoral and office-seeking incentives of politicians in a multiparty setting. The central claim is that these incentives encourage government parties to tailor policy to the wishes of narrow constituencies, whose policy views may or may not accord with those of the majority of voters. To test the argument, the investigator, along with a team of student researchers from both the United States and Europe, will collect original legislative data from seven European democracies on all changes on tax and welfare policy that have been proposed and enacted over the past ten to twenty years. The project contains a strong educational component. It is expressly designed to help aspiring young scholars wishing to do comparative legislative research to overcome many of the practical difficulties associated with it. The investigator proposes three innovations in education and training. First, he proposes to take a number of students abroad, over the course of four summers, to perform archival legislative research. A novel feature of this activity is that these students will be working in collaboration with a team of students from universities in Europe who are also engaged in legislative research. The investigator also proposes to teach yearly practicum courses in legislative research to graduate and undergraduate students at Rice University in which they will be encouraged to use the data from the project, as it is being collected, in their own research. Finally, the investigator will host three annual week-long workshops that bring students at Rice University together with students from across the country and Europe who are working on questions in comparative legislative research.

72,"CCF - 0746850 PI name: KArtik MohanramTitle: CAREER: Design Optimization for Robustness to Single-Event EffectsInstitution: William Marsh Rice UniversityABSTRACT:Technology trends and economic factors are driving forces behind the widespread move to mainstream computing and communication systems based entirely on commodity hardware and operating systems. Yet, the premium that we as a society place on the reliability of such systems has increased commensurate with our reliance on them for the smooth operation of our lives. Soft errors resulting from single-event effects (SEEs) are an important-and possibly dominant-failure mode that impact the reliability of such mainstream commodity systems.This research will develop low-cost SEE-reliability-aware and SEE-reliability-driven design solutions based on optimization to maximize robustness to SEEs, commonly termed SEE-hardening. SEE-hardening is an attractive low-cost solution to increase reliability since it does not require any runtime support from either the hardware or the operating system. SEE-hardening can also be used to complement and reduce the overhead cost of traditional fault detection and tolerance techniques. The optimization algorithms for SEE-hardening resulting from this work provide seamless tradeoffs between SEE-hardness and area-delay-power, enabling cost-effective solutions commensurate with the criticality and reliability requirements over the lifetime of the target application. A major impact of this research is to enable ubiquitous low-cost highly reliable computing, by expanding its reach to domains that lack the financial resources to acquire custom solutions. Through academic and industry collaborations, this project will develop an integrated testbed and web-based resources to facilitate broad research in reliable system design, an area that is rapidly gaining in importance and interest.

73,"Rice 0739444This award supports a project to study the mode of formation and causes of glacial earthquakes.  The paradigm for glacial flow has been that glaciers flow in a viscous manner, with major changes in the force balance occurring on the decade timescale or longer. The recent discovery of a number of even shorter timescale events has challenged this paradigm. In 2003, it was discovered that Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica displays stick-slip behavior on the 10-30 minute timescale, with ice stream speed increasing by a factor of 30 from already high speeds. In the past year, the minimum timescale has been pushed shorter by recognition that a class of recently discovered 50-second-long, magnitude-5 earthquakes are closely associated with changes in the force balance near the calving fronts of large outlet glaciers in both Greenland and East Antarctica.  With no adequate theory existing to explain these relatively large earthquakes associated with outlet glaciers, we have begun to investigate the physical mechanisms that must be involved in allowing such a response in a system traditionally not thought capable of generating large variations in forces over timescales less than 100 seconds. The intellectual merit of the work is that large-amplitude, short-timescale variability of glaciers is an important mode of glacier dynamics that has not yet been understood from a first-principles physics perspective.  The proposed research addresses this gap in understanding, tying together knowledge from numerous disciplines including glaciology, seismology and fault rupture dynamics, laboratory rock physics, granular flow, fracture mechanics, and hydrogeology.  The broader impacts of the work are that there is societal as well as general scientific interest in the stability of the major ice sheets. However, without an understanding of the physical processes governing short time scale variability, it is unlikely that we will be able accurately predict the future of these ice sheets and their impact on sea level changes. The project will also contribute to the development and education of young scientists.

Alternative splicing has an important role in proteome diversity and gene regulation. Recent studies of large scale EST/cDNA datasets have revealed that the prevalence of alternative splicing in plants is much larger than expected, reaching around 30% of the genes, which is still significantly less than in human and mouse.  This is primarily due to the much smaller amount of cDNA/EST data that is available in plants. Therefore we are likely far from the true extent of alternative splicing in plants.  In human and mouse, several projects have made non-EST-based predictions of alternative splicing; none have been reported in plants to our knowledge.  To fill this gap, the PIs will develop computational tools to predict novel alternative splicing events and the cis-elements involved in regulated alternative splicing. Alternative splicing in plants has different characteristics than in animals, and the proposed computational and experimental work will help elucidate the mechanistic basis for these differences.  The initial focus will be in Arabidopsis, and the methods will be extended to rice and other plants for which genome and EST data are available.  The end-results of the proposed research will be the creation of a web-accessible database of predicted and validated alternative splicing events and cis-elements; the software developed during the course of this project will be made available for researchers interested in predicting alternative splicing in other plant species.

75,"The insect superfamily Cercopoidea (commonly called spittlebugs) is a group of plant-feeding insects found ubiquitously in most terrestrial ecosystems.  Worldwide, spittlebugs inflict heavy economic damage on grass crops such as sugar cane, corn, rice, and improved pasture grasses, causing up to 70% reduction in agricultural yields in infested areas.  Despite this importance, the evolutionary history of this insect group is virtually unknown.  This project represents a large-scale investigation into the evolution of spittlebugs using both traditional comparative morphological methods and modern DNA sequencing technology.  The results of this project will include a reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among the major lineages of spittlebugs, interpretations of observed patterns of worldwide spittlebug geographical distribution and hostplant affiliations, and improved, internet-accessible tools for spittlebug identification.The understanding of spittlebug evolution generated by this research will be of particular importance to the control of several known crop pests, as well as for the control of future outbreaks of novel spittlebug pests.  This work will provide a framework for integrating the considerable number of scientific studies that have been conducted on the biology and ecology of individual spittlebug species.  The identification tools to be developed will be of considerable value to scientists studying these insects, as well as workers in agriculture environments affected by these insects.  Additionally, the cutting-edge evolutionary analyses carried out through this research will serve as a model for similar studies on other plant and animal groups.  This project will provide training for several students at virtually all academic levels, adding to the next generation of experts in systematic entomology.

76,"Prudence M. Rice and a team of American and Guatemalan archaeologists will examine processes of societal survival and regeneration through the famous Classic southern lowland Maya civilizational  collapse.  Investigations focus on the Great Ballcourt at the site of Nixtun-Ch'ich', on the western edge of Lake Peten Itza, Peten, Guatemala, which thrived from the late Early Preclassic (ca. 1000-800 B.C.) into the Postclassic and historic period (early 18th century).   Societal survival through collapse depends on many factors, one being mechanisms that enhance socio-political integration and group solidarity. In Mesoamerica, the ballgame is one such mechanism; with deep mythological significance, its earliest formal court of play dates to 1400 B.C. Nixtun-Ch'ich's Great Ballcourt architectural complex boasts a playing alley >100 m long and 30 m wide, the largest ballcourt in the southern lowlands, and it resembles in size and plan the Great Ballcourt at Chich'en Itza (to the north in Yucatan, Mexico). Nixtun-Ch'ich's ballcourt is hypothesized to have been a key setting for public rituals of integration, accompanied by displays of competition and feasting. It is proposed that these, together with yet-unknown politico-economic ties to Chich'en Itza in the north, furthered the site's survival during the Maya  collapse.    Project objectives include: (1) dating the construction of Nixtun Ch'ich's Great Ballcourt complex; (2) examining the complex's use in public ritual through evidence of feasting; and (3) investigating relations with Chich'en Itza's ballcourt complex through architectural and ceramic comparisons. These objectives will be achieved through a clearing and excavation strategy that involves: (1) determining the exact dimensions of the ballcourt playing alley; (2) shallow transverse trenching across one of the ballcourt's structures; (3) deep test-pitting to investigate construction history; (4) identifying archaeological deposits (middens) behind (exterior to) the court, as evidence of feasting; and (5) testing ancillary structures for evidence of superstructural remains comparable to those at Chich'en Itza.   The intellectual merit of the project lies in answering questions about why some societies collapse and others continue, and what conditions result in irreversible declines while others permit continuity or regeneration. In studying one large Maya center that forestalled decline while others succumbed to  collapse,  seeds of continuity can be examined through the integrative mechanism of public ritual and feasting associated with the ballgame. Relations with Chich'en Itza, a large, distant site with a similar ballcourt complex, will also be explored.    This research contributes to general questions of societal collapse and regeneration, deepening understanding of the role of public ritual as a socio-political integrative mechanism. It provides a better understanding of the complex mosaic of the southern lowland Classic Maya  collapse  and the role of the Mesoamerican ballgame. The project contributes to the history of the Itza Maya, whose descendants still reside on the shores of Lake Peten Itza, and returns to them their Classic-period history of survival through collapse.  In addition, Guatemalan students will be trained in archaeological field and lab techniques and the results of the work will incorporated into a local museum that is focused on the archaeological history of the region.

77,"Individuals who are severely paralyzed as a result of spinal cord injuries, stroke, cerebral palsy, etc generally find it extremely difficult to carry out everyday tasks without continuous help.  In this research, the PI will develop a new assistive technology to enable individuals who are severely paralyzed to convey their intentions to their environment by accessing a portable computer or personal digital assistant.  The PI's approach is based on the observation that the tongue and mouth occupy an amount of sensory and motor cortex in the human brain rivaling that of the fingers and the hand.  As a consequence, the tongue and mouth are inherently capable of sophisticated motor control and manipulation tasks with many degrees of freedom.  The tongue is connected to the brain via the hypoglossal nerve, which generally escapes severe damage in spinal cord injuries.  Tongue muscle is similar to heart muscle, in that it does not fatigue easily.  Furthermore, the tongue is not influenced by the position of the rest of the body, which can be adjusted for maximum user comfort.  These advantages, coupled with the accessibility of tongue movements without penetrating the skin, suggest that the tongue might be employed as an excellent intermediate connection to the brain to establish a noninvasive brain-computer interface.  The PI will explore this possibility in the current project within the context of a new device called the Tongue Drive System (TDS).  TDS consists of an array of magnetic sensors located either inside the mouth (e.g., attached to the outer surfaces of the teeth via an orthodontic brace) or outside of it near the user's cheeks (e.g., mounted on a headset similar to head-worn microphones).  The sensor array measures the magnetic field of a small permanent magnetic tracer, the size of a grain of rice, which is attached to the tongue by means of tissue adhesives, implantation, piercing, or clipping.  Sensor signals are transmitted wirelessly to the external PC/PDA, where the data are processed to determine in real time the coordinates, orientation, and relative motion of the magnet with respect to the array of sensors.  This information is then used to control the movements of a cursor on the PC/PDA screen and to perform all other functions that an able-bodied individual can do with a mouse computer input device.  The PC/PDA will have WiFi or Bluetooth connections to a number of other devices, including a desktop computer and powered wheelchair, in the user's environment.Broader Impacts:  This research will help the most severely disabled individuals, particularlyquadriplegics, to lead more active, self-supportive, satisfying, and productive lives.  Paralysis is considered to be one of the most expensive types of disabilities.  Solutions such as the TDS will help reduce healthcare and assisted-living costs, increase the employability of people with disabilities, and allow users to participate more fully in society while relieving the burden on family members and caregivers.

78,"Engineering - Electrical (55)The project is exploring the use of concepts from cognitive load theory to develop educational materials and teaching strategies that focus on providing problems appropriate to a student's prior knowledge so that the material is more likely stored in long-term memory for use in future situations.  Results show that an overloaded working memory leads to students who can solve the problems they are working on, but who do not  store the material in long-term memory for use later.  Part of this overload comes from the material itself; the other part comes from instruction designs that lead to increased mental effort and no schema acquisition and construction.   To provide a proof-of-concept for this approach, materials are being developed for a course in electric circuit analysis. The goal of this instructional change is to improve a student's ability to solve complex, ill-defined problems. This program is developing three different set of materials: a rating scale for electric circuit problems using a community of experts, a set of completion problems which guide students in forming appropriate schema for long term memory storage, and a set of advanced problems which measure a student's ability to apply course material in novel situations. Evaluation efforts, conducted with the help of an outside evaluator, are measuring changes in students' ability to solve both standard and novel problems by scoring student work with standard rubrics.  Project materials and results are being disseminated through presentation and publication in the engineering education outlets and by posting material on the instructor's website and on special interest websites (Connections at Rice University and Problem-Based Learning Clearinghouse at University of Delaware).   The broader impacts include the dissemination of the material and the potential for adapting this approach to other engineering and science course.

79,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a process to convert renewable agricultural byproducts to solar grade silicon metal in an energy efficient and environmentally friendly manner. The hulls of rice and many other grain plants are rich in silica derived from the soil in which they are grown. This silica can be extracted in a highly purified form from rice hull ash to produce useful specialty chemicals. It can also be extracted to provide a basic feedstock for the production of solar grade silicon for the production of photovoltaic cells. This process will bypass the capital and energy intensive methods, such as the Siemens process, which are currently in use.The broader impact/commercial potential from this technology could develop a process which will enable the production of high purity silicon directly from agricultural byproducts without the use of the current energy intensive methods such as the Siemens process. The process uses an abundant waste product as a renewable material source in an energy-efficient manner to achieve a valuable product at low cost and with minimal environmental impact. Current production of crystalline photovoltaic cells is limited by the bottleneck of poly-silicon production. This innovative new process will enable downstream PV plants to run at full capacity, unconstrained by shortages of raw material, thus allowing more rapid adoption of solar energy at lower cost per kWp. Furthermore, the proposed process will be better for the environment in that it is much less energy intensive and uses less toxic chemicals than existing methods.

Although critics have argued that these programs fail to live up to their expectations and could cause greater social or environmental harm, most climate change scientists agree action must be taken because anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) exacerbate global climate change and lead to serious economic, environmental and social harm worldwide. Moreover, some regions of the world will suffer greater hardship than others. The distribution of impacts across different geographic locations and the ability of populations living there to cope with them have parallels in the inequitable distribution of development&rsquo;s benefits and costs. Sub-Saharan Africa in particular will be placed at considerable risk as it consistently ranks lowest among the world&rsquo;s regions in terms of development indicators (World Bank 2007).This project was conceived as an endeavor to develop a replicable approach for securing carbon credits in order to sustain responsible biofuels programs that help rural communities in less developed countries (LDCs). Developed in collaboration with our Malagasy research partner, the USAID funded Ecoregional Initiatives program in Fianarantsoa (ERI), this project examined whether a &ldquo;multifunctional platform,&rdquo; using a simple engine running on jatropha oil to power a small electric generator, a rice dehuller and an oil press, can be run sustainably within the context of a rural Malagasy community. We also focused on strategies to expand the use carbon credit mechanisms in Africa by applying our analysis to the circumstances of the Fianarantsoa-C&ocirc;te Est (FCE) railway transport corridor in Madagascar. This project holds particular significance for the rural populations of LDCs who scientists predict will be hardest hit by global climate change and already teeter on the edge of economic instability, questionable land tenure and food insecurity. In order to answer our questions and better understand the lives and needs of our target population, we visited seven rural villages in southeast Madagascar. The two primary focus villages, Andemaka and Ambohilza, lie along the FCE corridor and have no direct access to regional roadways. Although focusing on Madagascar, our project aims to provide rural populations around the world with more options and choices on how to meet their needs while confronting the root causes of environmental and social catastrophe.

82,"DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The purpose of this training program is to train future scientists to design, implement, select, and evaluate health information technology (HIT) that increases the quality and safety of healthcare. We will achieve this goal by training scientists who can develop and apply human-centered methods and techniques to HIT, drawing from research and methods in human factors engineering, quality improvement, information sciences, and related areas. To prepare scientists to meet this challenge, trainees must intermingle two training experiences. The first gives a solid foundation in informatics, research design and evaluation, human-centered design, and quality improvement. The second offers trainees first-hand experience through research programs that give them the opportunity to put their didactic training to practice by working on HIT that increases safety and quality of care. The program will be managed through the W.M. Keck Center. Trainees may be enrolled at any of the following five Keck Center member universities participating in the proposal: The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, and The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Research opportunities are available at these universities and at several other Texas Medical Center institutions and Centers that have agreed to participate as research sites in the program. These include Memorial Hermann Health Care System, Memorial Hermann TIRR, and the VA Medical Center, among others.

83,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Healthy People 2010 establishes the national goal of eliminating participation disparities in employment between people with disabilities and the general population. Indeed, only about 52% of people with disabilities report being employed, while 82% of the general population report having a job (DHHS, 2001). While there are many factors that affect the employment rate of people with disabilities, health status appears to be one of them. In a longitudinal study of 264 consumers of VR services in ten states preliminary data show higher ratings of secondary conditions at baseline were associated with lower employment outcomes at the 6-month follow-up measure (F = 8.448, p = .00). Further, results from a logistic regression (n=164) show that reported secondary conditions at baseline predict employment outcomes at 6-months (p=.021), after controlling for demographic characteristics, severity of disability, life satisfaction, and health promoting lifestyle behaviors. Efforts to increase the employment and economic independence of people with disabilities should analyze the impact of secondary health conditions on employment. Although health promotion activities prevent or ameliorate many secondary conditions (Lorig, et al., 1999; Ravesloot, Seekins, & Walsh, 1997; Ravesloot, Seekins, & White, 2005), VR agencies currently cover only acute care services (Rehabilitation Services Administration, 2001). Treating acute episodes is costly to VR (Hoffman, Rice, & Sung, 1996). Integrating interventions designed to help consumers prevent and manage secondary conditions may reduce the need for medical services and improve employment outcome. Accordingly, the GOAL of this project is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a new health promotion intervention, Working Well with a Disability, on increasing health status, health promoting activities, and successful employment outcomes of people with disabilities served by the national network of Vocation Rehabilitation programs.

84,"Water deficit and scarcity are major environmental factors affecting stable crop production. In this project the target model crop rice is tested for improvement in a combination of abiotic stress tolerance traits. The traits include tolerance to drought and salt, as well as avoidance of water stress by improving water use efficiency (WUE). Two transcription factors identified in rice are used for overexpression studies in elite adapted rice indica and japonica cultivars, suitable for different rice-growing environments. The physiological parameters for WUE, drought and salt tolerance will be measured under field crop conditions to evaluate the interaction with different genotypic backgrounds. This will be supplemented by genome-wide microarray expression studies to analyze the interaction between the introduced genes and the different genotypic backgrounds, to reveal other genetic factors contributing to expression of the abiotic stress tolerant traits. One of the products of the project will be adapted rice cultivars, improved for abiotic stress traits useful for diverse ecosystems. This research will also contribute candidate genes for improvement of other crops for WUE, drought and salt tolerance by molecular breeding approaches using molecular markers as well as transgenic plants.

85,The goal of our research is to comprehensively test whether the allosteric properties of leaf and/or seed AGPase limit plant productivity. Our hypothesis is that both seed and leaf AGPase activity constrain leaf photosynthetic rates and limit plant growth under conditions found under modern intensive agriculture. To test this hypothesis we will create and test rice plants containing an upregulated AGPase under the control of a seed and/or leaf specific promoter. The two most novel aspects of our proposed research are the comprehensive nature of the work proposed and that the experiments will be performed using an agronomic crop. Successful completion of our proposed objectives would likely indicate that the native allosteric properties of both leaf and seed AGPase limit both photosynthetic rates and plant productivity. Improvements in both photosynthetic rates and plant yield via direct selection for modified AGP allosteric properties or the use of transgenic plants then may result in improved agronomic yield and contribute to the long-range improvement in and sustainability of U.S. agriculture.

The identification tools will allow recognition of all 322 native North American delphacid planthoppers, plus 42 potentially invasive species using Lucid3 expert system software, which is specifically designed for development of online identification tools. An interactive morphology guide will assist users with technical terminology. As part of project, two students will be trained in systematic entomology through investigations of the problematic genus Delphacodes. Student projects will include investigating species definitions, developing identification tools, and a morphological and molecular phylogenetic investigation. Student projects will assist in the development of online resources by developing new identification tools and providing technical input to the online information system.

87,"This project addresses the program priority of establishing mechanisms that determine the abundance and distribution of weedy and invasive species and the impact of these species on agroecosystems. It also investigates how agroecosystems impacted the evolution and proliferation of a weedy species (weedy rice) and will demonstrate how to minimize or eliminate its impact on food (rice) production. Weedy rice causes $93 million annual loss to rice growers in Arkansas alone. Our goal is to study agroecological and geographic factors contributing to the evolution, diversification, and persistence of weedy rice in the U.S. and to utilize knowledge of weed biology, evolutionary genetics, chemical tools, and cultural practices to eradicate recently introduced weedy rice and minimize weedy rice infestation wherever it is widespread. We aim to assess the distribution and infestation level of weedy rice in California (new introduction) and Arkansas (widespread occurrence) and identify agroecological factors that may be associated with proliferation of weedy rice; understand the population structure and the extent of gene exchange between cultivated and weedy rice; evaluate geographic, edaphic, or crop management variables associated with specific weedy rice genotypes or morphotypes; and minimize red rice impact on rice. Rice fields and growers will be surveyed. Red rice samples from surveyed fields will be characterized. A subset of red rice samples will be genetically analyzed using 48 loci of tagged gene sequences specific for rice. Genetic, morphological, and phenological traits will be analyzed in relation to information from origination site. On-farm experiments will be implemented to test program efficacies on weedy rice management/eradication. Grower field days will be conducted to showcase different weedy rice management strategies.

88,"Invasive species threaten plant, animal and human health. The devastating impact of invasive species have been recognized in the field of public health for several centuries, since cross-oceanic voyages ignited epidemics of diseases such as bubonic plague,influenza, smallpox, measles, cholera, diphtheria, typhoid, typhus, malaria, yellow fever,whooping cough, etc. In some countries, agricultural inspection and quarantine at ports of entry have been in place since the late 1800?s. Even in earlier times when the volume of trade and speed of transport were quite modest, highly damaging diseases and pests of crops and livestock occasionally breached port of entry barriers. However since trade has become progressively liberalized during the past 15 years, the volume of perishable cargo together with the number of arriving quarantine pests has been growing exponentially. For example, the volume of air cargo has been doubling every 5-6 years and the number of quarantine pests intercepted at port of entry has similarly increased. Concomitantly the rate of invasion and establishment of harmful organisms has accelerated dramatically. For example, at least one new invasive species per month becomes established in Florida (1,2). Invasive plants are severely damaging many natural ecosystems. Indeed, officials of the Nature Conservancy assert that invasive species are threatening all of the accomplishments of that organization (5). Australian pine encroachment is threatening the critically endangered rock iguanas in the Bahamas,giant milkweed and rubber vine are displacing native flora on the Turks and Cacos. Hydrilla is choking certain rivers in Jamaica. The Old World climbing fern, tropical soda apple, Melaleuca and Brazilian pepper are among the most troublesome invasive plants in Florida. Water hyacinth is a major concern in Guyana and Suriname. Indeed the invasion of native ecosystems by invasive alien species is now widely regarded as a leading threat to biological diversity. TSTAR-C Grants under PL 89-106 will be used to attain new information directed toward reducing and where possible eliminating the harmful effects of invasive species. Projects will address the following subject matter areas:(a) Plant and Animal Pests and Disease, (b) Terrestrial and Aquatic Invasive Plants, (c) Terrestrial and Aquatic Invasive Animals, (d) Other Projects as Deemed Important by the T-STAR Caribbean Advisory Committee. These projects are managed under an ?umbrella? management structure. References 1. Frank JH, McCoy ED. 1992. The immigration of insects to Florida, with a tabulation of records published since 1970.

89,"Our long term goal is to provide the applied biomass research community and industry with information to allow exploitation of the genes and pathways relevant to biomass accumulation in grasses. We will use rice as a model because of the powerful genetic and genomic resources in rice, and because, despite our historic selection away from biomass production for food-production purposes, rice has all the genes necessary for high biomass productivity. We will identify those genes to expedite improvement of productivity in candidate biomass plants (switchgrass, Miscanthus).

90,"Exposure to arsenic causes many severe health problems including various types of cancers. A recent survey indicated that rice produced from South Central U.S. contained elevated concentrations of arsenic. To support CSREES strategic Goal 4: Enhance Protection and Safety of the Nation's Agriculture and Food Supply, this research will develop an effective strategy to reduce arsenic content in rice grains. Soil samples will be collected from historically cotton growing field where high concentrations of arsenic are present. They will be characterized for composition, particle surface property, and other parameters related to plant growth. The speciation, total availability, and the binding strength of arsenic in soil, which are believed to be among the most significant factors impacting arsenic uptake by rice plants, will be quantified. Pot experiments will be conducted in a greenhouse using these soils, and the correlation between the arsenic concentration in rice and the arsenic availability/mobility in soil will be determined. Impacts of phosphate and iron-based materials on arsenic uptake by rice plants will be determined. This research can help rice growers to reduce the arsenic concentration in rice grain, and help consumers to reduce the potential health risk caused by rice consumption. It will also protect and promote the agriculture-based regional economy through producing better marketable products.

91,"Due to their non-sessile nature, plants must rely on chemical defenses against invading organisms. These often take the form of small organic molecules termed natural products, the largest number of which fall into the terpenoid chemical class. While these molecules have useful biological activity that may be broadly applicable in other settings, little is understood about how they are produced in plants. The purpose of this study is to define how rice produces a wide variety of such terpenoid natural products, and begin applying the gained information to other cereal crop plant species. In particular, to identify the genes responsible for the elaborating biochemical transformations that produce the bioactive natural products, particularly targeted at the many such diterpenoids produced in response to microbial infection as defensive antibiotics and/or are secreted from the roots to suppress the growth of competing soil microorganisms and neighboring plants. This will not only provide insights into how such biosynthetic production is carried out in plants and their physiological roles, but will also provide examples of novel biological catalysts that may be more broadly useful.

92,"The proposed research investigates the roles of the PsbP protein family members in higher plant photosynthetic capacity. The PsbP protein is essential for plant growth as a subunit of Photosystem II, the chloroplast enzyme that uses solar energy to convert water to oxygen. Interestingly, plant genomes contain a large family of PsbP-related genes, and the corresponding proteins have been found in the thylakoid lumen of chloroplasts (as is the case for the PsbP protein). While the PsbP protein has been the subject of a significant amount of research, it is unclear how the other family members contribute to photosynthesis. The first studies of these proteins indicate they impact photosynthetic capacity in various ways. The proposed biochemical experiments will define the interaction and role (if any) of these PsbP-related proteins in plant Photosystem II. However, in order to fully understand the diverse forms of the PsbP family of proteins, this research will also extend beyond the Photosystem II enzyme to identify interactions with other proteins in the thylakoid membrane and/or lumenal space. Finally, the majority of the PsbP protein family members have not been characterized by mutational analysis in any organism. Our genetic experiments using Arabidopsis and rice will focus on one sub-class within the PsbP protein family. This combination of biochemical and genetic experiments using different model organisms will allow for efficient characterization of the PsbP protein family members and broaden our understanding of how they contribute to optimal photosynthetic activity in plants.

93,"The endosperm of monocot cereal species, such as rice, maize, barley and wheat are the most important renewable source of food, feed, and industrial raw materials. Despite their importance, we have limited knowledge of the genes controlling endosperm initiation and growth in cereals. In both animals and plants, the Polycomb group genes (PcG) regulate several developmental pathways. In the model dicot plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, the PcG-related Fertilization Independent Seed (FIS) genes, so called because of the ability of the mutants to initiate endosperm growth without fertilization, have been implicated in the control of endosperm initiation and growth patterning. Genetic studies in Arabidopsis have identified four FIS genes called MEDEA, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED 2, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM and MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1. Although there are distinctive differences between endosperm development in dicots versus monocots, none of these genes have thus far been investigated functionally in rice or any other cereals, or generally in any monocots. My long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms controlling endosperm proliferation and patterning in cereals. In this project, I will identify and study potential rice FIS genes and investigate their potential functions in rice endosperm development. This fundamental research into the FIS genes in rice will provide a useful foundation to understanding the critical process of endosperm development in cereals, including other important crops species like maize and wheat.

94,"Rice is one of the world's most important food crops and a major crop in some U.S. states. Rice is also used as a model system for the cereals, because of its small genome, which has been completely sequenced, as well as other features that facilitate experimental biology such as ease of transformation. Unraveling the functions of the estimated 40,000+ genes in rice will have a significant impact on the biology, as well as breeding, of rice and other cereals. The International Rice Functional Genomics Consortium which includes leading researchers from USA, has been coordinating the international efforts towards this end. The Consortium organizes the International Symposium of Rice Functional Genomics (ISRFG), which is the most important conference in rice genomics, and attracts wide international participation. The 6th ISRFG will be held in Korea in November 2008, and is expected to have 400 participants from 30 countries. This conference will inform the participants of the current status of rice functional genomics research, stimulate exchanges of ideas, collaborations, and efficient strategies for achieving the goal of understanding the functions of all rice genes. This grant will help to subsidize costs for attending the Symposium by participants from the USA, emphasizing graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Their participation in this conference will benefit and enhance research in USA using rice as an experimental system, as well as research into other cereal crops.

95,"The proposed research may identify methods by which PTGS of transgenes can be avoided without compromising plant defenses or regulation of endogenous genes. In A. thaliana different viral suppressors have been shown to have quite different effects on plant morphology, accumulation of miRNAs, and accumulation of siRNAs [14, 15, 108]. While Chapman et al. [15] found all tested suppressors caused major developmental abnormalities in arabidopsis, Dunoyer et al. [14] found that P25 and P38 did not cause noticeable defects. Both groups tested P38, but neither reported expression levels. It may be that P38 was expressed at lower levels in the plants showing normal development. Regardless of what factors explain the developmental differences observed by the two groups, Dunoyer et al. [14] produced P25 and P38 expressing plants that significantly reduced silencing of an endogenous chalcone synthase gene, while not inducing obvious developmental defects. This offers great encouragement for the possibility of identifying repressors that have similar side-effect free results in sugarcane. The proposed research represents one of the first systematic validation of miRNAs in a monocot plant. Research in plants, fungi, and animals suggests that the RNA silencing pathway is ancestoral to the divergence of these kingdoms, and many features are conserved between them. However, there are some important differences between them, e.g. the number of Dicer proteins and the size classes of siRNA. The majority of plant research on small RNAs has been carried out in dicot plants, primarily A. thaliana and N. benthamiana. Although many miRNAs are conserved between A. thaliana and rice, some of the A. thaliana miRNA families are not found in rice [30, 37]. Investigations on monocot plants such as sugarcane will identify aspects of RNA silencing conserved between monocots and dicots, but may also identify characteristic differences. The magnitude of the problem: In 2006, Hawaii sugarcane plantations were able to harvest 1.6 million tons of sugarcane from 42,100 acres and produce 213,000 tons of raw sugar [110]. Sugar prices during 2006 were approx. $351 per ton of raw sugar, which translated to a total value of $74.8 million. Using sugarcane plants to produce high value proteins could significantly increase the economic competitiveness of the Hawaii sugar industry. For example, recombinant GM-CSF for human therapeutic use is produced in yeast and sold under the name Leukiner by Berlex (www.berlex.com). World sales of Leukiner totaled $77 million in 2003. US Medicare payments for 50 ?g doses of Sargramostin (generic drug name) are set at $24.47. At that price, the 2003 world sales of Leukiner represent approx. 157 g GM-CSF.

96,"The grass inflorescence makes the seeds that are the source of the majority of the world's calories, and a clear understanding of the genetic control of inflorescence development will be key to improving yields in the cereal grasses. The blockage of leaf growth is characteristic of nearly all grass inflorescences and is an important event in the switch from non-reproductive to reproductive growth. We have identified a maize gene, Tassel sheath1, which is necessary to block leaf growth in the inflorescence. Our proposed experiments will help determine how Tassel sheath1 controls leaf outgrowth. We will test if this gene has a similar function in other important cereal crops including rice and barley, since this trait appears to have evolved early in the evolution of the cereals. Lastly, to more completely understand this unique developmental process, we will characterize other maize mutants that appear to be similar to tsh1. These studies should generate tools and knowledge that may be useful for improving crop yields.

97,"Field experiments at the University of Missouri-Delta Research Center will be conducted to improve management systems for rice production in the upper Mississippi River Delta Region. This project will seek to reduce irrigation fuel costs for rice farmers, develop effective herbicide programs to control weeds in sprinkler irrigated rice, and investigate insecticide seed treatments for rice water weevil control. Rice production has a positive impact on the communities in the upper Mississippi Delta region. In addition to providing income for farmers in the region, rice production helps create jobs for workers at agricultural chemical dealerships, crop consultants, and employees of a rice mill located at New Madrid, Missouri. This project will compare methods of lowering irrigation costs for flood irrigated rice by improving pump and motor/engine efficiencies, reducing inlet pressures, and improving overall system efficiencies. Rice water weevil infestations in production fields vary depending on flood depth. Tests will study the effect of irrigation flood depth and seed treatments on rice water weevil control. The use of center pivot sprinkler irrigated rice has the potential to reduce the amount of water needed for rice. However, weed control may be more difficult. Research with sprinkler irrigation will be conducted with new rice varieties and hybrids which contain a technology which permits broadcast applications of imidazolinone herbicides. Scientists will calculate the cost of each treatment in field experiments and look of lower cost methods for farmers to improve irrigation and pest management.

98,"The recent flood of genomic studies coupled with powerful new molecular technologies has led to rapid advances in our understanding of host/pathogen interactions. Host defense mechanisms and mechanisms of pathogen virulence are just a few of the topics that can now be addressed with some depth. As new information is obtained from some of the most thoroughly studied systems, it becomes that much clearer the extent to which we still have only limited understanding about host/pathogen interactions. It has become evident that interactions between bacterial pathogens and higher organisms such as complex plants and animals rely on highly evolved, sophisticated communications between the two partners. However, much less is known about interactions established between bacterial pathogens and lower eukaryotes. These interactions likely represent host/pathogen interactions at the most fundamental level, involving rudimentary pathways and processes that have provided the basis from which more complex pathogen virulence and host defense systems have evolved. Our overall goal is to utilize the interaction between the biocontrol agent Lysobacter enzymogenes, a bacterial pathogen of fungi, and the economically important fungal pathogen of rice, Magnaporthe oryzae, as a simple model system of study. Gaining knowledge of pathogen attack and fungal host defense is expected to improve our understanding of host/pathogen interactions, as well as allow for the harnessing of this information into application-based systems for more effective crop production.

99,"The Mexican rice borer (MRB), Eoreuma loftini (Dyar) and the sugarcane borer (SCB), Diatraea saccharalis (F.) are serious pests of sugarcane and rice. Since MRB was introduced from Mexico in 1980, it has spread northward through the Texas Rice Belt and now threatens the Louisiana sugarcane and rice industries. MRB and SCB have become the key pest complex of Texas Gulf coast rice, with insecticide use approaching three applications, annually. Sugarcane and rice generate over $2.5 billion annually for Texas and Louisiana stakeholders, but these commodities are at risk from this new pest complex and usage restrictions, mandated by FQPA, on organophosphate (OP) insecticides. Eventual annual losses of $220 million in sugarcane and $45 million in rice due to MRB invasion would be expected based on current production practices. We propose to solve the problems of our stakeholders by developing and implementing a diversified, proactive stalk borer IPM program which will be expected to mitigate sugarcane/rice potential FQPA-related constraints and reduce stalk borer populations. Within season management progress emphasizes cultivar resistance, minimizing plant stress, and timely use of insecticides. This proposal mandates more of a landscape approach to IPM focusing on selected non-crop hosts (at least during certain times of the year), and late season cultural practices combined with a more creative use of new environmentally-friendly insecticides to reduce area-wide pest populations. The significance to bioenergy, including corn and sorghum, is also noted. An integral component of the proposal is stakeholder input and direct involvement in the performance and evaluation of the research objectives.

100,"Ultraviolet light is known to have adverse effects on materials, plants, animals and humans. Specifically, the USDA is interested in monitoring the variation and trend of ultraviolet light at the Earth's surface to evaluate these damaging effects on crops, trees, and livestock. This UVB Network is the only remaining US national monitoring effort for these wavelengths. This program provides high quality UVB data, dating back to 1995, which is publically available through the Internet. Our dataset is being used for agricultural research at the Agricultural Research Station at Beltsville, University of Maryland, Colorado State University, Utah State University, Mississippi State University, Purdue University, Cornell University, and the University of Nebraska; for health research at the University of California at Davis, University of Colorado Health Center and the U.S. Naval Warfare Center, Philadelphia; for education (including at several high schools); for research on the influence of UVB on the viability and spread of powdery mildew on wine grapes; for aerosol, air quality, and climate change studies in Houston and Mexico City, and at other universities and government agencies for a variety of projects. Experiments have revealed that enhanced UVB light has adverse impacts on growth, yield, and quality of crops such as soybean, wheat, rice, sorghum, cotton, and corn. On-going experiments in growth chambers at Mississippi State University study the effects of enhanced UVB radiation and high temperature on cowpeas. The effects of UVB radiation and soil moisture on leaf litter decomposition were investigated through experiments in a greenhouse at CSU, and the results are currently being analyzed. Experiments were carried out to evaluate and quantify the effects of UV radiation on the early development of soybean. Two cotton growth simulation models were incorporated into a regional climate model in order to quantify the impact on cotton yields of enhanced UVB radiation combined with drought stress. These effects are being specified and quantified by our research group and incorporated into crop models. We are also working with other scientists to couple the crop models with a regional climate model as well as other models to develop an integrated assessment system to evaluate the risks of climate change and variation in the national agriculture and the international food security. A study of preliminary results of UVB trends across the continental US has recently been submitted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Other publications describe the algorithms to derive new products from our datasets and new methods to retrieve column ozone and other atmospheric variables from our measurements. Some of these publications describe the development of climatology products while others compare our datasets with satellite observations or various networks. The publications also include results from experiments and simulations about UVB effects, climate changes, environment, ecosystem, and sustainability.

101,"Rice blast disease is caused by a fungus, and is one of the most economically important and destructive diseases of rice and related grasses, including barley, rye and pearl millet. Worldwide, this disease results in major epidemics and yield losses of rice. The utility of two historically important strategies for defeating the rice blast fungus, chemical pesticides and naturally occurring resistance in rice, is severely limited by the fungus' ability to overcome these strategies, rendering them ineffective. If we can pinpoint exactly how the fungus infects, grows within, and reproduces in its host plants, we can more accurately design novel disease control strategies. The ultimate goal of our project is to contribute knowledge towards understanding how the rice blast fungus infects its host plants. A successful infection of the host results from the fungus moving smoothly from one infective life cycle stage to the next, which can only be accomplished by careful control over the expression of its genes. There are several levels of gene control in many organisms ranging from humans to fruit flies. We will specifically target one of these levels, called small RNAs, in the rice blast fungus. Small RNAs are short stretches of nucleic acids that can `match' the sequence of specific genes within a genome. Extensive research on small RNAs has revealed that, along with other jobs, these tiny molecules can control whether a gene will be turned on or off; small RNAs represent a sort of `fine-tuning' mechanism for gene regulation. Thus far, little is known about small RNAs in filamentous fungi, particularly plant parasites; our study aims to fill in these gaps. To do this, we are using several approaches that complement each other; the first approach is genetic and involves `breaking' genes in the fungus that, based on their DNA sequences, might be involved in producing small RNAs. Once we have generated these mutants, we can see whether the small RNAs have disappeared, and what effect this has on growth of the fungus and its ability to infect host plants. Because small RNAs can control gene expression, we will look at expression of all fungal genes when small RNAs are gone (i.e. the mutants). What effect will a lack of small RNAs have on gene expression? What types of genes will be most effected? We can achieve this goal by using microarray technology; microarrays are microscope slides that contain every gene from our fungus. We will put the genetic complement from several of the mutants onto these slides, read the slides using a special scanner, and analyze the data; this data will tell us how genes change when small RNAs are no longer present. Finally, we will sequence small RNAs from the fungus under different environmental conditions, including wild type growth conditions, nutrient starvation, and while infecting the host plant. This will tell us quantity and type of small RNAs produced under different conditions. Together, these three approaches will provide a comprehensive survey into the roles of small RNAs- we will be able to see how they impact gene regulation of the fungus, and how this ties into growth and virulence. base; Blast Cell; Chemicals; Complement; Data; Data Analyses; design; Disease; disorder control; DNA Sequence; Drosophila genus; Epidemic; Fungal Genes; fungus; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; Genetic; Genome; Goals; Growth; Human; Infection; Knowledge; Life Cycle Stages; Magnaporthe; Microarray Analysis; Microscope; Molds; mutant; novel; Nucleic Acids; Nutrient; Occupations; Organism; Oryza; Parasites; pathogen; Pathogenicity; Pennisetum; Pesticides; Plants; Poaceae; Reading; Research; Resistance; Rice; Role; Rye cereal; Slide; Small RNA; Sorting - Cell Movement; Starvation; Stretching; Surveys; VirulenceA COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF SMALL RNA SPECIES IN THE RICE BLAST PATHOGEN, MAGNAPORTHE ORYZAE, AND THEIR ROLE IN PATHOGENICITY",1e-06,0.999999,0.9999910001219314,0.9843168319195154,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06

103,"Soil salinity is a serious environmental stress limiting plant productivity. In addition to protein-coding genes, research in the last several years has established that small non-coding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are also critical regulators of plant growth, development and stress responses. However, the involvement of small RNAs and their function in abiotic stress resistance in crop plants has not been explored. The project goal is to identify miRNAs involved in salt stress tolerance in rice, which is one of the most important crops with a completely sequenced genome. In a preliminary experiment, small RNA libraries were generated from untreated rice seedlings (control) and seedlings exposed to salt stress and sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing method. We obtained 58,781 and 80,990 genome matching reads from control and salt-treated libraries, respectively. The frequencies of some miRNAs are different between control and salt-treated libraries.

104,"Flooding resulting from heavy rains or poor soil drainage inundates approximately 20% of lowland rice paddies throughout the world each year. Yield losses due to flash flooding exceed $1 billion per year in Asia. Flooding also causes serious reductions in the yield of rice and other crops in the US each year. A major goal of rice breeders is to generate lines that can withstand 14 days or longer of submergence at the seedling stage. Another goal is to develop rice lines that can become well established when sown as dry or imbibed seeds into paddies. These lines will reduce the need for herbicides in rice cultivation in the US. The goal of the USDA NRI-CSREES Sub1 Rice Project has been to obtain a clear understanding of the mechanisms of submergence/flooding tolerance in rice. Success in this mission has been possible because of the remarkable genetic diversity in submergence tolerance in rice germplasm, as well as advances in rice transformation technology and genome sequence data. Thus far we have identified and characterized a region on one of the 12 chromosomes of rice, called the Submergence-1 locus (Sub1)), that is a key regulator of the response to submergence/flooding. The genes in the Sub1 region vary in both number and activity amongst rice cultivars. One of the Sub1 genes is present and active at high levels only in rice that is tolerant of prolonged submergence. This gene, called Sub1A, can be transferred to other rice lines by use of traditional breeding methods or by gene-transformation technology to produce new submergence tolerant cultivars. We have discovered that Sub1A is important in regulating the response to plant hormones that promote the seedling to accelerate growth during submergence in order to escape the inundation. Our quest is to further characterize the cellular processes that are regulated by the Su1A gene. Of particular interest is the interaction between Sub1A and a related gene called Sub1C that resides in the Sub1 region in all rice lines. Sub1C activity during submergence appears to drive the rapid growth response that results in untimely death of the plant when floodwaters are deep. Through the increased understanding of the specific roles of Sub1A and Sub1C in the regulation of the activity of a cohort of genes, the responsiveness to hormones and control of metabolism, it will be possible to regulate the response to submergence during seed germination as well as in established seedlings. This project should provide new valuable insight into the complex responses to submergence that will augment development of plants with increased resilience to flooding at specific developmental stages.

105,"The project goal is to determine how sumoylation regulates cold acclimation. Our premise is that SIZ1 (E3 ligase)-mediated SUMO modification of ICE1 is a focal regulatory process in low temperature activation of CBF3 (transcription factor), a key regulator of cold acclimation. The project research is focused to determine the mechanisms by which SUMO modification of ICE1 activates CBF3 expression. Further, experimentation will determine the functional interplay between SUMO modification of K393 and post-translational modification that occurs at S403. The research results should have direct translational application to crops. Sumoylation is a conserved process in eukaryotes that is linked to transcription factor activity through chromatin modifications that are involved in epigenetic responses that occur during growth and development, and environmental adaptation. Further, the CBF low temperature signaling cascade appears to be conserved in plants and has been implicated in cold acclimation of crops, most notably rice and tomato. SIZ1 and ICE1 orthologs also exist in other plants including crops. The proposed research includes experimentation to establish functional conservation of SIZ1 and ICE1 orthologs from rice and tomato in cold acclimation through the regulation of a CBF-dependent cascade. It should be emphasized that during the structure/function experimentation with ICE1, an ICE1 allele that enhanced freezing tolerance was identified. Experimentation will determine if this ICE1 allele (or an allele of the orthologous crop gene) can enhance freezing tolerance of rice and tomato.

106,"Lipolysaccharide (LPS) is a surface component of Gram-negative bacteria. Though its involvement in pathogenesis in animals is well documented, the importance of LPS in interactions with plants has only recently come to light and is poorly understood. Bacterial type III secretion plays an essential role in pathogenesis by delivering, into the host cell, proteins called effectors that carry out functions important for disease. Knowledge of the identity and specific functions of effectors is incomplete. Focusing on bacterial leaf streak of rice (Oryza sativa), a disease of emerging importance and a model for bacterial diseases of crop plants, this project aims to elucidate the functions of LPS in disease and to identify and characterize effectors important in counteracting plant defenses. By deepening our understanding of plant-bacterial interactions, the results of this project will support the development of effective and durable plant disease control strategies. The project addresses the following priorities of the Microbial Biology (B): Microbial Associations with Plants Program: 1. Elucidation of molecular mechanisms of disease and resistance interactions between microbial plant pathogens and their host plants. 3.

107,"Drought is the major culprit behind crop losses worldwide, with billion dollar losses in the USA. WRKY transcription factors are key regulators of many plant stress responses but until recently, there were only tantalizing pieces of evidence linking WRKYs with drought responses. We now know that over 15% of the rice WRKY gene family (seventeen genes) are highly induced by drought in leaves and/or roots. Similar but less complete evidence comes from other plants. We have identified this as a major gap in our knowledge of drought responses and an opportunity to increase drought tolerance. Our hypothesis is that WRKYs are regulators of water stress responses and that similar genes regulate these responses in different plant species. Our goal is to identify WRKY genes that regulate drought responses in rice and soybean and develop a tool to identify similar genes in other crop plants. The project will not only increase our knowledge of drought responses in crop plants but also lead to new approaches aimed at reducing crop losses in the USA. biological adaptation to stress; Droughts; Gene Family; Genes; Goals; improved; Knowledge; Lead; Link; novel strategies; Plant Roots; Plants; response; Rice; Soybeans; tool; transcription factor; Water StressWRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AS TOOLS TO IMPROVE DROUGHT RESPONSES",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1.2973265106078282e-05,1e-06,1e-06,0.999088974797633
108,"Seed dormancy promotes the survival of seed-bearing plants in natural, and it is also contributes to the persistence of weeds in agro-ecosystems and provides cereal crops with resistance to pre-harvest sprouting. To elucidate genetic, evolutionary, and physiological mechanisms of seed dormancy in cereals, we are using a map-based cloning strategy to characterize naturally occurring genes from the individual chromosomal segments (i.e., quantitative trait loci or QTLs) associated with seed dormancy in weedy rice (Oryza sativa). Weedy rice is also known as  red rice  because of its red pericarp color. Recently, we cloned the qSD7-1 dormancy QTL underlying gene Os07g11020, which is annotated as a transcription factor and is the same as the red pericarp color gene Rc from wild rice (O. rufipogan). In this research we will confirm the function of the Rc transgene on dormancy, examine Rc allelic differentiation in seed dormancy, and identify gene networks regulated by the qSD7-1 underlying gene. We will select advanced (T3 to T4) transgenic lines to determine the effect of the Rc transgene on seed dormancy under controlled conditions, introduce Rc alleles from tropic and temperate weedy and wild rice into the same (or isogenic) background to identify functional DNA sequence mutation(s) affecting the degree of dormancy, and use the isogenic lines and rice genome microarray to identify physiological pathways controlling the dormancy and paricarp color traits. Expected outputs will include the information about key element(s) within the Rc locus impacting the degree of dormancy and molecular pathways regulated at a transcription level by the dormancy gene and the knowledge about how to use a naturally occurring dormancy gene to improve resistance of cereal crops to pre-harvest sprouting by conventional breeding and transgenic approaches.

109,"The majority of the vascular flowering plants, including most crops species, are able to develop symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The symbiosis occurs in ecosystems throughout the world and has a profound effect on plant life and ecosystem function, largely through impacts on plant phosphorus nutrition. The AM symbiosis is a highly co-evolved partnership, in which the coordinate differentiation of both symbionts results in development of a specialized symbiotic interface, over which nutrients are exchanged. In order to develop crop plants that are optimized to obtain maximal benefit from the AM symbiosis, it is necessary first to understand which genes control the AM symbiosis and the molecular basis of their function. We have identified two genes, from Medicago truncatula, STR and MtPT4 that are essential for development of the AM symbiosis and for symbiotic Pi transport. The goals of this project are to characterize the molecular and biochemical functions of STR in M. truncatula and to determine the potential relationship of STR and MtPT4. In parallel, the function of rice and soybean orthologs of STR and MtPT4 will be determined. Advances in understanding the AM symbiosis that underpin the deployment of these associations in agriculture will have significant implications for sustainability and long-term environmental quality.

110,"Emerging evidence suggests that ethylene (ET) and its antagonistic interaction with abscisic acid (ABA) may play a more crucial role than salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in rice disease resistance. It was proposed that flood- or hypoxia-induced ET biosynthesis in rice is critical for field resistance and management of rice blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae) in the southern U.S. To determine the role of ET biosythesis and signaling in rice disease resistance, we generated a number of transgenic rice lines impaired in ET biosynthesis or signal perception. Transgenic analysis suggests that a stress-responsive rice MAP kinase (OsMPK5) is a negative regulator of disease resistance as well as ET biosynthesis and signaling. To gain further insight into the OsMPK5-mediated signaling pathway, a combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical and proteomic methods will be used to study how OsMPK5 may regulate ET biosynthesis and signal transduction. A better understanding of the ET-mediated disease resistance in rice will help improve breeding strategies and cultural practices for effective disease control. Since rice is an important model for monocots, the data and discovery from this study may have broader impacts on other cereals, turf grasses and biofuel crops important to the U.S. agriculture.

111,"Grain sorghum is the third most widely grown cereal crop in the US and fifth most widely grown in the world. Sorghum is uniquely adapted to drought prone areas where other cereals regularly fail. Unfortunately, research efforts on improving this crop pale in comparison to wheat, rice or maize world wide. The Great Plains Sorghum Improvement Center (GPSIC) is a multi-disciplinary, multi-university project designed to focus a critical group of scientists on the genetic improvement, production, and utilization of grain sorghum. The results will have application in the great plains of the US and throughout the drought prone areas of Africa, South America and Asia where sorghum is widely grown. The GPSIC has groups of scientists addressing basic genetics and sorghum crop improvement, the physiology of the crop, sorghum production, pest and disease management, fertilization, particularly nitrogen use efficiency, and the utilization of sorghum for new food products. In particular this group is addressing issues such as yield potential, drought tolerance, weed control, N use efficiency and the use of sorghum as a source of gluten free food.

112,"Daily rhythms in gene expression ensure that many biological processes are phased to occur at the correct time of day or night. Appropriate phasing of gene expression to match the environment is critical to plant growth. Understanding diurnal regulation of gene expression is especially important given the likelihood for significant climate change. The goal of this project is to study variation of diurnal gene expression regulation in rice. By comparing within a species we will be able to infer the role of phased gene expression in domestication and adaptation to different light/temperature environments. This study will contribute to the long-term goals of understanding the mechanisms underlying plant adaptations to geographic variation in light and temperature and thus has potential to enhance economic opportunities for the agriculture industry. Climate change may lead to shifts in the geography of arable land, thus affecting the diurnal environments in which crops are cultivated. This research will provide knowledge and tools to modify the coordination of gene expression with diurnal light/temperature cycles and thus enable engineering of crops that will grow well in regions where they are not currently cultivated.

113,"Almost all crops and other flowering plants produce red or purple pigments some time during their life. The vast majority of plants from corn and rice to apples and broccoli produce anthocyanin pigments derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. The chemistry and molecular biology of the anthocyanins has been extensively studied and is well known. However, a single related group of flowering plants do not produce anthocyanins, but instead produce red pigments based on the amino acid tyrosine. These pigments are called betacyanins or betalains after the beet genus, Beta. Besides beets, this betalain producing group includes, spinach, swiss chard, Amaranthus, Quinoa, portulaca, and cactus. Almost nothing is known about the genes and enzymes for the steps in this pathway, or how the pathway is genetically regulated. In addition, it is not understood how or why this pathway may have evolved in the middle of the flowering plants. This project is aimed at discovering the genes that encode steps in the betalain pathway and understanding the pathway regulation. New libraries of expressed genes will be constructed from betalain plants and genes will be randomly sequenced. Potential betalain genes will be identified by similarity to genes encoding proteins with predicted functions. These potential genes will be tested for their abilities to complement betalain mutants when expressed in these plants. The overarching goals are to understand how betalains are made from tyrosine, how the pathway is genetically regulated, how the pathway evolved and possibly how the pathway can be engineered into other species.

114,"Feral hogs, European wild hogs, Russian wild hogs, wild boars, razorbacks, rooters, or hybrids of these are all names for the same species, Sus scrofa. Feral hog populations are spreading across the United States with little resistance from the private and public sector, causing considerable damage in their wake. We are suggesting control by a means not currently used in the United States, but has been shown and analyzed elsewhere to be the most cost-effective means of control-baiting with a lethal toxicant. Although feral hogs are protected as a game species in some states, their damage is well-known by those who are in direct contact with them: farmers, ranchers, federal and state wildlife managers, forest managers, city and county municipalities, and other private organizations and citizens. Damage has occurred in agriculture and silviculture and feral hogs represent a means of disease transmission to livestock. Physical damage includes rooting of pastures, forests, vineyards; consumption of crops (milo, corn, wheat, rice, peanuts, and potatoes, etc.); land erosion; and preying upon calves, lambs, and kids. More recently, as the populations increase at an alarming rate, concern has shifted to disease transmission. Feral hogs harbor diseases and parasites that can be transferred to livestock including: foot and mouth disease, pseudorabies, cholera, trichinosis, African swine fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, anthrax, ticks, fleas, lice, and various flukes and worms. Many of these diseases could be used in bioterrorism attacks and greatly threaten the livestock industry as a whole. Upon live-capture, tests will be initiated to determine a viable bait formulation that can be tested in the field and in the future be available to consumers as a market bait. The bait will add another tool and technology to a growing problem by supplying the public and private sectors with a cost-effective solution.

115,"Objective(s): Objective 1:  Refine the sorghum genome map to accelerate map-based gene discovery and comparative analyses of genes and gene networks in the Poaceae family.  Completion of a genome map of sorghum will permit direct cross-referencing of the genomes of sorghum, rice, and maize, thereby permitting a unified Poaceae genome map to be assembled.  This map and associated technology platforms will enhance gene discovery and expedite germplasm development via marker-assisted selection of key agronomic traits.Objective 2:  Utilize the sorghum genome map and genetic resources to clone key genes, including those controlling pollen fertility and drought tolerance.  As the products of Objective 1 are developed and released, positional cloning of genes will be simplified when complemented with high-quality linkage analyses.Sub-objective 2.A:  Elucidate the genetic basis of drought tolerance by positional cloning of a major stay-green QTL in sorghum.  Utilizing genetic stocks that are isogenic for a given stay-green QTL, high resolution maps have been constructed and continued refinement of each QTL will be achieved.  The further refinement of the QTL, coupled with detailed genetic, physiological, and molecular analyses of gene candidates will ultimately permit the gene(s) conditioning the stay-green phenotype to be cloned.Sub-objective 2.B:  Elucidate the genetic basis of pollen fertility restoration in sorghum by positional cloning of the Rf2 fertility gene.  Armed with fine mapping populations, genomic technology platforms for sorghum, and having cloned the first major sorghum fertility gene, positional cloning of Rf2 fertility restoration gene is achievable.Objective 3:  Map genome regions controlling photoperiodism and plant height in sorghum and identify robust molecular markers linked to these traits.  Completion of the genome map flanking these trait loci will expedite high-resolution mapping by revealing sequences representing potential markers for additional fine mapping, while also revealing candidate genes conditioning photoperiodic-insensitivity and reduced plant height.Objective 4:  Conduct proof-of-concept study, utilizing molecular markers, to expedite the conversion of tropical sorghum to temperate adaptation.  We will utilize the genome map and molecular markers discovered under Objective 3 to evaluate the introgression of recessive alleles conditioning photoperiod insensitivity, plus reduced plant height, into tropical germplasm.  This molecular evaluation will supplant the additional selfing generations and associated phenotypic evaluation normally required to track the introgression of recessive alleles into exotic germplasm during their conversion to photoperiod-insensitive, short-stature cultivars suitable for production in the U.S.Approach:The long-term goal of this project is to develop and utilize appropriate approaches and techniques in genomics and biotechnology to discover genes that control key agronomic traits, and to utilize these to augment breeding strategies that will facilitate the development of improved sorghum cultivars.  At present, positional cloning in sorghum is a daunting task, but the further refinement of a sequenced-based sorghum genome map will greatly simplify gene discovery.  We have targeted several agronomically critical genes for positional cloning, including the stay-green gene(s) conditioning sorghumÆs exceptional tolerance to post-anthesis drought.  In ongoing collaboration with scientists at Texas A&M University and the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland, Australia, an integrated approach that includes the plant disciplines of physiology, breeding, molecular genetics, and genomics is being employed to clone stay-green genes.  This information, and markers linked to these genes, will be exploited to introgress post-anthesis drought tolerance into elite sorghum cultivars.  Additionally, the molecular tools developed under Objective 1 and Sub-objective 2.A will facilitate our ongoing efforts to clone pollen fertility restoration genes.  Work with our Queensland collaborator will target cloning of Rf2 because of its importance in hybrid seed production, and the need for informative markers tightly linked to Rf2 for germplasm evaluation.  We also seek to map, at high resolution, the height and photoperiod-insensitive genes required to convert tropical sorghums to photoperiod-insensitive, short-stature cultivars suitable for production in the U.S.  Objectives 1-3 are complementary, and the knowledge gained under one objective will facilitate success in all.  Continued map resolution of photoperiodic and height trait loci obtained under Objective 3 will provide the foundation for identification of additional robust molecular markers and potential candidate genes, which will positively impact achievement of Objective 4.

Approach:Maize is an important crop as well as a model organism for other cereals such as sorghum, barley, rice and wheat. Our long term goal is to identify and characterize the activity of maize genes involved in plant production including tolerance to stressful growth conditions and regulation of flowering time. Recent work in model systems demonstrates that the circadian regulation of physiological activities is required for optimal plant growth and for tuning of responses to environmental cues. A comprehensive understanding of the circadian system in cereals is lacking; therefore, this proposal seeks to define the maize circadian system and assess the circadian oscillatorÆs contribution to important agronomic traits. Known circadian mutants will be tested for their response to salt and osmotic stress. Genes under circadian regulation in cereals will be identified by expression profiling, and this information used to computationally predict regulatory DNA elements that contribute to circadian gene expression. Reverse genetic approaches will evaluate the role of candidate photoperiodism genes in determining the timing of maize flowering. Maize inbreds and recombinant inbred lines will be analyzed for natural variation in overt circadian rhythms.

118,"Objective(s): The long-term goals of this project are to develop sugarcane cultivars that are better adapted and more economical to grow and harvest, to meet current and evolving needs of both a sugar and a biofuels industry, and to gain a greater understanding of sugarcane from genetic and physiological perspectives.  The objectives are to utilize:  (1) a basic breeding program to broaden the genetic base of parental germplasm and increase the adaptability of sugarcane to more temperate climates through the introgression of genes from wild species (Saccharum spontaneum) and related genera of sugarcane, and (2) parental clones from the basic program to develop sugarcane cultivars that are:  higher yielding (gross cane and sugar), require fewer inputs, more tolerant to disease and insect pests, and adapted to a broader range of environments than current cultivars (commercial breeding program). To assist in the selection process, trait-specific molecular markers for early sucrose accumulation, sugarcane borer resistance, and cold tolerance will be developed.Approach:Included in the basic programÆs breeding strategy to increase the genetic diversity of parental clones are: (1) acquisition and maintenance of germplasm from wild species of Saccharum and related genera; (2) characterization of parents and progeny for traits (cold tolerance, stubbling ability, disease resistance, and sugarcane borer resistance) that will increase the adaptation of sugarcane to LouisianaÆs temperate climate; (3) utilization of crossing and molecular marker techniques to produce interspecific and intergeneric hybrids containing new sources of disease and insect resistance and cold tolerance; and (4) recombination of progeny through backcrossing to develop parental material containing a concentration of desirable genes for the commercial breeding program.  Screening procedures will be developed to determine relative cold tolerance among clonal material in the basic breeding program.  In the development of cultivars for sugar and bioenergy, emphasis will be placed on yield components (stalk number, height, and diameter), quality components (sucrose and fiber accumulation), longevity (stubbling ability), harvestability (root anchorage, stalk erectness, and stalk brittleness), hardiness (winter survival, early spring vigor, and stalk freeze tolerance), stress tolerance (droughts, floods, and heavy clay soils), and resistance to stalk boring insects (sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer) and diseases (smut, rust, leaf scald, mosaic, yellow leaf virus, and ratoon stunting disease).  Recurrent selection techniques will be utilized to accelerate the rate of genetic improvement for important traits.  In addition, trait-specific markers closely associated with desirable traits such as sucrose accumulation, cold tolerance, and resistance to the sugarcane borer will be developed to assist breeders in eliminating undesirable plants early in the selection process.

119,"Objective(s): The long-term goal of this project is to develop improved wildrice cultivars through conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection for key traits affecting production efficiency. New genetic knowledge about these key traits is sought to develop cultivars more effectively and efficiently. Objective 1: Develop genetic resources with traits influencing production efficiency (seed shattering resistance, disease resistances, panicle type, and reduced height) and characterize the inheritance of those traits. Objective 2: Identify candidate genes for, and useful markers that are closely associated with, shattering resistance and disease resistances, using wildrice lines and mapping populations as well as comparative genetic and genomic information from Oryza sativa. Objective 3: Develop wildrice cultivars through conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection that have greater production efficiency and reduced height, that exploit heterosis, and that are more resistant to shattering, diseases, and other biotic and abiotic stresses.Approach:Genetic resources of wildrice (Zizania palustris) with improved seed shattering resistance, disease resistance, panicle type, and reduced height will be developed by identifying and selecting from existing genetic variability in wild rice populations using conventional breeding methods including recurrent selection. Phenotypic data from controlled crosses will be analyzed to characterize qualitative and quantitative inheritance patterns. Molecular markers and candidate genes for shattering resistance will be identified using QTL analysis based on comparative genomics with Oryza sativa and for resistance to two major wildrice diseases, fungal brown spot caused by Bipolaris oryzae and stem rot caused by Nakataea sigmoidea, by comparative genomics and gene expression analyses. The developed germplasm, genetic information, and molecular markers will be used to breed wildrice cultivars that have greater production efficiency including reduced height and lodging, reduced grain shattering losses, and reduced impact on productivity by diseases and other yield-limiting factors using both conventional and marker-assisted selection. The plant phenotyping and breeding research will be conducted at the University of Minnesota, North Central Research and Outreach Center, Grand Rapids, MN, and the molecular marker and gene expression research with collaborators on the University of Minnesota St. Paul campus.

122,"Objective(s): The long-term objective of this project is to better understand rice responses to pests, pathogens, and weather stress in the environment, and to use that information to enhance pest protection and production efficiency for a more sustainable U.S. rice production. Over the next 5 years we will focus on the following objectives: Objective 1: Map rice genes associated with resistance to sheath blight and blast diseases and identify sources of resistance to kernel and false smut diseases. Sub-objective 1.A. Map candidate genes for sheath blight resistance in rice. Sub-objective 1.B. Develop high-resolution genetic maps of Rhizoctonia solani phytotoxin. Sub-objective 1.C. Elucidate recognition mechanisms of the rice blast resistance gene, Pi-ta, to the pathogen avirulence gene AVR-Pita. Sub-objective 1.D. Identify sources of resistance to grain quality reducing diseases: false smut and kernel smut. Objective 2: Identify the physiological, environmental, and genetic factors associated with tillering and seedling vigor under cold temperatures in rice. Sub-objective 2.A.  Identify environmental and cultural factors that induce early tillering in indica germplasm and identify early tillering QTL in mapping populations. Sub-objective 2.B. Identify genomic regions associated with cold temperature stress at the seedling stage. Objective 3: Develop chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) and advanced backcross mapping populations using selected Oryza wild species to study the chromosomal location of grain shape, pest resistance, and domestication traits. Sub-objective 3.A. Introgress novel sheath blight resistance genes into US rice cultivars using Oryza wild species accessions.Sub-objective 3.B. Exploring transgressive variation in rice. Objective 4: Identify growth factors associated with changes in weed species populations in response to the use of herbicideûresistant rice cultivar technology and other non-conventional cultural management practices. Sub-objective 4.A. Determine the efficacy of weed-suppressive rice in reduced input rice production systems. Sub-objective 4.B. Quantify gene flow of herbicide resistance genes in commercial rice production.Approach:Genetic markers associated with QTLs linked to sheath blight resistance, sheath blight toxin sensitivity, and tillering will be identified in various mapping populations. Sequence diversity for the Pi-ta blast resistance gene in several species of rice and of the avirulence gene in the pathogen will be determined. Interactions of predicted host and pathogen proteins will be used to identify critical amino acid residues important for disease resistance. Cultivars and parents of existing mapping populations will be evaluated to identify sources of resistance to kernel and false smuts.  The impact of different tillage methods, fertilizer rates, and crop rotation systems on incidence of smut will be determined to give cultural management recommendations to farmers. To identify QTL underlying tillering in rice, we will identify growth conditions including soil temperature, planting depth, and fertilizer rates; sources; and timing that maximize the phenotypic differences between high- and low-tillering genotypes. Germplasm lines will be evaluated for coleoptile emergence under cold temperatures (11 degC) to identify sources that can be used to develop mapping populations. Novel sources of sheath blight resistance identified in wild species of rice (i.e., O. meridionalis, O. nivara, O. rufipogon) will be introgressed into a susceptible Southern U.S. cultivar through backcrossing. Putative sheath blight resistance QTL will be verified using inoculated field tests and greenhouse toxin assays. The O. rufipogon wild species of rice and several O. sativa sub-populations will be used to identify adapted gene complexes responsible for positive transgressive variation. Chromosome segment substitution lines and near isogenic lines (NILs) will be used to systematically explore the relationship between diversity and transgressive variation. In addition, lines containing O. rufipogon introgressions that alter flowering time, grain size and weight, and number of grains per plant will be analyzed to determine the impact of the introgressions on agronomic traits. High-tillering indica rice lines and commercial hybrids will be evaluated to determine if they have sufficient weed-suppression capabilities when coupled with low rates of herbicide and/or alternative production systems that result in effective weed control. Competitive interactions between rice and barnyardgrass (C4 weed species) will be assessed using 13C isotope depletion analyses of roots extracted from soil core samples.  Alternative cultural practices, including early planting, reduced irrigation, and decreased seeding rates, will be evaluated for their savings in water use and impact on weed control. Reciprocal outcrossing rates between commercial hybrid rice cultivars and common U.S. red rice biotypes will be investigated to determine the likelihood of herbicide resistance gene flow. Putative outcrosses will be verified using herbicide screening when herbicide-resistant cultivars serve as the male or assessment of unique plant characteristic and genetic markers when non-herbicide-resistant rice serves as the male.

124,"Objective(s): The long-term objective is to develop genetics of plant and seed chemistry useful in developing crops with improved end-use quality. The primary crops studied are barley and maize. The primary targeted end-uses are for feeds, foods, and biofuel production. Over the next five years the main focus will continue to be the genetics of plant and seed phosphorus.  There are three specific objectives. The first objective will be to identify and characterize genes perturbed in barley low phytic acid mutants. Second, this project will develop a better understanding of the relationship between seed phosphorus and inositol phosphate chemistry, plant performance, and stress tolerance. The third objective is to identify novel crop genotypes conditioning altered plant or seed phosphorus chemistry or related phenotypes that are of end-use value. This includes the development of genetic tools useful in breeding or engineering crops with normal shoot P but altered levels of seed total P, and the development of genetic approaches useful in engineering reduced shoot total P. This last objective involves developing genotypes that are tolerant to reduced plant total P.Approach:For the first objective, the first step is to select target mutant loci as targets. Characterization of phenotypes observed in the barley lpa mutation collection, in combination with chromosomal mapping data, and review of the current knowledge in this field, will be used to identify targets for gene identification.  Fine mapping of selected lpa loci will first be conducted. Genomics resources for barley, or comparative mapping data with other species such as rice, will be used to identify candidate genes. Sequencing of candidate genes will confirm if they are in fact the gene perturbed in the target mutant.  Definitive proof that a mutant phenotype is the result of a mutation in the identified gene may require additional studies such as ôcomplementationö.For the second objective, to develop a better understanding of relationship between seed phosphorus, inositol phosphate and plant performance such as stress tolerance, the first step would be to complete ôtranscription profilingö, using microarray analyses, to identify genes and functions impacted in selected genotypes or in response to selected stress treatments such as heat/drought stress. Genes whose expression or function is greatly impacted will be the focus of more targeted study. Their sequences, map position, and gene family relationships will be obtained. Expression profiles and biochemical/physiological function will be determined. For the third objective, two types of approaches will be used to develop genotypes with useful alterations in plant or seed phosphorus chemistry. These are ôforward geneticsö screens and ôreverse geneticsö approaches. In ôForward geneticsö, screens of various types of mutagenized populations will be conducted to identify mutations that impact plant or seed phosphorus. Populations screened will either be chemically mutagenized, or represent collections of transposon insertions. Mutants with interesting phenotypes such as ôreduced seed total Pö will then be the subject of in depth follow-up study, including chromosomal mapping and agronomic evaluation. Ultimately the gene perturbed in the mutation will be identified, and near-isogenic lines will be developed for use in agronomic and nutritional studies. In the reverse genetics component, mutations such as ôsingle nucleotide polymorphismsö (SNPs) will be isolated in target genes of interest. For example, many genes are already known to be important to phosphorus uptake and transport, but which specific genes or functions are important to seed total phosphorus is not known. Methods such as TILLING will be used to isolate mutations in target genes, which will then be used to determine the effect of such mutations on plant and seed phosphorus. BSL-1; 5/17/07.

125,"Objective(s): Conserve and distribute a wide range of small grains genetic diversity and associated information to researchers and breeders worldwide.  Strategically evaluate (phenotype) small grains genetic resources for priority biotic and abiotic stress resistance, quality factors, and other priority agronomic traits, and incorporate phenotypic data into the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) and/or other databases.  Make newly-found major genes and adult-plant genes for Ug99 stem rust resistance available to breeders for incorporation into adapted germplasm for the United States.  Characterize the genetic variability in small grain genebank collections via genotyping with leading edge genetic marker technology and geographic information systems.Approach:Acquisition priorities include the wild relatives of Triticum, Hordeum, Avena, and Oryza to fill species and ecogeographic gaps in the crop collections. Geographic regions of special interest are the Caucasus and Central Asia.  These gaps will be primarily addressed by collection expeditions and exchanges with other genebanks.  All acquisitions will follow USDA-APHIS protocols to avoid the introduction of harmful diseases and insects.  Mapping populations and other genetic resources developed in the Barley and Wheat Coordinated Agricultural Projects (CAP) will be stored and distributed as part of National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) genetic stock collections.  Established procedures will be used to maintain and regenerate all NSGC germplasm accessions, with special attention to seed preparation and planting, plant pathogen monitoring, harvest, and laboratory processing.  Seed will be provided to the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation for safety back up.  New information technology will be identified to increase the quality, accessibility, and value of the data collected.   The project will either conduct or coordinate systematic evaluations of important traits.  The small grains Crop Germplasm Committees (CGC) have previously developed lists of descriptors for evaluation and are consulted regularly for evaluation priorities.  Several evaluations, ongoing for a number of years and considered high priority by the CGC, will be continued.  Ug99 stem rust resistance research will focus on identifying new major and adult-plant genes in wheat landraces and making the new sources of resistance available to breeders for transfer to adapted germplasm for all regions of the U.S.  Evaluation of rice germplasm will be coordinated at the USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, Stuttgart, Arkansas and data will be returned to Aberdeen for inclusion in GRIN.  SSR markers will be employed to genotype the NSGC core subsets of wheat and barley, totaling 5,500 and 2,577 accessions, respectively. To eliminate variation due to heterogeneity within accessions, single-plant-selections for each core accession will be generated for genotyping.  Resulting data will be analyzed to better understand genetic variation within the collection, including the relationship between variation and geographic origin of accessions.  Country, state/province, locality, and latitude/longitude data for NSGC accessions are maintained in GRIN.  Traits of interest will be mapped and analyzed using GIS software and appropriate statistical techniques. Because stem and stripe rust of wheat and barley are of current concern worldwide, priority will be given to mapping the geographic origin of resistance.  Accession genetic diversity in the core collections, based on molecular marker data will be mapped to better understand its relationship to accession geographic origin, to elucidate relations between geographic patterns of molecular diversity and trait diversity, and to do gap analysis to identify priority areas for future collection.Replacing 5366-21000-022-00D (3/08).FY09 Program Increase $175,000FY10 Program Increase $37,200 Address; Adult; Agriculture; Area; Arkansas; Attention; Back; base; Biological Preservation; Central Asia; Cereals; Collection; Computer software; Consult; Country; Data; Databases; Descriptor; Evaluation; Expeditions; Future; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Markers; genetic resource; Genotype; geographic difference; Geographic Information Systems; Geographic Locations; Harvest; Heterogeneity; Information Networks; Information Technology; insect disease; interest; Laboratories; Maps; Molecular; molecular marker; Monitor; Natural regeneration; Oryza; Other Genetics; pathogen; Pattern; Phenotype; Plant Genes; Plant Preparations; Plants; Population; Procedures; Process; programs; Protocols documentation; Province; Relative (related person); Research; Research Personnel; Resistance; Resources; Rice; Safety; Seeds; Source; stem; Stress; Techniques; Technology; trait; Triticum; United States; Variant; WheatMANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL SMALL GRAINS COLLECTION RESOURCES",1e-06,0.999999,0.0001919073113845277,1e-06,0.005236726133925898,1e-06,1.7632145894286165e-06
126,"Objective(s): The long-term objective of this project is to develop improved rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasm for use in breeding elite varieties adapted to temperate environments by identifying, characterizing, and manipulating genes that affect crop productivity.  In temperate regions, seedling cold tolerance in rice is important for successful stand establishment and plant development, both of which directly impact yield.  Over the next five years, two major objectives will be addressed: 1) the molecular genetic basis of rice seedling cold tolerance conferred by the major quantitative trait loci qCTS12 and qCTS4 will be determined and 2) the information obtained from the analysis of qCTS12 and qCTS4 will be used to evaluate currently available germplasm and to develop new germplasm with enhanced cold tolerance. qCTS12 and qCTS4 have been fine mapped to regions containing a small number of genes.Approach:During this project, the genes that confer cold tolerance will be identified through transformation and candidate gene analysis experiments.  The genes and the proteins they encode will be characterized at the molecular level and their effect under field conditions will be determined.  The utility of this of this information for evaluating other rice germplasm and for developing efficient approaches to identifying novel sources of cold tolerance will be examined.  New germplasm for breeding will be developed by transferring the qCTS12 and qCTS4 genes through conventional and molecular breeding approaches.  In addition to providing tools and resources for germplasm improvement, genetic dissection of qCTS12 and qCTS4 will contribute to our fundamental understanding of cold tolerance in rice.

128,"Objective(s): The long-term objective of this project is to better understand rice responses to pests, pathogens, and weather stress in the environment, and to use that information to enhance pest protection and production efficiency for a more sustainable U.S. rice production. Over the next 5 years we will focus on the following objectives: Objective 1: Map rice genes associated with resistance to sheath blight and blast diseases and identify sources of resistance to kernel and false smut diseases. Sub-objective 1.A. Map candidate genes for sheath blight resistance in rice. Sub-objective 1.B. Develop high-resolution genetic maps of Rhizoctonia solani phytotoxin. Sub-objective 1.C. Elucidate recognition mechanisms of the rice blast resistance gene, Pi-ta, to the pathogen avirulence gene AVR-Pita. Sub-objective 1.D. Identify sources of resistance to grain quality reducing diseases: false smut and kernel smut. Objective 2: Identify the physiological, environmental, and genetic factors associated with tillering and seedling vigor under cold temperatures in rice. Sub-objective 2.A.  Identify environmental and cultural factors that induce early tillering in indica germplasm and identify early tillering QTL in mapping populations. Sub-objective 2.B.  Identify genomic regions associated with cold temperature stress at the seedling stage. Objective 3: Develop chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) and advanced backcross mapping populations using selected Oryza wild species to study the chromosomal location of grain shape, pest resistance, and domestication traits. Sub-objective 3.A. Introgress novel sheath blight resistance genes into U.S. rice cultivars using Oryza wild species accessions.Sub-objective 3.B. Exploring transgressive variation in rice. Objective 4: Identify growth factors associated with changes in weed species populations in response to the use of herbicideûresistant rice cultivar technology and other non-conventional cultural management practices. Sub-objective 4.A. Determine the efficacy of weed-suppressive rice in reduced input rice production systems. Sub-objective 4.B. Quantify gene flow of herbicide resistance genes in commercial rice production.Approach: Genetic markers associated with QTLs linked to sheath blight resistance, sheath blight toxin sensitivity, and tillering will be identified in various mapping populations. Sequence diversity for the Pi-ta blast resistance gene in several species of rice and of the avirulence gene in the pathogen will be determined. Interactions of predicted host and pathogen proteins will be used to identify critical amino acid residues important for disease resistance. Cultivars and parents of existing mapping populations will be evaluated to identify sources of resistance to kernel and  false smuts.  The impact of different tillage methods, fertilizer rates, and crop rotation systems on incidence of smut will be determined to give cultural management recommendations to farmers. To identify QTL underlying tillering in rice, we will identify growth conditions including include soil temperature, planting depth, and fertilizer rates, sources, and timing that maximize the phenotypic differences between high- and low-tillering genotypes. Germplasm lines will be evaluated for coleoptile emergence under cold temperatures (11oC) to identify sources that can be used to develop mapping populations. Novel sources of sheath blight resistance identified in wild species of rice (i.e. O. meridionalis, O. nivara, O. rufipogon) will introgressed into a susceptible Southern U.S. cultivar through backcrossing. Putative sheath blight resistance QTL will be verified using inoculated field tests and greenhouse toxin assays. The O. rufipogon wild species of rice and several O. sativa sub-populations will be used to identify adapted gene complexes responsible for positive transgressive variation. Chromosome segment substitution lines and near isogenic lines (NILs) will be used to systematically explore the relationship between diversity and transgressive variation. In addition, lines containing O. rufipogon introgressions that alter flowering time, grain size and weight, and number of grains per plant will be analyzed to determine the impact of the introgressions on agronomic traits. High-tillering indica rice lines and commercial hybrids will be evaluated to determine if they have sufficient weed-suppression capabilities when coupled with low rates of herbicide and/or alternative production systems that result in effective weed control. Competitive interactions between rice and barnyardgrass (C4 weed species) will be assessed using 13C isotope depletion analyses of roots extracted from soil core samples.  Alternative cultural practices including early planting, reduced irrigation, and decreased seeding rates will be evaluated for their savings in water use and impact on weed control. Reciprocal outcrossing rates between commercial hybrid rice cultivars and common U.S. red rice biotypes will be investigated to determine the likelihood of herbicide resistance gene flow. Putative outcrosses will be verified using herbicide screening when herbicide resistant cultivars serve as the male or assessment of unique plant characteristic and genetic markers when non-herbicide resistant rice serves as the male.

129,"This project addresses biological nitrogen fixation and supply of nitrogen for growth of crop plants. The experimental system is a filamentous nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium NOSTOC PUNCTIFORME. This organisms fixes nitrogen as a free-living entity in soils and when in symbiotic association with a variety of non-crop plants. We propose to apply the new technology of global transcription assays to identify genes and regulatory pathways essential for nitrogen fixation and symbiotic association. The results will be used to engineer new nitrogen-fixing symbioses with crop plants. This project is relevant to biological supply of fixed nitrogen in sustainable agricultural systems, especially paddy rice. The cyanobacterium NOSTOC PUNCTIFORME is unusual in its ability to converted nitrogen gas to ammonium in both the free-living growth state and in symbiotic association with non-crop plants. We seek to understand the regulatory mechanisms for the differentiation of motile filaments called hormogonia, which function as the infective units for symbiosis, and of heterocysts, cells specialized for nitrogen fixation. We especially want to know haw plants have exploited those mechanisms in establishment of a stable nitrogen fixing association.

The purpose of this project is to develop measures of these factors and to understand the relationship between the factors and food composition and structure. The project has identified a method for the production of rice starch with a commercial enzyme Alcalase (NovoNordisk). The rice starch powder prepared in this way is a very fine powder and less coarse that other starch powders. The average size of the rice starch granules is 5.5 microns. This method of preparation also minimizes damage to the starch granules as compared to other methods based on chemical treatments. The peptide by-products from the enzymatic preparation of rice starch have also been shown to have potential for healthy ingredients for foods. Thus this process, which separates starch from protein in milled rice, has provided some directions for the marketing of the two products.

However, the identities of these proteins, and the mechanism by which they enter the host cell, remain elusive. The first goal of this project is to identify genes that control the ability of Magnaporthe oryzae to colonize rice cells. Functional characterization of these genes will provide clues as to their roles in the pathogenic process.

The proposed research project will investigate the use of environmental-friendly microwave technology to extract oils and convert them into biodiesel through a transesterification reaction in which the oil is mixed with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting products are biodiesel and glycerol, an important chemical with multiple industrial and agricultural uses. Biodiesel can be used in most modern Diesel engines without any modifications and loss of performance. The main objectives are to extract, separate and characterize the lipid source in three oil feedstocks (rice bran, soybeans, and Chinese tallow trees seeds), to convert these oils into biodiesel, and to optimize the process such that it can be scaled to pilot and industrial level. The microwave extraction and transesterifications will be achieved in both batch and continuous mode.

140,"Louisiana's ideal plant growth environment places agriculture as a key contributor to the state's economy. More attention should be given to develop economically viable and environmentally-sound sustainable crop production systems. In 2006, Louisiana was among the top ten largest producers of cotton, sugarcane and rice in the United States. With the increasing demand for crop-based biofuel, corn, soybean, wheat and sugarcane acreage are expected to rise. Louisiana's agriculture is diverse, consisting of a wide array of crops growing on different soils. The reduction in productive lands, increased public concern for environmental quality, and economic constraints brought about by expensive and limited nutrient inputs emphasize the need for more effective soil fertility and nutrient management practices. The validity of fertilizer guidelines from multi-year and multi-site response trials can be altered in response to current changes in crop varieties, cultural management practices, and soil testing methodologies. Therefore, the value of soil testing as a tool to understand and manage fertilizer nutrients relies on frequent verification of fertilization guidelines which can be accomplished through field calibration studies. Also, remote sensor-based precise management schemes for N, the most important and the most limiting nutrient in crop production, needs to be developed. This proposed project intends to address critical gaps in soil testing and fertilizer recommendation guidelines for major crops of Louisiana. This would lead to more precise and efficient fertilizer management schemes that will result in optimum agronomic, economic and environmental returns in crop production.

Despite its economic importance, virulence mechanisms of B. glumae are poorly understood compared with that of other important plant pathogenic bacteria because the BPB research is currently in its early stages worldwide. This project aims to comprehensively identify and characterize all the potential virulence factors of B. glumae by mutational analysis, and to investigate how each virulence factor contributes to pathogenesis and affects the host defense system.

147,"Soil salinity is a serious environmental stress limiting plant productivity. In addition to protein-coding genes, research in the last several years has established that small non-coding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are also critical regulators of plant growth, development and stress responses. However, the involvement of small RNAs and their function in abiotic stress resistance in crop plants has not been explored. The project goal is to identify miRNAs involved in salt stress tolerance in rice, which is one of the most important crops with a completely sequenced genome. In a preliminary experiment, small RNA libraries were generated from untreated rice seedlings (control) and seedlings exposed to salt stress and sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing method. We obtained 58,781 and 80,990 genome matching reads from control and salt-treated libraries, respectively. The frequencies of some miRNAs are different between control and salt-treated libraries. We propose to investigate the regulation and function of these potential salt-stress-regulated miRNAs. Since putative target genes of these miRNAs have been identified computationally, we can construct miRNA-deregulated forms of these targets for improving plant salt tolerance. biological adaptation to stress; Code; Functional RNA; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genome; genome sequencing; Goals; improved; Libraries; Methods; MicroRNAs; plant growth/development; Plants; Productivity; Proteins; Reading; Regulation; Research; research study; Resistance; Rice; RNA library; Seedling; Small RNA; Sodium Chloride; Soil; Stress; stress tolerance; Untranslated RNAFUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF SALT STRESS REGULATED MICRORNAS IN RICE",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
148,"In the UN's Millennium Declaration, Kofi Annan challenged that,  We need a Blue Revolution in agriculture that focuses on increasing productivity per unit of water -  more crop per drop  . The Blue Revolution was named after the Green Revolution, which saw major increases in plant yield during the 20th century because of newly bred semi-dwarf varieties of wheat and rice. These varieties nearly doubled agricultural yields in the countries where green revolution varieties and growing techniques were adopted. Annan's challenge is a global one, but it is also particularly important to California, since a major portion of California's water supply is used for agriculture. Although the water-use problem is a complex one and its solution will be multi-faceted, the development of new  water-smart  crops and farming practices are likely to be central parts of the ultimate solution. This has intensified the urgency of research on plant water-stress responses so that the discoveries of basic science can be translated into new crops with better water-use and drought tolerance. Although residential water accounts for approximately 10% of total use (~70% agriculture, 20% industry), almost half of residential water is used for outdoor irrigation. Thus, efforts to develop drought tolerant crops will also benefit non-essential crops (i.e. those not intended for human consumption). The PI's research program has generated a number of strategies for engineering drought tolerance and this proposal explores the application of these technologies to perennial grasses. The project complements ongoing efforts to create drought tolerant crops and addresses an important area of water use critical in urban environments.

149,"Shoreline erosion is a severe problem in all coastal states of United States of America. Similarly, frequent hurricanes result in several farm lands unsuitable for cultivation due to the intrusion of sea water. Among various abiotic stresses, salinity and heavy metals severely affect the growth and production of the wetland species and rice of Louisiana. Hence, there is need to understand the basis of abiotic stress tolerance in marsh grass species (e.g., smooth cordgrass) for their further improvement and also design new rice varieties, whcih can grow in salt afflicted soil. Besides, it is necessary to understand the diversity and relatedness among different smooth cordgrass and sea oats (dune grass) at the genetic level. The knowledge generated would be useful for developing superior population in the caostal wetland restoration. Most current and sophisticated cutting-edge tools will be used in this study (1) to understand the salt tolerance of smooth cordgrass using rice as a model plant, (2) to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of smooth cordgrass and sea oats, and (3) to understand the heavy metal extraction by smooth cordgrass. The knowledge and resources generated through these investigations will be useful for designing and development of superior wetland grasses in coastal restoration, phytoremediation, and improved rice with high salt tolerance.

151,"Peroxisomes are small organelles found in virtually all eukaryotic cells (including plants and mammals). Some vital peroxisomal functions include storage oil metabolism in many important crop species, plant hormone metabolism, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. Generic defects in peroxisome formation or function can result in severe developmental defects. Several outstanding questions remain about important biochemical processes compartmentalized within peroxisomes, including relatively unexplored mechanisms for matrix enzyme turnover. This proposal will begin to address these questions using cell biology and reverse genetics approaches to identify mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice) that display stabilization of proteins that are normally subject to developmentally regulated degradation. This proposal also seeks to develop rice as a diverged model organism for investigating peroxisome biology in monocot crop species. Although there is a rich history of biochemical characterization of peroxisome function in rice and other cereals, there are virtually no genetic tools for understanding the functional significance of these important organelles in monocots. I anticipate that the tools developed during this research will facilitate the genetic dissection of peroxisome function in rice and other cereals. In addition, the preliminary reverse genetics approaches will help to determine the feasibility of designing forward genetics screens in rice, with the goal of identifying novel genes necessary for peroxisome biogenesis.

152,"The fundamental processes that underpin plant growth and development and disease resistance depend crucially on cell walls; however, a comprehensive understanding of wall biosynthesis and the relevant enzymes is lacking. This project aims to understand the biosynthesis and function of arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), which are major glycoprotein components of plant cell walls and implicated in many biological processes including cell proliferation and survival, development and growth, and plant-microbe interactions. The mechanism of AGP fucosylation and the role of fucose residues in the physiological function of AGPs are the focus of this project, which has two objectives: 1) biochemically characterize two putative AGP-fucosyltransferases in Arabidopsis (named FUT4 and FUT6) by developing an enzymatic assay to test the biochemical function of the FUT4 and FUT6 genes expressed in Arabidopsis cells, and 2) elucidate the physiological role of fucosylated AGPs in Arabidopsis, with respect to root growth, using fut4 and fut6 mutant plants as well as fut4/fut6 double mutant plants, before moving to crop plants such as rice. This research will contribute to an understanding of AGP biosynthesis and function and will represent the first analysis of an enzyme that adds sugars to an AGP. More broadly, this work addresses CSREES Strategic Goal 2 by contributing to an understanding of how plant cell wall biomass is made and allowing for its controlled manipulation to meet agricultural and societal needs in the wood, paper, textile, food, and biofuel (renewable energy) industries.

153,"Anammox bacteria were recently detected in soil samples collected from flooded taro fields on Oahu and in river and pond sediments on Kauai. As a previously unknown mechanism of anaerobic nitrogen (N) loss in agriculture, we propose to determine the impact of anammox in a flooded agricultural system. The goal of the project is to acquire a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving anaerobic N dynamics in flooded taro systems in Hawaii in order to improve N fertilizer management. The project has two objectives: 1) to determine the distribution of anammox in flooded taro soils of Hawaii and evaluate its contribution to N2 production, and 2) to determine the effects of different N fertilizer practices on anammox activity, N dynamics, and crop yield under flooded conditions. The project will test the following general hypothesis: anammox is ubiquitous in Hawaii taro soils and its activity is significantly affected by soil management practices and redox conditions. The results of this study will generally applicable to other flooded agricultural systems. To evaluate the effect of location, soil type and soil management practices on anammox distribution and activity in taro soils of Hawaii, triplicate soil cores will be collected at ten taro farms distributed across the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Oahu and Kauai. The quantity and identity of anammox bacteria within the soil will be assessed by quantitative PCR using anammox-specific primers and by DNA sequencing. Oxygen and NH4+, NO2- and NO3- profiles in soil cores will be used to identify depth increments where anammox activity is greatest. Rates of anammox activity will be quantified using an isotope pairing technique. We propose a 14-month on-farm trial where we test the effect of four N fertilizer treatments on anammox activity, N in the soil profile, N uptake, and taro yield. The treatments will consist of: (1) a control, the current practice of monthly broadcasts of granular urea into the floodwaters; (2) deep placement (10 cm below the soil surface) of urea super granules in three applications (1/3 pre-plant, 1/3 after 3 months, and 1/3 at 5 months), (3) a one-time application of polymer-coated, slow-release urea tilled in pre-plant, and (4) N-rich fish/bone meal tilled in pre-plant. We will monitor anammox activity by analyzing soil cores collected from the experimental plots 1, 4, and 10 months after planting. Outcomes of this project include: 1) a more complete understanding of the mechanisms responsible for N transformations in flooded soils, 2) validation of quantitative PCR as a robust measure of anammox abundance and activity in sediments, and 3) adoption of fertilizer strategies to increase N use efficiency in flooded systems. As approximately 154 million ha are in flooded rice production globally, where anammox may be an important, but now unrecognized, component of the N cycle, this project has significant implications for our understanding of both the N dynamics and management of these systems.

155," Slow slip events  have been discovered in subduction zones, including the Cascadia subduction zone in western North America, with precise Global Positioning System (GPS) networks.  These slip events displace the earth?s surface in a similar fashion to earthquakes, however instead of lasting seconds to minutes, they last days to weeks, and even years.  Because they occur so slowly, slow slip events do not radiate damaging seismic waves.  They appear to be located beneath the megathrust faults that generate magnitude 8 to 9 earthquakes.  Slow slip events in Cascadia occur fairly regularly every 10 to 16 months, and incrementally increase the stress on the locked fault zones.  It seems likely that slow slip events occur in a frictional transition zone between the locked and steadily creeping faults.  Therefore, understanding the occurrence of slow slip may lead to improved forecasting of damaging subduction zone earthquakes.  The physics of slow slip have remained poorly understood.  Theh investigators suggest that rate-state friction nucleates slip under drained (constant pore-pressure) conditions, but as slip accelerates and becomes effectively undrained (no flow), dilatancy induced pore-pressure reductions quench the instability.  Theystudy this, employing a simplified isothermal, membrane diffusion model and the Segall-Rice [1995] constitutive law for dilatancy. Numerical simulations exhibit either slow or fast (dynamic) slip depending on dilatancy and friction parameters, as well as effective normal stress. Stable slip is favored by low effective stress (high pore-pressure), consistent with seismically inferred vp/vs ratios in some slow-slip zones.   They will extend this work by developing finite difference calculations of fluid transport that will be coupled to the friction/elasticity simulations. Slow slip modeling must ultimately consider thermal, as well as frictional, weakening.   The researchers have shown that thermal pressurization becomes important at quasi-static slip speeds, before seismic radiation; the precise rates depend on permeability. This suggests that whether slip is fast or slow depends on whether or not dilatancy limits slip-rates   below thermal pressurization limits.  To investigate this requires coupling thermal and pore-fluid diffusion, with friction, elasticity, and dilatancy.  For slip that becomes fast compared to the characteristic diffusion time across the actively shearing layer, they must explicitly consider the finite thickness of the shear zone in the computations.  This work should shed significant light on the physics of slow slip, and the factors that ultimately control whether slip accelerates to inertially limited speeds characteristic of damaging earthquakes.

A recent genome-wide assessment of genetic diversity among twenty distinct varieties of rice (OryzaSNP set) resulted in the identification of over 150,000 polymorphic sites.  Given this array of genomic and genetic data, as well as the availability of advanced plant materials, rice is an excellent biological system for studying the complex interactions and genetic determinants controlling plant development traits in nature. This project is generating both global transcript profiles and metabolite fingerprints for phenotypically diverse and well-genotyped rice varieties. These datasets are being integrated with a variety of trait data using a holistic approach toward understanding the genes influencing biochemical processes that are integral to rice development. This project affords the Fellow training opportunities in computational methods for high throughput data analysis, database and website design, statistical genetic analyses and biochemical pathway modeling.  The fellowship increases the participation of underrepresented groups at the postdoctoral level and through mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. The extensive biochemical phenotyping of the OryzaSNP set is part of a larger effort to improve rice production and provide a comprehensive framework for systems biology studies in plants.

161,"TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis award supports theoretical research that is motivated by a key question in granular physics: how can one describe the statics and dynamics of dry granular media at large length scales and long time scales?The PI focuses on the nature of stress propagation near jamming. Our ability to predict and control the response of granular materials to external changes hinges on our ability to connect features such as force chains observed at short length scales to the large-scale deformation of granular media. Therefore, a theoretical framework that links the microscopic and collective behavior of grains has the potential of transforming the landscape of granular research.A property of granular materials that is responsible for most of the non trivial phenomenology, and leads to most of the theoretical challenges is the existence of a large number of different microscopic metastable states that are macroscopically equivalent. This feature is also present in a broader class of materials in their jammed states. Jamming, the transition from a fluid state to a disordered solid state is influenced by the presence of metastability, and granular materials exhibit strong fluctuations close to jamming. Experiments and simulations have shown that fluctuations in stresses, flow fields, and density have well defined distributions characterized by only a few external parameters. The existence of well-characterized distributions has led to notion of an underlying statistical description for granular media. Statistical ensembles analogous to those of equilibrium statistical mechanics have been proposed to create the desired link between microscopic and macroscopic, fluctuations and response. The PI will use a recently developed stress ensemble to make predictions about spatial fluctuations in static granular packings. The rheology of granular materials is also strongly affected by the existence of multiple, metastable states for a given set of macroscopic parameters. In recent work, the stress-ensemble, combined with a concept of metastability in a ?stress landscape? has been able to reproduce the logarithmic strengthening of granular materials under shear. A goal of the proposed project is to achieve better understanding of the dynamics of slowly deformed granular media using models that incorporate metastabilty, disorder and stochasticity.This project will provide valuable educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The PI has a strong record of including under-represented students and faculty in her research. The PI has also taken leadership roles in the complex fluids and granular community by founding and organizing workshops and conferences.NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis award supports theoretical research and education on granular materials and the phenomenon of jamming. The granular materials encountered in our daily lives, such as sand, salt, or rice, have remarkable properties. The cereal in the box compactifies when shaken, rice makes pyramidal structures only when poured out carefully, and sand flows at a constant rate in an hourglass. Failures of grain silos are caused by unpredictably large stresses exerted on the sidewalls as the flow arrests. Avalanches and earthquakes are examples of the unjamming of grains leading to flow. Yet, our grasp of such behavior of granular matter is limited. The main obstacle that hinders the understanding of granular matter is that it is fundamentally out of thermal equilibrium. Grains are macroscopic objects that interact through dissipative contact. The dissipative nature of the interactions implies that energy has to be constantly supplied to maintain a steady state. The macroscopic size makes thermal fluctuations irrelevant for changing the state of grains, and granular materials are effectively zero-temperature systems that do not equilibrate spontaneously. There is a growing realization that the study of granular media offers unexpected challenges in physics, having behavior unlike that of liquids or solids. The PI aims to develop a theoretical framework which captures the diverse phenomena displayed by granular materials. From a practical perspective, granular matter and emulsions are widespread, finding applications in the food industry, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and geomorphology. Often, the handling of granular materials is based on empirical methods due to a lack of understanding of these complex systems. A fundamental basis for these systems would make it possible to develop new procedures and reduce handling costs, thereby having a significant impact on industry and on American competitiveness.This project will provide valuable educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The PI has a strong record of including under-represented students and faculty in her research. The PI has also taken leadership roles in the complex fluids and granular community by founding and organizing workshops and conferences.

162,"This project will reconstruct patterns of systemic stress among prehistoric Middle-Final Jomon period (5000-2500 BP) foragers from Japan using incremental enamel microstructures (perikymata) found within and between linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) defects. Results will help explain the biological impact of subsistence diversity among foragers and provide a biocultural framework for interpreting the spread of wet rice economies across the Japanese Islands. Jomon foragers from western Japan occupied an environment of low resource density and consumed foods with poor nutritional yield compared to groups from eastern and northern regions. Wet rice economies were introduced and adopted in western Japan around 2500 BP, followed by diffusion to eastern regions around 2300 BP, but failure to spread northward. Greater prevalence of LEH defects and reduced stature are reported among Jomon foragers from western Japan. This suggests that agricultural diffusion may have been influenced by systemic stress patterning, though the more finite components of stress including chronology, duration, and periodicity are poorly understood. Five hypotheses predicting greater defect prevalence, earlier stress chronology, greater stress duration, reduced time intervals between defects, and seasonal stress patterning for western compared to eastern and northern Jomon people will be tested. High resolution silicone impressions were collected for more than 1200 teeth from more than 500 Middle-Final Jomon period individuals recovered from over 15 archaeological sites on Hokkaido and Honshu Islands. Tooth replicas will be fashioned from these impressions for microscopic analysis. Perikymata spacing and counts derived from microscopic analysis of tooth replicas will then be used to reconstruct chronology, duration, periodicity and prevalence of stress between regional Jomon samples.Several aspects of this study contain significant intellectual merit. First, this study highlights the relationship between environmentally mediated behavioral choices and systemic stress in a behaviorally diverse group of foragers. Second, this study helps explain the relationship between systemic stress and phenotypic variation (long bone length). Third, this research explores the relationship between behavior, cultural diffusion, and systemic stress. Broader impacts of this study are as follows: First, large, widely comparable data-sets will be disseminated on a professional webpage. In addition, data sets accumulated by this study will be used for educational purposes in the classroom, while equipment purchased by this study will provide graduate students access to technological resources that can be used to test independent research hypotheses. Finally, tooth replicas manufactured by this study can be used by other researchers interested in questions involving life history and dental anthropology.

163,"Many Americans lack even a rudimentary understanding of the principles underlying the technology essential for daily life. Engineering concepts are pervasive in decision making within industry, government, education, and health care; yet most decisions in these sectors are made by people with little or no formal engineering education. This research is taking first steps to develop a template for a Minor in Engineering Studies as an approach to developing technological competence in non-engineers. It is a collaboration involving Iowa State University, Ohio State University, Hope College, and Rice University that is building on promising but small-scale results achieved in the Minor in Engineering Studies Program at Iowa State University and building on engineering courses for nonmajors that are in place at the partner institutions. The Minor in Engineering Studies at Iowa State has attracted students majoring in business, communications, journalism, and design. A key question being investigated is whether a minor can be defined in terms of technological literacy skills rather than a set of common courses.  The ultimate goal is to develop a set of technological literacy objectives and outcomes for a Minor in Engineering Studies. These outcomes would be similar to the ABET a-k outcomes that are used for engineering degrees, but focused on developing technologically literate citizens rather than design engineers. The use of a standard set of outcomes rather than a standard series of courses would allow greater flexibility for each institution to develop a Minor in Engineering Studies that is best suited to its local conditions and existing courses (similar to the way engineering departments meet the ABET a-k requirements for engineering degrees). First steps entail establishing more clearly the value of an engineering minor, by determining student skills that result from current activities, and determining current students' and employers' perceived values of a minor in engineering.  This project will also develop and test a set of common assessment methods for desired technological literacy outcomes.  Developing the technological literacy outcomes and assessment methods simultaneously helps to insure that the outcomes are measurable and centered on student learning. Available assessment methods would facilitate the adoption of the outcomes by other engineering educators.  Built-in assessment will also keep participants focused on course design that reflects best practices in engineering teaching and learning.

The project will develop the next generation of subsurface imaging tools to significantly improve estimates of formation and property distributions, and to improve quantification of the corresponding predictive uncertainty to provide a sound basis for management or policy decisions.  A team of scientists and engineers with overlapping expertise in mathematics, statistics, modeling, and hydrogeology has been assembled from Stanford, Rice, Utah, and Boise State universities.  Theoretical and modeling developments will be combined with controlled experiments at a field-scale test facility (Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site, or BHRS) with three known scales of sedimentary structure and property variation, including layers and lenses with both high-contrast and gradational boundaries.  In particular, the research team will: (i) develop a firm mathematical foundation for the analysis of inverse problems (or imaging) under realistic assumptions about the completeness of measurements, including improved methods for representing complex systems; (ii) employ novel statistical tools that exploit recent advances and trends in computation; (iii) develop new analytical approaches for stochastic (or statistically uncertain) systems with realistic variability; (iv) combine these developments with experimental studies and independent evaluation of model performance against archive data sets available from BHRS; and (v) advance an emerging field method (hydraulic tomography) to acquire data sets for modeling 3D hydraulic conductivity distributions in aquifers.  Students and a post-doctoral scientist will work with senior researchers and will participate in all aspects of this project to gain cross-disciplinary knowledge and experience.  In addition to dissemination through peer-reviewed literature and professional meetings, the team will develop web-based tutorials and training sets with data and models from the project, and a short course on field and modeling methods from the project.

168,"The NSF Archaeology Program High Risk Exploratory Research competition will permit Dr. Anne Underhill (Field Museum) and her colleagues at Shandong University, China, to test 3-5 potential sites in the Rizhao area of southeastern Shandong province for excavation.  Through their systematic, regional survey for over a decade, Dr. Underhill and her Sino-American team located hundreds of settlements from the Longshan period, c. 2600-1900 B.C.. They identified a clear hierarchy with respect to the size of settlements and hypothesized that the site of Liangchengzhen, long known for its finely made pottery vessels and jade objects in an area over 100 hectares in size, was a regional center.  Mainly utilitarian pottery vessels and stone tools were found at the smaller settlements judged to be subsidiary to the political center at Liangchengzhen.  The team then excavated at Liangchengzhen from 1999-2001.  What remains unclear however is the nature of the interactions between people living in the regional center and those in the smaller, outlying communities.  By excavating a smaller settlement contemporary to and located near Liangchengzhen, the team aims to investigate the nature of social, economic, political, and ritual relations in the late prehistoric, Liangchengzhen polity.  The team will evaluate hypotheses about the emergence of urbanism, the nature of economic control (by means such as craft production and exchange) of smaller settlements by elites at Liangchengzhen, and mechanisms such as public rituals involving veneration of ancestors for social integration in the region.  Achieving this goal will require extensive testing of the buried Longshan deposits at the smaller settlement sites.  The team will work with local experts in probing and assessment of exposed profiles to identify buried residential areas dating to the Early and Middle phases of the Longshan period as at Liangchengzhen.  The ideal site to be chosen for eventual excavation will have evidence for houses and residential debris (production and consumption of pottery and stone objects, rice and other grains, domesticated animals, and ritual remains such as unusually large pits containing pots with residues for fermented beverages).  Since the sites to be tested were discovered by the team a decade ago, another task will be to assess the impact of modern farming and other activities on the buried deposits.  The field season also will be devoted to an initial study of resource distribution (such as clays) and changes to the regional landscape during and after the Longshan period.  This NSF funded project will enable the continuation of one of the longest Sino-foreign collaborative fieldwork, training, and publication programs.  The short testing phase will provide opportunities for archaeology students from the United States and Shandong University.  The opportunity to adequately assess the deposits at the candidate sites for their potential to yield the kinds of artifacts necessary to test the nature of interactions between settlements is essential for the success of the future excavation.  Few regional projects in China, home to one of the world's earliest civilizations, have involved studies of the range of possible hierarchical and horizontal relations between settlements and how polities developed prior to the establishment of the first literate dynasties.

169,"The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Jack Saltiel of Florida State University, who will study photochemical processes in the vitamin D field. He will investigate their medium dependence in order to resolve experimental discrepancies and to achieve the mechanistic understanding needed for theoretical advances. Photochemical and spectroscopic observations will be employed to characterize the photochemistry and photophysics of individual ground state conformers obtained by rotation about essential single bonds. The goal is to resolve composite responses into the individual responses of each molecular entity that contributes to the measured quantity. The research also involves synthesis of molecules designed to test theories on the photophysical and photochemical responses of organic molecules to light absorption. The research aims to provide the experimental foundation to gain a theoretical understanding of the behavior of electronically excited states.Broader impacts of the research are to understand the central role of the processes that trigger natural responses to light, as in vitamin D formation in the skin, in vision, and in photosynthesis. The theory of electronically excited states is a scientific frontier whose progress relies on valid experimental conclusions such as those provided by this research. Other broader impacts expected to result from the funded research are to continue the long and uninterrupted string of undergraduates who have prospered by participation in research with Professor Saltiel. For example, of the recent students, two have earned PhDs in biochemistry and biophysics from Rice and Stanford Universities; one student was an NSF Graduate Fellow at UC Berkeley and is now at Harvard Law School; two students are currently Biophysics graduate students at Caltech and Yale. With respect to gender, one female NSF graduate fellow in Biophysics now at Yale, was a freshman music major when she joined Professor Saltiel's research group.

170,"PI: Luca Comai (University of California, Davis)CoPI: Vladimir Filkov (University of California, Davis)Heterosis defines the increased vigor displayed by hybrid progeny compared to the inbred parents. Its molecular basis is not understood, except that genetic differences between parents are the likely cause. This work addresses the following hypothesis:  Hybrids suffer regulatory impairment because the parental contribution to regulatory complexes is mismatched in structure or amount. Relaxed regulation results in activation of pathways that cause enhanced growth . To test this hypothesis, RNA abundance, allelic contribution, and chromatin state will be investigated using hybrids of rice. The objectives are to: (i) compare the effect of evolutionary distance on parents and hybrid expression differences and parental expression preference; (ii) correlate expression changes to promoter activity and changes in repressive chromatin state, and (iii) examine the effects of hybridity on regulatory networks to determine if genes associated with growth are targets of hybrid misregulation. This analysis will entail a novel technology called cDNA-RESCAN to distinguish parental expression contributions at an effective cost, and will employ a bioinformatic and computational team for dissection of regulatory hierarchies. By exploring a specific hypothesis of heterosis, this work will provide important information on the overall regulatory effect of hybridity. Because the biological system is rice, the best understood grass genome and globally, the most important food crop, the acquired knowledge is likely to impact both our basic understanding of cellular function and the molecular understanding of pathways that may affect yield in wheat, maize and other critical crops for the US economy. Educational components of this research will involve training of undergraduates from local and from under-represented communities.

171,"The MCDB Database System for Managing and Modeling UncertaintyAnalysts working with large data sets often use statistical models to``guess'' at unknown, inaccurate, or missing information associatedwith the data stored in a database.  For example, an analyst for amanufacturer may wish to know,  What would my profits have been ifI'd increased my margins by 5% last year?  The answer to thisquestion depends upon the extent to which the higher prices would haveaffected each customer's demand, which is undoubtedly guessed via theapplication of some statistical model.The MCDB project is concerned with the design and implementation of aprototype database system called the  Monte Carlo Database System,  or MCDB  for short.  MCDB allows an expert-level analyst or statisticianto attach arbitrary stochastic models to the database data in order to guess  the values for unknown or inaccurate data, such as eachcustomer's unseen demand function.  These stochastic models reside inthe database, and are always up-to-date in the sense that they areparameterized on the current state of the database (using eachcustomer's most recent purchases in the above example).The project attacks a number of key intellectual and scientificchallenges.  Most of these are related to the fact that forperformance reasons, it is not possible to materialize one thousandstochastic instances of a one terabyte data warehouse, and query eachof them in sequence.  Novel methods for avoiding such materializationsare being considered, such as skipping Monte Carlo trials that producedata which will never be used to answer a specific query.  The projectalso considers statistical challenges, such as generating databaseinstances that fall far out in the tail of the answer distribution,which is necessary for specific applications such as risk assessment.Further information is available at http://mcdb.cs.rice.edu.

172,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).The ability of a scanning eye-safe aerosol lidar to measure the horizontal vector wind field in the atmospheric surface layer will be quantitatively evaluated. This will be done by calculating spatial correlation functions from elastic backscatter lidar scan images displaced in time. This method capitalizes on the wind-induced motion of aerosol features in the lidar?s scan imagery. The primary hypothesis is that the correlation technique will perform well during periods of sufficient turbulence intensity and may fail during periods of strong stability.  The hypothesis will be tested by comparing how well the wind vectors from the lidar and in situ anemometers located within the scanned region agree as a function of turbulence intensity and stability as measured by the instrumentation on a tower within the scanned region.In addition to testing the above hypothesis, the techniques refined and evaluated in the first part of the project will then be used for a comprehensive search for statistical relationships between perturbations in the lidar backscatter intensity data and turbulence variables measured in situ on the tower. The result will be a better understanding of the spatial distribution and evolution of phenomena such as turbulent coherent structures, fine-scale gravity waves, and the interplay between turbulence and waves during stable conditions. The processed data set, in the form of images and animations of backscatter and wind fields, will be made publicly available on a website.This research will have several broader impacts. It will form the nucleus of a new interdisciplinary research and education program at the California State University, Chico, where the NCAR REAL resides on long-term loan. Students from a variety of disciplines including physics, computer science, engineering, agriculture and health sciences will benefit from participation in this program. The lidar system and wind measurement capability will be available for other investigators and students to use as new applications for the system develop. The lidar system will be useful wherever there is a need to monitor and predict the dispersion of particulate or hazardous material in the atmosphere. Potential applications include: monitoring the air-shed around air quality sensors; tracking and predicting the dispersion of hazardous material in the atmosphere including releases from chemical and nuclear power plants; monitoring fugitive dust from mining operations; monitoring the application of pesticides over large agricultural areas; monitoring the emissions from agricultural sites such as intensive piggeries; monitoring smoke plumes from agricultural operations such as burning off rice and sugar cane fields; early warning of wildfires and predicting the speed and direction of the fire movement; and monitoring the plumes from industrial sites such as smelters and coal-fired power plants.

173,"PI: Lei Li (University of Virginia)Heterosis (hybrid vigor) refers to the phenomenon that progeny of diverse inbred parent exhibits superior traits to either of the two parents. This phenomenon has been extensively exploited in plant breeding and crop improvement. Although several genetic concepts have long been used to explain heterosis, they are not yet connected with molecular principles and thus offer limited mechanistic insight. The goal of this project is to investigate the role of microRNA-mediated gene circuits, which regulate many plant developmental processes, in heterosis in the rice plant. This work will utilize the rice genome sequences, high throughput experimental techniques, bioinformatic tools, and molecular techniques to examine 1) how microRNA-related polymorphisms between two parental rice strains contribute to differential gene expression in their hybrids, and 2) whether manipulation the expression levels of key microRNA genes impacts heterotic phenotypes. Through this project, a set of microRNA genes and their target genes involved in heterosis will be identified. Knowledge gained from this research should provide a framework necessary to understand the role of microRNA-mediated molecular events in the expression of heterosis and thus a foundation for further engineering the phenomenon in crop improvement. The broader impacts of this project stem in part from the yield advantage and other superior traits of hybrid-based crop production. Understanding the contribution of microRNA-regulated gene circuits to heterosis in the model plant rice is of great importance to food security worldwide. A comprehensive set of experimentally tested microRNA genes in rice will be made available to the public through established microRNA databases (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/) and rice annotation databases (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/). Such information will provide new insights into microRNA-mediated gene regulation and add to our general knowledge of plant genome expression and regulation. Given that rice is a model for the grass species, information obtained from this project should facilitate comparative genomics studies aimed at tracing evolution of microRNA-regulated gene circuits in other food, feed and energy crops. The broader impacts of this project also include excellent training opportunities in the interdisciplinary field of plant genomics and bioinformatics. By blending classroom lectures with computational experimentation, information generated from this project will be particularly useful to encourage undergraduate students to actively participate in independent research. base; Bioinformatics; Breeding; comparative genomics; Databases; Developmental Process; Engineering; Event; Evolution; Exhibits; feeding; Food; food security; Foundations; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; genome sequencing; Genomics; Goals; Hybrid Vigor; Hybrids; Inbreeding; insight; Knowledge; lectures; Mediating; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Molecular; Parents; Phenotype; Plant Genome; Plant Model; Plants; Poaceae; Production; Regulation; Research; Rice; Role; stem; Students; Techniques; Testing; Tissue-Specific Gene Expression; tool; Training; trait; Universities; Virginia; WorkROLE OF MICRORNA-RELATED POLYMORPHISMS IN REGULATING HETEROTIC GENE EXPRESSION",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06
174,"This U.S. - South America proposal will support one junior and three senior researchers from the U.S., under the direction of Dr. Peter Maughan, to participate in a set of planning visits to Bolivia, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. The objective of these planning visits is to identify priorities for the utilization and development of genomic tools for the major New World orphaned crops species [e.g., quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus and A. cadatus), tarwi (Lupinus mutabilis), yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus), cañahua (Chenopodium pallidacule), oca (Oxalis tuberosa), and mashwa (Tropaeolum tuberosum)].  Genetic resources, such as DNA sequence-based genetic markers, genetic linkage maps, and gene libraries are essential tools for understanding and improving the genetic basis of agriculturally important traits in crop plants.  The use of DNA markers and gene manipulation (including genetic modification and transgenics) are now commonly used in combination with traditional breeding methods to accelerate and enhance varietal development of the major food staples.  Unfortunately, many regionally important crop species (commonly referred to as orphan crops) lag far behind the major commodity crops (maize, soybean, wheat, rice, etc.) in terms of the development of these advanced genetic tools due to their status as minor crops in the U.S and Europe.  In addition to their regional importance as food and feed crops, these species are also of interest to the broader community of plant scientists due to their remarkable adaptation to severe environments and exceptional nutritional qualities.  The work will be done in collaboration with Jorge Rojas-Beltran of the Fundación PROINPA, Cochabamba, Bolivia; Ivan Maureira Butler of the National Agriculture Research Institute, Carillanca, Chile; Luz Gomez Pando of the National Agricultural University La Molina, Lima, Peru; and Eduardo Peralta of the Instituto Nacional Autónomo de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, Quito, Ecuador.

180,"This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009 and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Angelia Seyfferth is  Physiological Mechanisms Underlying Arsenic Uptake and Transformation in Field-Grown Rice (Oryza sativa L.).  The research and training supported by this fellowship is being conducted at Stanford University under the sponsorships of Drs. Scott Fendorf, Devaki Bhaya, and Peter Vitousek.It is feared that arsenic (As) contamination of groundwaters in southern and southeastern Asia is causing the largest exposure in human history where more than 140 million people are drinking water with hazardous levels of arsenic.  Exposure to arsenic through consumption of rice irrigated with this contaminated groundwater may be of equal or greater importance than exposure through drinking water, particularly for populations that rely on rice for sustenance.  Plants do not deal with the various chemical forms of arsenic in the same way.  Therefore, it is important to understand the different mechanisms of entry into rice roots and subsequent translocation toward the edible grain.  Which chemical form is predominant in the rhizosphere of field-grown rice and within different plant fractions is presently unresolved.  The overall goal of this research project is to elucidate the predominant mechanism of arsenic uptake, accumulation, and in planta transformation within field-grown rice utilizing both X-ray absorption spectroscopy and mass-balance with radiolableled arsenic.    The specific training objectives are to gain field experience at the interface of biology, chemistry, geology, and environmental science and to learn new analytical tools and techniques to achieve the stated scientific goals.

181,"PI: Daniel F. Voytas (University of Minnesota)CoPIs: Drena L. Dobbs (Iowa State University), J. Keith Joung (Massachusetts General Hospital), Jennifer Kuzma (University of Minnesota) and Kan Wang (Iowa State University) Plants have remarkable biosynthetic capacities that can be harnessed to produce compounds of value for food, fuel, medicine and industry. Fully realizing the biosynthetic potential of plants, however, requires sophisticated tools to manipulate plant genomes.  Specifically, it is desirable to make precise alterations to the plant genetic code, including DNA insertions, deletions and substitutions.  Such precise modifications can be made through a process known as gene targeting or homologous recombination.  Fundamentally, gene targeting is a DNA swapping reaction:  a DNA fragment carrying a desired sequence is introduced into a plant cell, and it replaces the native copy of the gene.   To enhance the efficiency of gene targeting, a chromosome break is created at the site of modification (the target).  An enzyme called a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) is used to generate the chromosome break.  ZFNs have two components: a DNA recognition domain (a zinc finger array) and a nuclease that cleaves the chromosome.  Zinc finger arrays can be designed to recognize diverse DNA sequences, thereby making it possible to modify any chromosomal target.  Current research is directed at developing zinc finger nuclease-assisted gene targeting for widespread use in plants, including establishing key parameters for high frequency gene modification and robust methods for the design of zinc finger arrays.  The project focuses on implementing gene targeting in rice, arguably the world's most important food crop.  The outcome of the research will be a highly facile gene targeting system that can be employed in a variety of plant species.  Because gene targeting introduces changes in plant genomes in a highly specific and controlled manner, crops generated through gene targeting may be met with greater public acceptance than traditional genetically modified crops.  An efficient method for making precise modifications to plant genomes (gene targeting) is critical for detailed functional analysis of genes and genetic pathways.  Gene targeting will also enable the development of new crop varieties, including those that better withstand pests, have enhanced food value, and produce compounds of industrial importance.  Gene targeting differs fundamentally from transgenesis in that the resulting plant material may only have a single or few nucleotide changes that distinguish it from the parent.  This precision suggests that gene targeting may mitigate some concerns about the use of genetically modified crops, which has limited the application of genetic engineering to plant agriculture.  The project specifically explores the potential societal impacts of gene targeting.  In addition, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students for work in plant molecular biology, computational biology and public policy.  This diversity of research topics provides a rich interdisciplinary training environment and a unique opportunity for all project participants to learn about the impact of science on society.

182,"Abstract for DMS - 0905909Singularity Behavior in Some Geometric Variational Problems Robert Hardt  (Rice University)This project lies in the area of geometric calculus of variations, which treats the formation and behavior of singularities and concentration structures for various optimal or stationary functions, fields, measures, or geometric structures, possibly subject to constraints.  The first specific class of projects involves continuing work with T. Riviere, on relations between the pth power  energy of a map between Riemannian manifolds and its homotopy class.   In various higher dimensional cases, energy concentration of limits of smooth mappings  to a manifold may produce new geometric topologically nontrivial objects and is related to the nonvanishing homotopy of the manifold. This concentration behavior corresponding to any nontorsion homotopy invariant can now be described, and bubbling related to torsion invariants is being investigated for  variational problems.   We also are attacking higher order Sobolev  spaces which seem more natural for certain homotopy classes, but for which basic approximation results and constructions have not been  previously studied.  Work with Thierry De Pauw involves the study of   chains, cochains, charges, and the higher dimensional calculus of  variations in general metric spaces with general coefficient groups.   We consider a variety of mass-type functionals and the notion of a flat chain which generalizes the finite mass metric-space currents of Ambrosio-Kirchheim and the rectifiable and flat Euclidean-space G- chains of B.White. Semi-algebraic maps, chains, forms, and various structures generalized from geometric measure theory continue proving useful in work with Pascal Lambrechts on the topology of algebraic varieties, including the real homotopy theory. Also metric properties of varieties are  to be approached using special classes of metric chains and cochains.  Other studies include microstructure computation, combined transport-shape problems with applications to imaging, and the existence and regularity of optimal trusses.Solutions to many variational problems in both pure and applied mathematics often are forced to have singularities, that is, to involve regions where large oscillations occur.  For example a nematic liquid crystal material in a spherical container whose optical axis is forced to point outward on the container necessarily will have singularities inside (observable through cross-polarizers or x-ray diffraction).  In this example the optical axis has an energy density, which measures its local rate of change and whose integral tends to have a minimum value among all possible configurations. Our research proposes to understand the relationship between energies in such variational problems and the topological barriers imposed by the physics of these problems.  We have derived new notions which allow the treatment and precise geometric and analytic description of a wide variety of problems from soap films (which locally minimize area) and their higher dimensional  generalizations to optimal transport paths in various complex media.   The goal in these applications of geometric calculus of variations is to develop sufficient mathematical tools to model, compute, and predict physical behavior.  Geometric constraints which occur naturally in many physical problems have led to new mathematical and computational issues.  In particular, three that we are now studying involve flow problems in image processing,  microstructure formation in certain crystalline materials, and geometric analysis of large data sets. abstracting; Area; Behavior; Calculi; Charge; Complex; Data Set; energy density; Film; Goals; Image; image processing; liquid crystal; Maps; Mathematics; Measures; Metric; Modeling; Optics; Physics; Property; Research; Rice; Shapes; Soaps; Solutions; Structure; theories; tool; Trusses; Universities; Variant; WorkSINGULARITY BEHAVIOR IN SOME GEOMETRIC VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1.727438994546943e-06,1e-06,1e-06

Cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice and barley are most affected by drought during the time of flowering and initiation of grain formation, causing drastic yield losses. The goal of this project is to develop a systems biology view of drought responses in cereals to understand this complex process and improve drought resistance and water use efficiency. Genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis of drought responses in rice and maize will be integrated into a cereal drought gene interaction network, using ortholog information to predict conserved functional relationships as a basis for cereals. Conserved orthologous regulatory genes between rice and maize involved in drought responses and resistance will be identified comprising transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases and phosphatases, genes in hormone signaling pathways, chromatin binding proteins, protein degradation and small RNA pathways. As proof of principle, a set of these putative conserved rice and maize genes will be tested by genetic analysis of mutants and natural allelic variants, assessing them for altered drought response phenotypes and perturbation in the drought gene interaction network. These analyses will validate and improve the cereal gene interaction network predictions, and provide candidate genes for improvement of drought resistance/tolerance in cereals. With respect to broader impacts, this project will contribute through the generation of information key to the development of stable food production systems worldwide and through the creation of a transdisciplinary educational environment. Scientifically, the project will demonstrate the use of an integrated network approach to understand complex plant responses such as drought response and resistance. Outreach and training activities are integrated within the transdisciplinary plant-lab-bioinformatics project and will be made accessible to high school and underrepresented undergraduate students from institutions across Virginia and North Carolina through established programs at Virginia Tech and other nearby universities. An outreach program developed as part of a NSF-Cyberinfrastructure Training, Education, Advancement, and Mentoring for Our 21st Century Workforce (CI-TEAM) project will provide modules for quantitative data analysis for teachers and students using socio-environmental case studies from research data. An integrated mentor program for postdoctoral researchers will be used to facilitate career development. International research collaborations with the Generation Challenge Program and CGIAR institutes involved in drought research will add capacity building to agricultural systems worldwide.  Plant genotypes and all data developed in the project will be made available through a project website (http://cereal-drought.vbi.vt.edu/) that will allow interactive access to data and networks. Other publicly available genetic stocks used will be distributed by the respective originators with long term public repositories.

184,"Computer Science (31) This project aspires to transform how college students learn robotics by offering a motion planning curriculum that enhances deep learning and is supported by an integrated software environment. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in (a) developing an extensible software tool for teaching motion planning to college students, (b) promoting a robotics curriculum while examining its effectiveness for diverse learners at three institutions, and (c) engaging a broader spectrum of faculty and students in the emerging user community in developing motion planning technology and user practices. This work leads to a new way of teaching robotics courses by building on prior knowledge of calculus and programming, and providing hands-on experiences with state-of-the-art planners. Students work on challenging problems, and develop deeper knowledge by reflecting on and formally evaluating their results. This project offers students hands-on experience with state-of-the-art planners, teaches them how to compare them, modify them, and build challenging applications. The intention is to scaffold learning by freeing students from tedious details and heavy programming and help them through a hands-on problem-based learning approach to develop critical thinking within robotics and outside robotics.The broader impact of this proposal is implemented through a number of coordinated activities. Documentation and assignments that have been tested in the robotics classes are shared through the Rice Connexions Project and the National Science Digital Library so that they can be used by other robotics instructors. The efforts to develop a collaborative user community also helps in this direction, providing support to the instructors who choose to use the material in their courses and encouraging feedback and discussion of teaching practices among users through online communication technology. Students who participate in robotics clubs at universities and high-schools are asked to review and give feedback on the materials and the software environment. In the long run the software environment developed with this proposal can be used with younger students to motivate them to pursue careers in computer science and engineering fields.

Eisen (University of California - Davis)Collaborators: Venu Kalavacharla (Delaware State University) and Gurdev Khush (University of California - Davis)Plants grow in close association with large communities of microbes collectively called the microbiome.  Comparatively little is known about the diversity of microbes that associate with plants and their interactions and effects on performance and crop yields. Specific microbes have been extensively documented to provide beneficial effects to plants, such as those involving well-known symbiotic associations in legumes.  Previous studies utilizing a single beneficial bacterial species in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrate how plants actively recruit beneficial bacteria under biotic stress regimes.  While valuable insights can be gained from studies with single microbial species, preliminary studies show a wide diversity of bacterial species associated with field grown rice (Oryza sativa) plants, whose biological significance is completely unknown.  This project will utilize a combination of genomic and metagenomic approaches to dissect the impact of microbial associations on rice.  Specifically, a controlled experimental system will be established, in which microbial populations will be characterized by metagenomic rRNA profiling, and plant responses by transcriptomic profiling. The expression profiles for localized and whole plant responses will be analyzed for global changes in gene expression, as well as for changes in the expression of specific functional classes of genes that would reflect changes in nutrient availability, or establishment of plant immunity. The proposed research will provide the foundations for future investigations into the impact of the microbiome on plant performance.  All sequence and mapping data generated in this project will be accessible through a genome browser that will be developed specifically for this project.  Allsequence data will be deposited for long-term dissemination in GenBank, GreenGenes (http://greengenes.lbl.gov), the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and NCBI's Short Read Archive (SRA; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/home/).   The broader impacts of this project stem, in part, from the interdisciplinary nature of the research.  Training for students and postdoctoral associates will integrate quantitative approaches with applications to experimental biology. The project will also have broader impacts in the professional development and educational arenas. Professionally, the students and postdoctoral researcher involved in this project will benefit from experimental design training, the acquisition of technical expertise and interdisciplinary communication. In addition, the project will conduct a robust internship program for outstanding students from Delaware State University (DSU), an 1890 Historically Black University, and Delaware Technical & Community College (DTCC), a two-year institution with substantial numbers of first-generation college and minority students.

186," This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009(Public Law 111-5). Customizable Domain-Specific ComputingTo meet ever-increasing computing needs and overcome power density limitations, the computing industry has entered the era of parallelization, with tens to hundreds of computing cores integrated into a single processor; and hundreds to thousands of computing servers connected in warehouse-scale data centers. However, such highly parallel, general-purpose computing systems still face serious challenges in terms of performance, energy, heat dissipation, space, and cost. In this project we look beyond parallelization and focus on domain-specific customization as the next disruptive technology to bring orders-of-magnitude power-performance efficiency improvement to important application domains. The intellectual merit of this project includes development of a general methodology for creating novel customizable architecture platforms and the associated compilation tools and runtime management environment to support domain-specific computing to: 1) achieve orders-of-magnitude computing efficiency improvement for applications in a specific domain; and 2) demon-strate that such improvement can be obtained with little or no impact on design productivity, so that it can be deployed in a wide range of application domains. Our proposed domain-specific customizable computing platform includes: 1) a wide range of customizable computing elements, from heterogeneous fixed cores to coarse-grain customizable cores, and to fine-grain field-programmable circuit fabrics; 2) customizable high-performance radio frequency interconnects; 3) highly automated compilation tools and runtime management software systems for application development; and 4) a general, reusable methodology for customizable computing applicable across different domains. By combining these critical capabilities, we shall deliver a super-computer-in-a-box that is customized to a particular application domain to enable disruptive innovations in that domain. This approach will be demonstrated in several important application domains in healthcare. The broader impact of this project will be measured by the new digital revolution enabled by customized computing. We will demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed research in the domain of healthcare, given its significant impact on the national economy and quality of life issues. In particular, we focus our effort on revolutionizing the role of medical imaging and hemodynamic modeling in healthcare, providing much more cost-efficient, convenient solutions for preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures to dramatically improve healthcare quality, efficiency, and patient outcomes. The broader impact of this project also includes the integration of research and education, exposing graduate, undergraduate, and high school stu-dents to the new concepts and research from this project via several new courses jointly developed and shared by researchers in our newly established Center for Domain-Specific Computing (CSDC). Summer research fellowship programs to support high school and undergraduate students will be provided by CSDC. Our goal is to train a new generation of students who are prepared for customized parallelization and computing, and can effectively apply such techniques to many areas of our society, thus furthering the digital revolution. Special efforts are being made to attract underrepresented students at all levels via partnerships with campus organizations focused on diversity, such as the UCLA Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity.This research will be carried out as a collaborative effort between four universities: UCLA (the lead institution), Rice, UC Santa Barbara, and Ohio State.

188,"This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2009. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Mary M. Guisinger is  Using plant plastid genomes as the model system to develop bioinformatic tools for characterizing genome evolution.  This research is being conducted at the University of California-Berkeley under the sponsorships of Drs. Chelsea Specht and Rasmus Nielsen. Biology is moving into the post-genomics era.  In the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of genome data pubicly available; however, this has led to a bottleneck in terms of analyses. Over 100 land plant plastid (chloroplast) genomes are currently available on GenBank, and this is largely due to their relatively small size, conserved nature, and the development of inexpensive, high-throughput sequencing methods. Crop plants, especially members of the plant order Poales (including the grasses, i.e. wheat, maize, rice, oats, sorghum, sugarcane, and barley), have received particular attention. Several plant nuclear genomes have been sequenced, including rice, and projects are in progress to sequence six additional grass nuclear genomes. Ongoing genome sequencing projects promise to provide an avalanche of data available for researchers. This project is creating tools to automate the examination of rates and patterns of genome evolution using the Poales as a model system. Plastid genome data provide a densely sampled and phylogenetically resolved framework for developing and testing these new methods. The training objectives include developing computational and programming skills and enhancing the understanding of molecular evolution, plant biology, and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include utilizing an interdisciplinary approach leading to collaboration with researchers in the fields of biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics.

189,"Oomycete and fungal plant pathogens cause a number of very important diseases. Many of these pathogens can deliver proteins into the cytoplasm of their host cells to disable host immunity; these proteins are called effectors. The mechanism by which these proteins enter host cells is poorly understood. The investigators have shown that oomycete and fungal effector proteins can enter host cells without the aid of any pathogen-encoded machinery, but instead rely on short amino acid sequences in the N-termini called RXLR motifs. The investigators have discovered that the RXLR motifs can bind a class of membrane lipids called phosphoinositides. In this project, the investigators will test whether binding of the effectors to phosphoinositides is actually responsible for transferring the effectors into host cells. They will identify which host phosphoinositides are utilized by the effectors, and they will characterize the mechanism of binding. Finally they will test whether it is possible to block effector entry and so prevent disease. An extremely wide range of the most destructive plant pathogens, including those causing wheat rust, rice blast, grape powdery mildew and potato late blight depend on effectors. Understanding effector entry and determining how to block it would provide an entirely new approach to treating this broad class of diseases. Treatment of animal diseases caused by fungi, oomycetes and some parasites may also be treatable by this approach.

The structure-function relationships will be determined for the macromolecules and biopolymers in their active form. In particular, the research will focus on the activation of adhesion in von Willebrand factor (VWF), the largest multimeric adhesion ligand circulating in blood, which is activated by shear stress to function as a molecular glue to bind platelets. The objectives of the research are to:  (1) Characterize mechanical resistance to domain unfolding of VWF.  The PI will determine whether disufide bonds are responsible for the lateral association, hence the fiber formation, of ultra large VWF and sheared VWF.  The focus here will be on the mechanical resistance of  VWF unfolding to external stretching force. (2) Quantify platelet binding kinetics. Through a single-molecule AFM pulling experiment, the PI will determine the kinetic rate and free energy of plasma VWF binding with glycoprotein (GP) Ib-alpha before and after shear exposure and under  flow conditions. These data will quantify activation of the molecular glue by shear.  (3) Investigate the viscoelastic and free energies of mesoscopic VWF fibers. We will use thermal fluctuations and dynamically imposed oscillations in the pulling schedule to measure the viscoelastic properties and free energies of VWF, sheared VWF, and ultra large VWF.BROADER IMPACTS:  The proposed research will advance knowledge on the mechanism of activation of VWF, a shear-activated molecular glue important in blood clotting. The lessons learned from nature may help to derive strategies for synthesis of functional smart biopolymers. For the broad society, understanding the blood clotting mechanism, which plays an important role in the blood interactions with biomaterials surfaces, may help people with synthetic devices such as heart valve implants, people with bleeding disorders, and thrombic wound treatment.  Experimental findings will be incorporated into the PI?s new undergraduate level course, Introduction to Biological Physics, and a graduate level course, Topics in Biological Physics. Students and postdoctoral associates will have the opportunity to use the state-of-the art instrument for biological physics research. A computer program developed in this project will be used to advance the usefulness of AFM instrumentation. Outreach activities include serving as mentor for the Rice Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program through the Rice Quantum Institute (RQI), for the Keck Undergraduate Research Training Program (URTP) through the W. M. Keck Center for Computational and Structural Biology, and for participants in the summer undergraduate research program in HHMI Bionanotechnology at Rice University. Students are recruited from physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering disciplines that have interests in moving into biologically-oriented research.

191,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).The objective of this research is to design and prototype mobile wireless hardware that retains high energy efficiency across a broad performance range.  The approach is to systematically address the inefficiency in multiple layers of wireless hardware.  Wireless hardware is conventionally optimized for delivering peak performance; the energy efficiency reduces drastically as the achieved performance decreases.  The key methodology is to design scalable hardware and judiciously scale it according to the bottleneck.With respect to intellectual merit, this project targets four engineering contributions.  First, the resource demands of wireless traffic are modeled to design adaptive policies that jointly optimize rate adaption and power management.  Second, wireless detection architectures are developed that can scale properly based on the data rate and power requirements, and integrate with the higher levels in the wireless system.  Third, configurable decoder architectures are developed that dynamically adjust the decoder in a fine-grain manner.  Fourth, using the Rice WARP platform, the proposed technologies are implemented into a complete functional wireless hardware system to evaluate the solutions under a wide range of wireless applications.With respect to broader impact, the multidisciplinary collaboration with health scientists in preventive health care has the potential for contribution to societal needs.  The collected data, the research evaluation platform, and educational content are to be made open-source and on-line.  Ongoing collaboration with industry leaders, including Texas Instruments and Nokia, assist the transfer of technologies into future mobile wireless hardware.

192,"University of Georgia graduate student Susannah Chapman, with the guidance of Dr. Virginia Nazarea, will undertake research on how traditional subsistence farmers conceive of property in seeds and plants.  Over the past two decades, the privatization of crop varieties through intellectual property rights law under the World Trade Organization has sparked a number of debates concerning Farmers' Rights, access to plant resources, benefit sharing, and cross-cultural concepts of property in plants and associated knowledge.  To investigate how farmers conceptualize property rights in plants, Chapman will undertake research in the Lower River Division of The Gambia, where farmers cultivate rice and millet for household subsistence and commercial sale.  The study draws on a wide range of historic and ethnographic methods including archival research, semi-structured and life history interviews, seed network analysis, and focus groups to determine how farmers conceive of property in seeds and how farmers access different crop varieties.  In particular, this research explores the concepts of value, exchange and access as they relate to farmers' management of crop resources in The Gambia.  These three concepts are central to studies in property theory and common resource management research.  Understanding how these concepts relate to seed systems will enable a more nuanced investigation of ideas such as private ownership, public goods, and open access concerning seeds and associated knowledge.This study will contribute to social science theory on traditional legal processes that are not articulated through conflict resolution.  In this sense, the project enables greater understanding of the relationships between customary and codified legal systems common in many parts of the world today. A better understanding of farmers' own systems for owning, accessing, valuing and exchanging crop varieties will also contribute to improving state and international law for intellectual property rights.

193,"Strawberry fruit production has significant economic value for US farmers.  Knowledge that can lead to an increase in strawberry fruit size and number, improvement in fruit color, shape, and taste, and to added nutritional and pharmaceutical value will enhance our nation's economic competitiveness. Information gained from studying fruit development in existing reference plants, such as Arabidopsis, rice or maize, is difficult to apply to strawberry because strawberry flowers and fruits have unique structures and complex chemical communications between the seed-bearing ovary called the achene and the fleshy stem, the fruit. This project will describe molecular, hormonal, and morphological events, in specific cell types and individual tissue types, during floral organ and fruit development. The project will use the most modern technology and a diploid strawberry species, Fragaria vesca that is easily worked with in the laboratory.  With the resources and information thus generated, genes with roles in achene ripening and genes that regulate signaling/communications between achene and fruits will be identified and characterized, taking advantage of the recently completed genome sequencing of F. vesca.  The project will provide fundamental molecular and physiological insights into the signaling and communication events between achenes and the fruit. Such insights will enable future agricultural manipulation to control seed maturation, fruit growth, and fruit ripening, which underlie strawberry's reproductive success and adaptation to the changing environment.Broader impacts.  The resources generated by the project include next generation sequencing data for 36 stage and tissue specific samples representing reproductive development, annotations of a large number of strawberry genes, discovery of novel strawberry genes, identification of cell-, tissue-, and stage-specific messenger RNAs, and useful tools for monitoring hormone levels and dynamics. Because Strawberry belongs to the Rosaceae family, which contains many economically important tree and woody perennial fruits (peach, apple, and raspberry) and nuts, as well as ornamental and wood crops, the project will help establish the diploid strawberry as a model for studying other herbaceous perennials as well as other Rosaceae species.  In addition to community resources, the project will contribute to the understanding of fundamental questions about reproductive development, hormonal cross-talk, organ-to-organ signaling, and tissue-to-tissue signaling.  The project will also provide interdisciplinary training opportunities that are integral to the research plan to undergraduate students from a local HBCU and two state universities.  A bioinformatics summer workshop will be offered to high school teachers from inner city Baltimore to encourage quantitative thinking in high school students. Two postdoctoral fellows will follow a career development plan that encourages independent thinking, communications, and student mentoring.

Prof. Killian's research group atRice University in Houston, Texas will develop new techniques formanipulating atom-atom interactions using lasers, which are much moreflexible and may open the way to new applications such as laser beamsmade of atoms instead of light, or the ability to make new states of matter.This work will also involve at least two graduate students and oneundergraduate student, and it will train them for high-technologycareers in optics or materials. The ultracold atomic physics laboratoryat Rice also has a partnership with the Houston campus of Yes Prep HighSchool, a highly successful charter school targeting disadvantagedyouth. This collaboration brings high school students into thelaboratory for term-time visits and summer camps, and introduces them tothe excitement of science at the frontiers of discovery in hopes ofinspiring them to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathcareers.

195,"Gibberellin (GA) is an important plant growth hormone, which promotes seed germination, leaf expansion, stem elongation and flower development in higher plants.  The dwarf cultivars of wheat and rice developed during the Green Revolution in the 60s remarkably increased the grain yields.  Recent studies revealed that these cultivars are modified in their GA production or responses to GA, illustrating the important role of this hormone in regulating plant development and in agriculture.  GA-promoted growth and development is modulated by DELLA proteins, which are major negative regulators (repressors) of GA responses.  Recent work in the PI's laboratory (funded by NSF) has made transforming findings that the GA receptor directly targets DELLA for degradation.  There is also evidence suggesting multiple layers of regulation on the DELLA protein activity.  DELLA is a master growth repressor, which integrates not only the GA signal, but also other hormone signals as well as biotic and abiotic signals (such as light conditions, pathogens, cold and drought stresses).  Although DELLA plays such a pivotal role in regulating plant growth, very little is known about how DELLA activity is regulated.  Preliminary data support that protein modifications play important roles in modulating DELLA function.  Future research in this project will elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. Broader Impacts:DELLA proteins are functionally highly conserved in Arabidopsis and in many crop plants.  For example, the semi-dwarf wheat cultivars, an essential component of the Green Revolution, contain mutations in the Rht loci that encode DELLA proteins.  This study will likely to have a broader impact in improving quality of agricultural crops.  In addition, a postdoctoral fellow and four undergraduate students will gain research experience in this project.  The findings of this study will be incorporated into three undergraduate courses at Duke University.  Students will learn to appreciate how the information gained from studies in a model plant system can be used to improve agriculture practice and benefit society.

196,"Plant pathogenic fungi are responsible for major crop losses.  To infect their hosts many fungi, including Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast and the most destructive fungal disease of rice worldwide, have evolved to form a specialized infection cell, an appressorium.  Appressorium formation is regulated by signal transduction pathways notably the cAMP and MAP kinase pathways, which results in activation of phosphorylation cascades leading to changes in gene expression, including genes involved in protein turnover.  However, knowledge of these post-translational protein modifications and dynamic changes in proteins during appressorium formation is limited.  The ability to conduct large scale analyses of proteins in living cells as well as measure changes in protein modifications has advanced dramatically in recent years.  In this project, to further define and characterize the processes regulating appressorium formation, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of relative changes in protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns during appressorium formation will be conducted.  The integration of gene expression and proteomics data will contribute substantially to constructing a more comprehensive view of the cellular processes underlying this fundamental biological process.Broader Impacts: This project will have broad impact at several levels.  The research will provide cross training in chemistry and fungal biology for the graduate student and post doctoral scholar involved in this project.  An individualized mentoring program will be developed for the post doctoral scholar.  The PI and co-PI will develop a new colloquium integrating general concepts in biology and chemistry around the premises of this project for high school students as well as provide research experience for undergraduates.  Finally, through broad dissemination of the results from these studies, including an online open-source database, the knowledge will be invaluable for driving research to find practical solutions to rice blast and other diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens.

197,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).River inputs play a significant role in the geochemistry of the global oceans. Rivers provide a significant source of nutrients, organic matter and suspended sediment to coastal shelves and the open ocean. The delivery of high nutrient loads to coastal areas can increase primary production, which will further increase the amount of organic carbon delivered to marine sediments. Understanding the amount, as well as the chemistry, of the terrestrial materials delivered from rivers to the ocean is essential to comprehend both the current and future patterns of carbon burial in ocean sediments. It is recognized that watersheds located in tropical and subtropical developing regions play an increasingly important role in river nutrient release, and to predict the human impact on coastal and global ocean processes, it is important to understand the impacts of the developing regions of the globe. Researchers from Rice University will study a suite of Venezuelan rivers to characterize the effects of developing-world land use practices on river nutrients, organic carbon, and total suspended solid inputs to the ocean. Correlating an impact and land use index with the chemistry of exported materials, will provide clarification on the relationship between land use and the mass and composition of the riverine material delivered to the ocean. The results from this research will also provide a better overall understanding of the global marine carbon cycle.  This research is being done as a collaborative effort between United States and Venezuelan scientists and will provide support for two PhD students.

198,"Scientific MeritThe gibberellins are a large group of complex diterpenoid natural products, among which several have potent biological activity in plants, where they serve as hormones. Intriguingly, these phytohormones are made not only by the plants in which they serve to regulate growth and development, but by certain plant-associated fungal and bacterial microbes as well. While gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis has been largely elucidated for higher plants and fungi, which seem to have independently evolved/assembled the corresponding metabolic pathway, the basis for such biosynthesis in bacteria remains enigmatic. Even in higher plants, the origins of gibberellin metabolism remains obscure. Further, there have been recent discoveries demonstrating the existence of novel gibberellin metabolism (particularly catabolism) in higher plants, which have unexplored implications in plant biology. Building on previous NSF-supported studies, this project will both further investigate gibberellin metabolism in higher plants and also define the analogous biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. The bacterial pathway appears to represent yet a third example of a convergent evolutionary solution to the puzzle presented by such complex natural products biosynthesis. These studies will also provide insight into the evolutionary origins of gibberellin metabolism in plants. Thus, the planned wide-ranging studies will provide a comprehensive overview of gibberellin phytohormone metabolism in a phylogenetically diverse group organisms. Gibberellins have played an important role in agriculture, as it was alterations in such phytohormone metabolism that led to high yielding semi-dwarf varieties of rice and wheat, which were a critical component of the  Green Revolution . The biosynthesis of gibberellin phytohormones by plant growth promoting bacteria that are commonly applied to legume crop plants offers additional agricultural significance. Further, the absolute requirement for gibberellin production in higher plants has provided a genetic reservoir of biosynthetic genes, duplication of which has led to a vast super-family (~7,000 known) of related diterpenoid natural products, exhibiting various biological activities and physiological roles (e.g., as defensive antibiotics). Hence, this project, while specifically directed at gibberellin metabolism, will offer insights into a much broader group of natural products.Broader ImpactOn-going broader outreach efforts also will be continued and expanded. Beyond the inclusion of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in research, work will be continued with high school students and those from under-represented groups. In addition, the project includes presentations to junior and senior high school science teachers to provide concrete examples of how basic research underlies and informs technological advancements that improve the human condition. An important example is the relationship of gibberellin to the  Green Revolution  as noted above.

199,"Intellectual meritThe long-term goal of this project  is to understand the molecular mechanism, biological function, and evolutionary history of subcellular positioning of signaling molecules in plants and animals.  In particular the project here is to characterize subcellular position and function of RanGAP in plant cells.  Ran is a small GTPase that controls multiple cellular processes and plays a central role in the spatial and temporal organization of vertebrate cells.  Key to this role is a dynamic gradient between the two forms of Ran, RanGTP and RanGDP, acting as a cellular positioning system.  In animal cells RanGAP functions in nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle organization, and post-mitotic nuclear assembly.   In a previous study the PI showed that in plants RanGAP functions in phragmoplast-based cytokinesis which suggests a separate evolutionary history for the spatial organization and function of RanGAP in plants than that in animals.  This project will focus on the specific role of RanGAP in plants using Arabidopsis as the model system.  There are three specific aims.  In vivo methods for intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) adapted from applications in animal systems will be used to test hypothesis one that a gradient of RanGTP::RanGDP is established during mitosis in plant cells.  Bimolecular fluorescence complementation will be use in specific aim two to define the minimal RanGAP anchor at the plant nuclear pore.  For specific aim three mutant RanGAP derivatives will be tested for functional complementation of RanGAP depleted plant lines to dissect the different regions of RanGAP and determine if there are separate protein domains with separate functions.  This work has evolutionary implications in that it suggests that multiple methods have evolved to spatially organize the highly conserved Ran protein, both in interphase cells and during mitosis.  This suggests larger underlying differences between plant and animal nuclear pore architecture, and identifies a previously unrecognized connection in plants between the nuclear pore, Ran and cytokinesis.  Broader impactPostdocs, graduate-students and undergraduate students will be trained on this project. Based on this ongoing research project, the PI has developed a new Plant Cell Biology course for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, currently the only Plant Cell Biology course of this type offered at Ohio State University. Through prior NSF funding, the PI has developed a searchable database for Arabidopsis coiled-coil proteins and has used it for a computational module in a local Functional Genomics Summer Course.  Student-created data will be used as the basis for parallel coiled-coil databases for rice and Chlamydomonas.  These data are currently improved and validated in collaboration with two undergraduate institutions to use them as a teaching resource for computational biology courses.  The research proposed here aids in the functional annotation of the computationally identified coiled-coil proteins and in sharing new data for the activities at the undergraduate institutions. The PI is involved in an outreach activity, offering a 10-module, online course for the general public on Plant Biotechnology. This in turn resulted in the publication of a paper on outreach in science, to communicate  to other researchers the need for and approaches to academic outreach activities.  These and comparable activities are ongoing and expected to continue for the duration of the current award period.

200,"The centromere is the domain of a chromosome that governs the segregation and transmission of the chromosome from generation to generation.  It has been well demonstrated in several model species that the establishment and maintenance of the centromere in its location on a chromosome is determined by epigenetic modifications of centromeric DNA and/or centromeric proteins.  Epigenetic modifications change the behavior of DNA without actually changing the DNA sequence itself.  Although vitally important for centromere function, little is known about which epigenetic modifications are critical and whether any are specific to the complex of DNA, RNA and protein that makes up centromeric chromatin.  Using rice as a model and approaches that include chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing, this project will reveal the location of epigenetic marks, such as cytosine DNA methylation and histone modifications, associated with centromeric chromatin.  The information generated from this project will also provide information about the potential levels of transcription associated with centromeric DNA compared with DNA located outside the centromere region.  Broader Impacts: The personnel of this project will be involved in teaching an annual Plant Cytogenetics Training Workshop for the plant genome research community.  This workshop provides hands-on training in several molecular cytogenetic techniques.  This project will also provide summer research training for minority undergraduate students along with area high school students.  The results of this project will have an impact on future technology development that can be used to improve agricultural practices.

201,"The Xanthomonas Genomics Conference 2009 will provide a venue for researchers from around the globe to share results and ideas.  Xanthomonas constitutes the largest and most important group of plant-associated bacteria. Members of the genus cause diseases on many crop and ornamental species, as well as model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, tomato, and Medicago truncatula. Genomics is at the center of a revolution in Xanthomonas biology. Genome sequence-enabled studies are leading to a better understanding of Xanthomonas signaling and effector molecules. These studies, integrated with host plant genome-enabled research, are elucidating important plant processes. Next generation sequencing technologies are accelerating discovery. A major goal of this conference is to establish consensus objectives, standardized technologies, and common resources that will promote continued rapid progress. The 24 confirmed speakers are leaders and emerging leaders in Xanthomonas research, plant-pathogen interactions, and related fields.  Xanthomonas is rapidly becoming the premier model for understanding functional, regulatory, and evolutionary aspects of plant-bacterial interactions. As Xanthomonas genomics continues to drive advances in fundamental biology, it will similarly drive the development of refined diagnostic, epidemiological, and other tools to prevent and control the many plant diseases members of the genus cause, and potentially other bacterial diseases of plants and even animals. To broaden the impact of the meeting, a white paper stating the conclusions of the roundtable discussions will be disseminated.  Travel grants and fee discounts will be offered to facilitate attendance of young scientists, women and underrepresented minorities.

202,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Researchers at Rice University have been awarded a grant for an interdisciplinary project in software development, evolutionary biology and comparative genomics that will create new computational methods and web-based resources for comparing and interpreting how genes are organized in the chromosomes of humans, other animals, plants and other complex organisms.  Biologists studying the large-scale organization of genomes -- the arrangement of genes on chromosomes -- recently discovered that species that had diverged more than 500 million years ago still have genomes that are organized in similar ways. It is not known whether the conservation is due to a very slow decay of a neutral feature of genome organization, or due to the action of selection through an unknown functional link between genome organization and phenotype. The project will take two new approaches to the problem. The first approach uses a heuristic search procedure to identify the most parsimonious historical scenario explaining the data. The second approach uses Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo to estimate the probabilities of historical scenarios given a model of genome evolution. The tools and databases created by this project will allow scientists to more easily compare and contrast the structure of genomes. In particular, the tools will allow scientists to do side-by-side studies of both modern and reconstructed ancient genomes.  By comparing and contrasting the organizational structure of genomes, scientists hope to better understand evolution, biodiversity and the mechanisms species use to fight stress and disease.  This project will provide interdisciplinary training in software development, evolutionary biology and comparative genomics to the researchers and students who participate. The web-based interface to the results will be used as a source of projects and exercises in an undergraduate course in evolution and bioinformatics taught by the project leader.

203,"Principal investigator:  William Edward FriedmanProposal number:  IOS-0919986Proposal title:   Did the First Angiosperms Lack an Embryo-Nourishing Endosperm? This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).The origin of flowering plants represents one of the most significant evolutionary radiations of plants during the last 475 million years.  With over 250,000 extant species, angiosperms are the largest and most diverse group of plants to have evolved.  It has long been assumed that the first flowering plants formed a nutrient-storing and embryo-nourishing tissue called endosperm that is derived from a second fertilization event during the process of double fertilization.  Indeed, many evolutionary biologists have suggested that endosperm represents a key innovation associated with the ecological and evolutionary ?success? and radiation of flowering plants.  Although poorly studied, there is fragmentary evidence that many of the most ancient lineages of angiosperms do not rely upon an endosperm as the primary embryo-nourishing tissue within the seed. It is the explicit goal of the project to study the embryological processes within seeds of ancient extant lineages of flowering plants in order to reconstruct the pattern of embryo-nourishing behavior of the first angiosperms.  The comparative developmental data to be derived from this project have the potential to lead to the discovery of a  missing link  associated with the transition from the ancestors of flowering plants to the earliest angiosperms.  Among the broader impacts of this project, it should be noted that two out of every three calories consumed by humans worldwide are derived from the endosperm of flowering plants (e.g., rice, maize, barley, wheat, coconut).  Thus, examination of seed development in ancient lineages of angiosperms will provide basic biological information that may ultimately be relevant in an applied and agricultural context.  In addition, the questions to be addressed in this project are sufficiently basic to warrant the expectation that the findings will contribute to undergraduate and graduate curriculum development at the national and international levels, as has been the case in the past.  Discoveries from this project can be expected to be widely disseminated to the general public.  During the last grant cycle, research findings were publicized in a number of media outlets including CBS News, USA Today, Natural History Magazine (invited article), New Scientist, Science News, the Telegraph (U.K.), as well as a variety of websites from around the world.  Finally, this project can be expected to contribute to the development of human resources in the sciences and the advancement of members of underrepresented groups in the sciences.  The Friedman lab has consistently included a high proportion of women and members of underrepresented groups, all of who aspire to careers in the life sciences as educators (two recent members of the lab have gone on to teach secondary science in public schools) and/or practicing scientists (the most recent Ph.D. student to graduate is Hispanic).  In essence, while the vast majority of funds associated with this project will go to support the solution of basic and longstanding scientific questions, these funds will also be central to the development of a few of the next generation of biologists and teachers.

207,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).0853707DenslowGrowing evidence suggests that many nanomaterials are taken up into fish species through the gills or digestive track.  Once internalized, there is a potential for nanomaterials to cross into the blood stream, where they could pose a risk to internal organs including the ovary.  Emerging literature and preliminary evidence in the current application suggest that nanomaterials may be capable of entering oocytes, potentially impacting embryonic development.  There is a need to understand fundamental mechanisms that enable nanomaterial transport to oocytes, and the subsequent alterations of natural biological processes. It is currently understood that the physiological behavior of nanomaterials is largely impacted by adsorbed proteinaceous layers, which form upon seconds of exposure to biological media. Female fish that are actively reproducing have high serum levels (up to 20 mg/ml) of the egg yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin.  This protein is a large phospholipoglycoprotein that has the capacity to bind to nanomaterials through various conduits, including areas of high negative charge and areas of high hydrophobicity.  Vitellogenin is naturally targeted to developing oocytes and is imported into these oocytes via a vitellogenin-specific receptor. The overall hypothesis of this project is that vitellogenin-bound nanomaterials will be imported into yolk granules in developing oocytes and eventually merge with lysosomes.  Furthermore, upon reaching this compartment certain nanomaterials could dissolve and leach into the cell causing toxicity for developing embryos.  To address these hypotheses, the researchers have 3 specific aims: (1) Determine the effect of surface modification on uptake, cellular distribution and retention of nanomaterials in fish ovarian cultures. (2) Characterize the protein surface coating of nanomaterials exposed to male and female fathead minnow plasma. (3) Determine the distribution and reproductive toxicity of nanoparticles in vivo. To achieve these aims they will use model luminescent nanoparticulates, namely dye doped silica and quantum dots of carefully chosen size distributions and surface properties that will enable detailed analysis of the movement of these materials in vitro and in vivo. The proposed research will provide critical insights into the role of nanoparticulate properties on their translocation to oocytes.  This information is anticipated to be highly important in the development of predictive models for nanotoxicity in fish species, and methods to mitigate potentially adverse outcomes of nanomaterial exposure to the environment.  Cross-disciplinary training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students at the interface between particle science and engineering and biology will be an essential part of the research program.  The Southeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (SEAGEP), related Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs, and established minority fellowship programs at the University of Florida will be leveraged to ensure diversity in the research program.  Research results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at national and international meetings.  The investigators also plan to collaborate with national nanotechnology resources such as the Center for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University and ICON at Rice to disseminate research results to the scientific and educational communities, and to society at large.  The students will also participate in public outreach programs (e.g., UF's Engineering Fair)providing a conduit for them to engage the general public about the excitement of nanoscience and the importance of environmental stewardship.  UF's Graham Center for Public Policy will be engaged to ensure that research findings are appropriately communicated to policy makers.  The proposed research will provide fundamental knowledge of factors that mediate nanoparticle transport to oocytes, and offer insights on mechanisms that may lead to alterations in fish embryos.

210,"The 20th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research (ICAR) will take place from June 30th to July 4th 2009 in Scotland at the Edinburgh International Conference Center. The PI requests funds to support attendance of young researchers and participants from minority-serving institutions. The annual ICAR brings together approximately 1,000 participants. Arabidopsis serves an outstanding model system due to the numerous and varied experimental tools in functional genomics that are available. The transfer of knowledge from Arabidopsis to other plant species, and beyond to other organisms including humans, is increasing due to the efforts of the research community and the leveraging of advances and resources. This conference provides an opportunity for the exchange of ideas among the numerous and diverse researchers of the international Arabidopsis community and beyond to the larger plant community. This year's conference will include a number of speakers whose research involves wheat, rice, maize, and barley. The conference will include a broad range of important and current topics: Genome Organization/The RNA World, Development, Cell Biology, Systems Biology, Signaling in Development, Bioenergy, Environmental Responses, Plant Defense, Plant Growth Regulators, Natural Variation, Hot Topics and Novel Tools/Resources. Important components of the conference include the presentation of current research by approximately 90 speakers (both invited and from selected abstracts) and 600 posters as well as several community organized workshops where smaller groups can explore more specific topics in greater detail. Broader Impact A particular strength of the ICAR lies in its ability to enhance the exchange of information at the forefront of Arabidopsis research worldwide, creating new networks and collaborations. The conference program and abstracts will be publicly available on the conference website and permanently archived. The ICAR also has a long and successful history of being inclusive of young scientists as well as women and minorities. Support of this year's proposal will provide full funding for several underrepresented US minorities and/or faculty as well as partial funding of travel expenses for additional young domestic faculty, postdoctoral scholars, or graduate students. A special luncheon to acknowledge recipients of US-sponsored minority funding and to establish an informal networking venue as well as an  Emerging Scientists Luncheon  is planned. Many of the oral presentations at the sessions and workshops will be given by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty. This will promote the training of students and postdocs and provide important opportunities for career development.

211,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)Chemistry of oceanic island basalts (OIBs) reflects the complexity of compositions and processes in the Earth's mantle. Isotope and trace element geochemistry have established that parent lithologies of OIBs in the Earth's mantle are heterogeneous. However, the case of major element heterogeneity in OIBs is not completely understood as the full spectrum of major element compositions of OIBs have so far not been produced by laboratory experiments. Especially, the major element compositions of OIBs that carry isotopic signatures of recycled crust cannot be reconciled with existing melting experiments on subducted oceanic crust. This proposal is to test whether melting of subducted oceanic crust, in the presence of CO2-rich fluids or carbonates, produces magmas (partial melts of the Earth's mantle) with major element compositions similar to alkalic OIBs. The aim is to constrain the major and trace element compositions of silicate partial melts derived from carbonated basaltic eclogite, and the compositional evolution of such melts through reaction with mantle peridotite. The experiments will be performed at a pressure range of 2 to 4 GPa. In particular, the experiments will be performed to address the following fundamental questions: (1) What are the compositions of silicate partial melts of silica-excess eclogite in the presence of CO2 and can carbonated crust act as a root source of alkalic OIBs? (2) How do eclogite+CO2-derived melt compositions change owing to interaction with shallow mantle, depleted harzburgite? (3) What is the contribution of recycled carbonated crust in the origin of intraplate basalts? (4) What are the plausible conditions (depths/temperatures/source compositions) of generation of alkali OIBs? In this work, laboratory experiments will be conducted to simulate high pressure, high temperature conditions relevant for magma generation processes beneath oceanic islands. Analysis of the partially molten quenched rocks will be carried out using well established techniques of optical and electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and mass spectrometry. The obtained results will further the understanding of genesis of basalts (the dominant rock that makes up the ocean floor) and will add to link melting of heterogeneous mantle rocks and deep carbon cycle. The results will be integrated with other sister-disciplines in the broad field of solid Earth science that seek to capture the complex processes in the Earth's mantle in general and in the source regions of basalts in particular. The work will support a newly established experimental petrology laboratory and a starting faculty member at Rice University. The research will also involve education and training of graduate and undergraduate researchers.

214,"AbstractPI: John B. AndersonProposal Number: 0837925Title: History of, and Mechanisms Leading to, Post-LGM Retreat of the West Antarctic Ice SheetThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is believed to be vulnerable to climate change as it is grounded below sea level, is drained by rapidly flowing ice streams and is fringed by floating ice shelves subject to melting by incursions of relatively warm Antarctic circumpolar water.  Currently, the most rapidly thinning glaciers in Antarctica occur in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea sectors.  This study seeks to place the present day observations into a longer-term geological context. Mechanisms that led to the retreat of the ice sheet from the West Antarctic continental shelf since the last glacial maximum will be investigated.  This study will build on a number of previous investigations and fill in key data gaps in the region. Bathymetric mapping and direct sampling of relict glacial features on the continental shelves of the Bellingshausen (Marguerite Bay), Amundsen (Pine Island Bay) and eastern Ross Seas will be conducted via dedicated science time on the Swedish Icebreaker Oden.  Sites for Kasten coring will be selected on the basis of detailed swath mapping.  Radiocarbon dating of glaciomarine deposits in the new and existing cores will refine the timing of retreat events.  Geomorphic features of paleo ice streams such as grounding line wedges and ice scours will be examined to assess whether the retreat occurred continuously and/or episodically.  Sediments will be examined for paleontological evidence of warm ocean water intrusions during retreat as well as for mineral evidence of possible melt water origins.Broader impacts:This project is collaborative with colleagues from the US, Sweden, the UK, France, Japan and Poland.  It will entail the training of three PhD students at Rice University and so afford them international field work experience.  One of these will be transitioning to post-doc status in the course of this project.  An undergraduate student will also be involved in the fieldwork phase of the research.  The PI expects to continue to be active in Rice University's Houston area high school teacher outreach program as well as a separate program to convey science to elderly people confined in assisted living and retirement facilities. abstracting; American; Antarctic; Antarctica; Area; Assisted Living Facilities; Award; base; climate change; Data; Deposition; Doctor of Philosophy; Elderly; Event; experience; France; Funding; Glacier; high school; Ice; Ice Cover; International; Investigation; Island; Japan; Laws; Maps; melting; Minerals; Oceans; outreach program; Phase; Poland; Postdoctoral Fellow; programs; Recording of previous events; Recovery; Research; Retirement; Rice; Sampling; School Teachers; Science; Sea; Site; Stream; Students; Sweden; Time; Training; Universities; Water; WorkHISTORY OF, AND MECHANISMS LEADING TO, POST-LGM RETREAT OF THE WEST ANTARCTIC",0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
215,"The Bari workshop on the deformation and failure of geomaterials will expose young researchers to recent developments in the mechanics of granular materials that are relevant to the behavior of geomaterials. Daily classes on modeling, simulation, and experiment will be complimented by invited lectures given by distinguished researchers. The practical problem of interest is the stability of rocky slopes and the possible prediction of landslide initiation. Consequently, the focus of the workshop will be on the deformation and failure of geological materials. Topics to be addressed include the derivation of continuum theories based on particle interactions, the use discrete element simulations of particles in developing continuum theory, the implementation of continuum theories in finite element simulations, and the interpretation of experimental results.   The workshop will be held between Sunday, June 14 and June 19, 2009 in a country hotel located in Puglia, Italy.  Researchers with backgrounds in engineering, mathematics, physics, and geology are being encouraged to apply. The daily courses, each lasting a total of six hours during the week, will be led by Boris Jeremic (University of California, Davis), Cino Viggiani (Universite Joseph Fourier, France), Julia Morgan (Rice University), and Jean-Noël Roux (Institut Navier, France).  The invited lectures will be given by Antonio Gens (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Spain), James Jenkins (Cornell University), David Muir-Wood (Bristol University, UK), and James Rice (Harvard University).   This award will support the participation in the workshop of up to eight young U.S. researchers. The support will include both travel and local expenses. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity to the researchers who are supported is the direct benefit derived from the course material and the distinguished lectures.

216,"0852008John S. HutchinsonThis ten week REU site program at Rice University will provide community college students with a hands-on research experience in the field of nanotechnology. Specific research areas span the whole range of nanotechnology, including the synthesis and characterization of new nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and quantum dots (QDs); application of nanomaterials to air and water purification; nanoparticle (NP) photonics and plasmonics; application of nanomaterials in medical imaging, diagnosis, and treatment; and engineering the energetics of nanomaterials. The ethics component of this program will provide a framework for the research experience and will allow students to explore the ethical implications of anthropological and historical studies.  To enhance the hands-on research experience, a variety of activities have been incorporated.  These include: tours of local research labs such as the Johnson Space Center and ExxonMobile; instruction in public presentation; a poster session workshop; and social activities. At the conclusion of the research experience, the students will present their research findings in a competitive formal poster session to research faculty, staff and students. This program will specifically focus recruitment efforts on community college students in the Texas Gulf Coast area.  These schools (San Jacinto Community College, Lonestar College, Galveston Community College, College of the Mainland, Wharton, and Houston Community College) will provide a diverse pool of talented future researchers who might not otherwise have the resources or opportunities to pursue careers in research. This REU program will serve as a bridge between two-year and four-year colleges and will be a pipeline for these students to graduate school.  Participants in this program will have the unique opportunity to work with at-risk inner-city high school students in the Rice University JP Morgan Chase Science and Engineering Career Academy, serve as mentors for these students and interact with high school teacher interns.  Results from the research will be disseminated via student publications in The Journal of Young Investigators, faculty publications in peer-reviewed engineering education journals, on the Rice NanoREU Website, on the National Center for Learning and Teaching in Nanoscale Science and Engineering Resource Portal and via YouTube videos.

217,"Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation-Senior AllianceProject SummaryThe Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (H-LSAMP) is comprised of the University of Houston, University of Houston-Downtown, Texas Southern University,Texas State University, Houston Community College, San Jacinto College, Rice University, and the Houston Independent School District. During this proposal, the senior alliance will work to institutionalize the Collaborative Learning Community system while enhancing the alliance through 1) recruiting and retaining well-qualified minority Science, Engineering, Technology, and Mathematics majors in an effort to graduate nearly 1,300underrepresented minority STEM majors annually, 2) developing a mechanism toincrease community college transfer to 75% of level one students, 3) increasing student research and internship participation to over 90% of level one students, 4) sending 10 or more students overseas on meaningful international experiences.Student Scholars will receive stipends to support their efforts in the collaborative learning community including facilitating workshops, conducting research, providing tutor support, and assisting in enrichment workshops. Scholars will be mentored by a combination of faculty, staff, and peers; have access to student support services such as career centers, writing centers, tutor labs, and academic excellence workshops.Intellectual Merit: The H-LSAMP proposal is based on strong student supportsystems developed from current research and best practices, a proven record ofsuccess, and a demonstrated record of institutionalization. The H-LSAMP programrecruits and supports a large at-risk and financially disadvantaged minority student population in the Southeast Texas region. This alliance works because of a balanced and thorough management plan, with input from all levels of the universities and school systems it serves. A comprehensive collaborative learning community is being institutionalized on all campuses. The alliance expects to contribute to the broader knowledge base by disseminating important new knowledge about the factors that contribute to retention and recruitment of underrepresented minorities, primarily Hispanic and African-Americans pursuing STEM degrees.Broader Impacts: Texas has a growing economy; while the US lost over 279,000 jobs from August 2007-August 2008, Texas gained 252,000. This growth further outlines the need for a diversified STEM workforce, making programs such as LSAMP even more important, as economically disadvantaged students have a harder time making inroads into technology driven economies. The H-LSAMP affects over 550 level one students and an estimated 5,500-6,000 level two students annually in a comprehensive STEM program. Along with career guidance, and effective career path counseling programs, the alliance sends nearly 40% of its graduates into graduate or professional education post graduation, while placing students in the workforce nationally. With the increasing trend toward globalization in the STEM fields, the alliance is seeking to significantly increase the international exposure and cultural literacy of itsscholars in order to better position them to take up leadership roles in a globalized workforce. Each round of funding has provided the resources required to institutionalize parts of the program, now averaging around $1 million annually.

220,"Abstract The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 41 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have six primary sponsoringuniversities: The University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Rice University, the University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and Texas Christian University. The conference is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the active community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states. The conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states. Summaries of talks with notation of important results have been publicly reported for some time and will continue similarly in the future. By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a pilot project to foster research opportunities for junior faculty. abstracting; Advertising; austin; base; Commit; Communities; design; Disabled Persons; Event; Faculty; falls; Fees; Fostering; Future; Geographic Locations; graduate student; Historically Black Colleges and Universities; Human Resources; Individual; International; Mathematics; meetings; Minority; Pilot Projects; planetary Atmosphere; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Rice; Schools; Series; symposium; Texas; Time; Universities; WomanTEXAS GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY CONFERENCE",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
221,"ABSTRACT Principal Investigator: Rojas, J. Maurice    Proposal Number: DMS - 0915235  Institution: Texas A&M Research Foundation Title: Texas Algebraic Geometry Seminar (TAGS) 2009The Texas Algebraic Geometry Seminar (TAGS), sponsored by Texas A&M University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Rice University, is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the growing community of Texas algebraic geometers and researchers in related areas. This proposal is for partial funding of this important conference. The conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to Texas to discuss research in algebraic geometry and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states. A principal area of mathematics, algebraic geometry is also the source of algorithms behind much of modern technology. For example, a thorough technical understanding of cryptography, coding theory, or quantum computing is impossible without the language of algebraic geometry.  The conference makes it possible for the community of algebraic geometers from Texas and surrounding states (a large geographic region) to meet and share new results on a regular basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Also, the conference is dedicated to the development of graduate students and young faculty in algebraic geometry. Finally, the unique environment at Texas A&M, where classically trained algebraic geometers work on applied problems with impact in areas such as signal processing and computer science, insures that the conference will have an impact that goes well beyond mathematics.

222,"This award provides continued support for a successful 10-week summer REU site within the Statistics Department at Rice University for the study of Statistics and its applications. As the number of domestic graduate students in the Mathematical Sciences continues to decline, there is a critical need to develop human resources to continue supporting the United States' advantage in the world of science and technology. The Rice University Summer Institute of Statistics (RUSIS) has been successful in encouraging students to pursue graduate degrees in Mathematics and Statistics. Roughly 85% of the students who have attended RUSIS and have graduated, are now doctoral students in Ph.D. programs around the country, and roughly 61% of them are members of underrepresented populations in Mathematics. RUSIS has accomplished this through intensive courses, close supervision of research projects, and visits to various research institutes and agencies in Houston. Specifically, the program  Trains and mentors 17 (12 NSF- and 5 NSA-supported) selected underrepresented minority students and students with no easy access to a career experience at their institution, including community college students, through intensive core courses in probability, stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest. (e.g.  multiple comparisons, extreme value theory, multivariate survival analysis, risk-reliability-sustainability of complex infrastructure systems, artificial intelligence, statistical learning, statistical genetics, and general biostatistics).  Engages the students in research projects under close collaboration with faculty mentors, and with the objective of producing joint publications. Students present their results at national meetings and they are mentored in the preparation and presentation of their talks. In addition, students meet with an advisory committee composed of top scientists and present their work to them.  Teaches short courses on the use of Unix platforms, LaTeX, and software to be utilized for research purposes such as Mathematica, Splus and/or R, and Matlab; Organizes student and faculty visits to scientific facilities (e.g., Biomathematics and Biostatistics at MD Anderson Cancer Center, NASA) and a series of lectures, by distinguished scientists, is scheduled. These lectures cover a variety of topics ranging from applying to Graduate School to career experiences by outstanding scientists, and discussion of cutting-edge topics in Statistics. Evaluates and monitors the progress of students for seven years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their participation; annual evaluation of the program by the participating students and an external advisory committee is an integral and valuable part of the program.

223,"The goals of this project are to understand how certain types of bacteria are capable of supplying themselves with nitrogen fertilizer, which is required for the growth of all organisms. The project will determine at the cellular and molecular level, how these bacteria, called cyanobacteria, produce the cells and enzymes that  fix  nitrogen from the air to produce compounds that can enter cell metabolism. Cyanobacteria are green in color and obtain energy from sunlight with photosynthesis similarly to plants. Like algae, cyanobacteria are important primary producers, which are food for other organisms, in many environments, especially the oceans, and they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which reduces effects of global warming. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria provide biologically available nitrogen in natural environments and are used as nitrogen fertilizer for rice cultivation in some parts of the world. Recently, there has been enormous interest in using cyanobacteria and algae to capture energy from sunlight to produce biomass, biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol, and hydrogen gas. This project will use the well-established model organism Anabaena to determine how specialized cells called heterocysts produce the enzymes required for nitrogen fixation. The project will use methods of genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry to study these processes. This project is expected to reveal new mechanisms of genetic regulation and gene expression in this large and important group of microorganisms. Understanding the mechanisms that control nitrogen-fixation genes will enhance our knowledge of basic microbial biology, genetics, and metabolism, and will provide knowledge that can be applied to industrial carbon capture and biofuel production. During the course of this project, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students will receive training in state-of-the-art research methods. The research will also produce materials and methods that will be useful to other researchers in both academia and industry, and the long-term goals of this project will benefit society by providing basic knowledge related to natural ecosystems, agriculture, global warming, and biofuels.

224,"This research project has two main objectives. First, it offers an economic foundation of some classical solutions in the theories of social choice and bargaining by dropping the welfarist assumption.  Second, it suggests possible ways of extending these two theories to problems with incomplete information.Most contributions in axiomatic bargaining and social choice are phrased in utilities. It is thus assumed, often implicitly, that two problems must have the same solution if they coincide in the utility space. Unfortunately, this welfarist assumption lacks both a clear normative and positive content, and is thus hard to accept as an axiom. This research project offers a better foundation of social choice and axiomatic bargaining by characterizing some of its main solutions in non-welfarist environments.Informational issues have long been recognized as central in economic theory. However, their implications on cooperation are still not yet well understood. Accordingly, Professor Aumann listed this topic as an important direction for future research in his 2000 presidential address to the Game Theory Society. To be more precise, an impressive amount of work has already been devoted to understand which contracts are feasible under asymmetric information, cf. the theory of mechanism design. Professors Hurwicz, Maskin, and Myerson were awarded the 2007 Sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel for their path-breaking contributions on the topic. Yet very little is known about what specific contract, among those that are feasible, should or will be chosen. This project investigates many different avenues to extend the theories of bargaining and social choice to incomplete information.The theories of social choice and axiomatic bargaining are widely applied, yet the welfarist assumption on which it is founded is not compelling without justification. The present research project will show how some classical axiomatic systems can be completed to derive welfarist solutions in non-welfarist frameworks. Very little work has been done so far on social choice and bargaining under incomplete information, yet there is a clear need of going beyond the mere description of what is feasible.Broader Impact: This research proposal is foundational in its focus. The importance of the questions considered implies that it could have a significant impact on many different practical economic problems. The normative analysis under incomplete information should guide the economic and social debates, concerning, for instance, public health insurance, taxes, or cost sharing. Part of this research will be developed in collaboration with researchers from three other universities: Camelia Bejan (Rice U), David Perez-Castrillo (Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain), and David Wettstein (Ben Gurion University, Israel). The results of this research project will be integrated into a graduate-level course on information, risk and uncertainty that the investigator teaches at Brown University.

225,"PI: Rod A. Wing (University of Arizona)CoPIs: Steven D. Rounsley and Yeisoo Yu (University of Arizona)The objective of this project is to generate and analyze a reference genome sequence of the West African cultivated rice Oryza glaberrima (CG14). The reference sequence will be generated using a minimum tiling path of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones selected from an existing NSF-funded O. glaberrima physical map, which encompasses the entire genome. DNA from these clones will be purified, pooled and sequenced using 454/Roche GSFLX Titanium and paired-end pyrosequencing technologies. A standardized annotation process will be applied across the whole genome taking advantage of the well-curated annotation for the Asian cultivated rice species - Oryza sativa.  In addition, customized analyses targeted at specific biological questions will be performed.  The genome sequence and its annotation will be accessible via public databases, such as GenBank and Gramene (www.gramene.org).  The broader impacts of this project are two-fold. First, since the world's rice-dependent population is expected to double in the next 25 years, rice breeders are faced with the challenge of doubling rice yields with less land and water, and with poorer soils.  Obtaining the genome of the African cultivated rice, O. glaberrima, is the first step towards understanding the differences between the two cultivated species, how each has adapted to their particular environments, and how each may benefit the other to be grown in more diverse and often harsh environments.  The genome sequence produced by this research project will be a resource utilized by biologists and rice breeders as a component in efforts towards improving worldwide rice production. This project also offers several research training opportunities for postdoctoral scientists and students at all levels.  First, students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained to perform research using cutting edge genomics research technologies such as next generation sequencing, physical mapping, de novo assembly of large plant genomes, genome annotation and comparative evolutionary genomics. Their research results will be disseminated through peer review publications and at local and international meetings. Project personnel will serve as mentors for all training activities and will meet regularly with each student and postdoc to ensure they are on track and getting the most out of their research experience.  In addition, the project has partnered with Biotechnology, Agronomy and Plant Science programs at Pima Community College (Tucson AZ), and the Life Science Undergraduate Biology Research Program at University of Arizona to provide undergraduate students with summer research internships.  These students will also have an opportunity to apply for the BRAVO program (http://www.ubrp.arizona.edu/) which allows them to perform research abroad for a minimum of 10 weeks. The project has research partnerships in Benin (West Africa), China, Colombia, France, Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan, all suitable locations for a 10 week international research experience.Finally, the project will participate in the University of Arizona's KEYS program (K-12 Engaging Youth in Science; http://www.bio5.org/training/trainingHigh.php) which provides six week summer research internships for advanced high school students.

Denton (North Dakota State University - Fargo), Oscar Riera-Lizarazu (Oregon State University), Ming-Cheng Luo (University of California - Davis), and Yong Qiang Gu and Gerry Lazo (University of California - Davis/USDA-ARS)Complete sequencing of large and complex genomes of many crop plants such as wheat and other cereals provide a daunting challenge to the genomics community. In order to develop a complete map and finished sequence of the 3.2 Gb human genome, an independent high-resolution marker scaffold composed of 40,322 unique sequence tagged sites was constructed using ninety whole-genome radiation hybrids (RHs). This RH-based physical map was then used to order sequence information for more than 15,000 contigs to create the complete human genome map. The success of RH mapping in humans has inspired its use in the construction of complete physical maps for the majority of animal genomes prior to complete sequencing. This project will use a simple yet elegant method of developing high-resolution RH physical maps that will be used to anchor existing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs and clones for the 4.2 Gb D-genome of hexaploid wheat. This anchoring and alignment will complement a larger effort by the international wheat genomics community to develop a global physical map and whole-genome sequence of this genome. The tools, methods, and knowledge developed in this project can be applied to other crop species and will facilitate the construction of physical maps at a fraction of the cost of current methods. The maps generated will provide easy access to genes of biological and agricultural importance and will enable the development of new strategies to manipulate wheat to better serve the needs of a growing world population. In addition, the information developed in this project will allow for comparative analysis of wheat with rice, maize and other grass genomes to address important biological questions regarding gene organization and chromosome evolution.  Access to the tools, methods, and knowledge developed in this project will be available through the project website (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/RHmapping).  Seed for all lines will be available by contacting project personnel or through the USDA National Small Grains Collection (Aberdeen, ID).  In addition to the training of project students and postdoctoral associates, the project will partner with minority serving institutions including Mississippi Valley State University and the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez to engage minority undergraduate students with an eight-week summer research training program in molecular genetics and bioinformatics.

227,"0903936KulinowskiRice University will host an international workshop on environmental nanotechnology, to contribute towards a sound, science-based document that identifies the tools and practices needed to assess and mitigate the potential impacts of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in the environment and inform eco-responsible design and disposal.  This workshop, tentatively scheduled for March 9-10, 2009, will be partially sponsored by the British Consulate General-Houston, the TX-UK Collaborative, and the International Council on Nanotechnology.  The workshop will address issues of research & education in a meaningful and focused dialogue through an integrated experience that will provide valuable mentorship and international networking opportunities to emerging leaders in this rapidly growing field.  The goal of this workshop is to distill information on environmental impacts of NPs into a format that candirect research efforts toward the most critical issues in the next five to ten years and lead to methodologies to predict their environmental impacts.As governments overcome barriers to international collaboration, new funding streams are becoming available to researchers interested in engaging with their counterparts abroad.  Therefore the workshop will have an explicit emphasis on stimulating trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific research collaboration and will recruit talented junior faculty to the workshop, both to benefit from their fresh perspectives and to connect them with potential collaborators here in the US and abroad.The extrinsic merit of this workshop emanates from its design and participation. This workshop will engage members of the environmental, toxicological, nanotechnology and legal communities in a meaningful and focused dialogue through a unique, integrated, and holistic experience.  This experience will foster dialogue among diverse participants around the most pressing questions related to understanding the impacts of engineered NPs.  The broader impacts will result from the active engagement of the workshop's participants.  This engagement will enhance and strengthen the opportunities for and interest in international, interdisciplinary collaboration on NPs and the environment.  In addition, the workshop will provide a solid foundation for the academic communitys future collaboration in research and education programs, projects, and activities at greater and closer levels than was previously possible.  The proposed work will have substantial benefit to society by providing current, high quality information on environmental health and safety of nanomaterials which will enable the development and implementation of sound risk management practices.

228,"The reversal in the direction of the ionospheric electric field in the region known as the Harang discontinuity is known to play an important role in the large-scale dynamics of the ionosphere and magnetosphere.  This project uses the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the Harang reversal in order to evaluate the physical processes responsible for its formation and characteristics, as well as its evolution during substorms.  The RCM can appropriately take into account the physics of the plasma drift transport within the plasma sheet, and it solves for the ionospheric electric potential self-consistently with the plasma sheet dynamics through their coupling by field-aligned currents. This project will further  develop simulations to be more realistic. A magnetic field solver will provide magnetic fields that are in force balance with the RCM plasma pressures. Particle boundary conditions will be established using observations from the Geotail satellite. This combined model will be used to provide quantitative evaluation of the physical processes believed to govern the Harang reversal. The quantitative results from the simulations will be compared with ground-based radar observations. To evaluate the underlying physical processes, individual physical parameters in the model will be varied to see how the variations effect the Harang reversal. By varying a single paramter while keeping others fixed it will be possible to determine the effect of each parameter on the formation and characteristics of the Harang reversal. To understand the relationship between the Harang reversal and magnetic substorms and to test a substorm theory, this project will evaluate the evolution of the Harang reversal and its correlations to the plasma sheet during the substorm growth phase and during the initial stage after a strong decrease in plasma sheet convection. The project will examine whether or not a decrease in the convective electric field leads towards increasingly rapid changes and instability as predicted by the theory. The simulations will be the first to provide quantitative assessment of the Harang reversal, its correlations with the plasma sheet, its evolution and response to variations of interplanetary conditions during substorms, and its potential use to predict substorms, which will be crucial to understanding magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling within the plasma sheet and substorm triggering.

229,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are fascinating and enigmatic objects in theUniverse. Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) have similarly caught the attention of physicists and astrophysicists, leading to, among other ideas, postulates of exotic origin based on predictions from particle physics. To make clearer a possible connection between UHECRs and GRBs, one needs to  refine  our understanding of how the cosmic ray spectrum couples to burst gamma-ray emission. Forging a more robust model of this connection is a principal goal of this proposal. The mandate to do so has been enhanced by the recent confirmation of the existence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff in the UHECR spectrum at around 6 °? 1019 eV by the Pierre Auger experiment. This project will address how does the relativistic nature of the shocked outflow in bursts influence the prompt emission spectra that was detected in the gamma-ray band. A second question that will be addressed is what is the relative efficiency of accelerating electrons and ions in relativistic shocks thought to be present in GRBs, and how can photon data from these sources be used to probe this efficiency ratio,. Two other questions that will be investigated are whether GRB shocks efficiently generate ion populations up to the extremely high UHECR energies, and what are the anticipated neutrino fluxes from GRBs as potential signals for the IceCube experiment?  The broader impacts are that  the results will be adapted for display on publicly maintained Web sites. A graduate student will be engaged as an integral part of the work and this student will be involved in teaching at least two lectures per year on gamma-ray bursts in appropriate ndergraduate Rice courses. A long term goal of the PI is to develop a summer course at Rice offered to senior undergraduates including the topic of gamma-ray bursts.

230,"In our everyday lives, we are frequently confronted with information from multiple sensory modalities.  Recently, there has been increasing interest in the circumstances under which stimuli presented in one sensory modality influence sensations in a different modality. For instance, the sound of a mosquito buzzing seemingly enhances sensitivity to touch (tactile stimulation) on our skin; seeing an insect crawling on someone else's arm seems to affect our own tactile perception. Despite several recent studies examining the influence of audition and vision on touch, the brain mechanisms responsible for these interactions are poorly understood.  An NSF-funded collaborative effort of Tony Ro (Rice University) and Michael Beauchamp (University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston) will use a combination of converging methods to examine tactile processing in isolation and the influence of vision and audition on touch in the human brain. Psychophysical studies will be conducted to determine the optimal stimulus parameters that demonstrate an influence of vision and audition on tactile perception. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be used to localize the brain regions involved with integrating multisensory information.  While most of these experiments will be conducted using normal controls, an additional series of experiments will be conducted in a unique patient who acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia following a stroke.  Tactile sensitivity on the patient's left hand and arm was impaired, but he now feels tactile sensations in that area in response to sounds. Psychophysical and imaging experiment will be completed on this patient to determine the neural mechanisms responsible for the synesthesia, especially whether plastic neural changes have reconstituted the patient's somatosensory cortex so that it is now responds to sounds.These studies will not only better our understanding of multisensory integration, but will provide a deeper appreciation of general information processing mechanisms of the human brain.  Such knowledge will contribute towards the development of better rehabilitative tools for patients with congenital or acquired sensory deficits to one or more of the sensory systems.  Additionally, this research will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of natural and brain-damaged induced changes that take place in the adult human brain.  The funding will be used to support research training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging in the Houston area.  In addition to training the next generation of brain scientists, the findings of this research will be disseminated through scientific and lay publications, as well as other media outlets, allowing for a deeper understanding and appreciation of the human brain in society.

231,"Rice is one of the world's most important food crops and a major crop in some U.S. states. Rice is also used as a model system for the cereals because of its small genome that has been completely sequenced and because of other features that facilitate experimental biology such as ease of transformation. Unraveling the functions of the estimated 40,000+ genes in rice will have a significant impact on the biology, as well as breeding, of rice and other cereals. The International Rice Functional Genomics Consortium (http://irfgc.irri.org/) of rice researchers from 10 leading countries including the USA is responsible for the coordination of all international efforts towards this end. A major activity of the Consortium is the International Symposium of Rice Functional Genomics (ISRFG), which is held in a different country each year. The ISRFG is the most important conference in rice genomics and attracts wide international participation. The 6th ISRFG will be held in Korea in November 10 - 12, 2008, and is expected to attract 400 participants from 30 countries. This conference will provide information about the current status of rice functional genomics research, stimulate exchanges of ideas, collaborations, and efficient strategies for achieving the goal of understanding the functions of all rice genes. The funding provided by NSF will be used to broaden participation of young scientists from the US community.  Their participation in this conference will benefit and enhance research in the US using rice as an experimental system, as well as research into other cereal crops.

232,"DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The purpose of this training program is to train future scientists to design, implement, select, and evaluate health information technology (HIT) that increases the quality and safety of healthcare. We will achieve this goal by training scientists who can develop and apply human-centered methods and techniques to HIT, drawing from research and methods in human factors engineering, quality improvement, information sciences, and related areas. To prepare scientists to meet this challenge, trainees must intermingle two training experiences. The first gives a solid foundation in informatics, research design and evaluation, human-centered design, and quality improvement. The second offers trainees first-hand experience through research programs that give them the opportunity to put their didactic training to practice by working on HIT that increases safety and quality of care. The program will be managed through the W.M. Keck Center. Trainees may be enrolled at any of the following five Keck Center member universities participating in the proposal: The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, and The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Research opportunities are available at these universities and at several other Texas Medical Center institutions and Centers that have agreed to participate as research sites in the program. These include Memorial Hermann Health Care System, Memorial Hermann TIRR, and the VA Medical Center, among others.

233,"Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, has been well documented for over 200 years as a significant pest in the USA and other regions of the western hemisphere. Due in part to occurrence of plant host strains, it can feed on over 60 species of plants including a wide variety of crops used for food, fiber and biofuels. Pest management depends on insecticides and an increasing reliance on transgenic crops. Yet resistance to both controls occurs in the field. Thus, efforts to discover and develop inborn plant resistant varieties are crucial to improvement and sustainability of integrated pest management of fall armyworm and other caterpillar pests. Proficient discovery and development of in born plant resistance requires understanding the functional genomics (gene sequences, functions and effects) underlying the nutritional ecology of insect crop pests. Fall armyworm is an excellent model system for investigating these genomic mechanisms. This project's scientists have found a link between larval nutritional ecology, development of resistant corn lines, dispersal and other life-history characteristics of fall armyworm. Existence of two genetically different plant host strains defined by their nutritional ecology as corn and rice strains could lead to deciphering genes determining how variation in nutritional adaptation leads to host plant preference. Such research cannot proceed because the necessary functional genomic knowledge is lacking for fall armyworm and other crop pests. Therefore, a primary benefit of this project will be a public, WEB-accessible transcriptome with sequences of expressed genes whose function is defined according to tissue, life stage, host strain and putative biochemical function. Another benefit will be a public catalogue of variation in sequence coding for use as genetic markers that will be highly valuable in deducing implications of population dynamics, gene flow, resistance and dispersal on pest management. Functionally important variation underlying the nutritional ecology of organisms' is governed by regulation of gene expression. Thus, this project will use the transcriptome to analyze changes in gene expression level as fall armyworm feed on the caterpillar resistant MP708 corn line. MP708 producing Mir-CP plant protease is one of the most promising in born (not genetically engineered) lines of corn resistant to moth caterpillar pests. Degradative action of Mir-CP on protein comprising the peritrophic membrane of caterpillar guts is unique and disrupts nutrient utilization. A third benefit from this project will be advancing development of MP708 corn by discovering gene expression profiles in specific caterpillar tissues and host strains that respond to the effects of eating resistant MP708 corn. Overall, this project will create public genomic toolsets available for enhanced understanding of prominent moth pest biology and discover host plant-dependent effects on the nutritional ecology of these pests leading to improved pest management through the use of inborn plant resistance.

234,"Due to a steady decline in investment and shift of plant breeding activities to the private sector, empirical plant breeding research and education in most US universities have been drastically curtailed resulting in reduced output of qualified plant breeders. Plant breeding is evolving at a rapid pace with assimilation of knowledge and technological advances in multiple disciplines. Specifically, the genomics tools and resources are contributing in a significant way to make plant breeding more vibrant and more efficient. The overall goal of this integrated project is to accelerate research, instruction, and outreach activities at the Louisiana State University AgCenter with the emphasis on marker-assisted breeding to improve disease resistance in rice, corn, and sugarcane. The project will provide an excellent opportunity to graduate students to acquire knowledge, expertise, and experience required to lead successful plant breeding programs in future.

235,"Heterotrimeric G-proteins consisting of alpha, beta and gamma &#61472;subunits are signal transducers in all eukaryotes. The repertoire of G-protein components in plants is relatively simple, with the presence of only two possible heterotrimers in Arabidopsis and rice, versus hundreds of possible trimeric combinations in animal systems. However the plant G-protein components are involved in diverse pathways including phytohormone signaling, cell division, ion channel regulation, environment sensing and biotic and abiotic stress responses of plants. These data have led to the hypothesis that the plant G-proteins integrate multiple signals to optimize overall growth and development under any given condition. Most of our knowledge of plant G-proteins comes from studies of gene knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis and a mutation in rice G alpha gene. Pharmacological evidence support the roles of G-proteins in soybean growth and development, defense response, nodulation and nitrogen fixation, however no biochemical or molecular-genetic data exist to date to validate these observations. Our analysis of soybean sequences has identified four G alpha, four G beta&#61472; and six putative G gamma subunits in its genome, predicting ninety-six possible heterotrimeric combinations and making it the most diverse G-protein network known to date in plants. We propose to characterize the soybean G-proteins and evaluate their specific roles during growth and development with respect to the plant hormones GA and ABA in the context of a hitherto unexplored plant group, legumes.

236,"The cells of the female gametophyte of flowering plants, called the embryo sac, play critical roles in fertilization and seed formation. These include the egg cell which forms the embryo after fertilization, and the central cell forms the endosperm; together, the embryo and endosperm constitute the seed. Despite the simplicity of the embryo sac and its importance to seed formation, virtually nothing is known about the genes that specify these cells. This project will provide an understanding of the basis of cell-specification and function in the rice embryo sac, using as a foundation recent results that show an important role for the phytohormone auxin. We will use isolated single cells from rice embryo sacs to study their response to auxin at the single cell level. We will also manipulate auxin signaling in the rice embryo sac using transgenic rice plants, to test specific hypothesis concerning the control of cell identities such as egg cells by auxin. This research has future applicability to enhancing seed production, an agriculturally important trait. Seed grains constitute major staples in the human diet, as well as feed for animals raised for meat, and more recently are being viewed as sources of oils for biofuels. The female gametophyte is also an important model for the engineering of apomixis in crop plants, by which seed production could be accomplished without meiosis, allowing for fixation of heterozygosity and hybrid vigor. For the above reasons, the proposed research is of importance for the development of novel technologies and approaches that will benefit agriculture.

237,"The genetic material DNA in the nucleus is tightly packed with proteins called histones. Histones can undergo chemical modifications which alter their interaction with DNA and other nuclear proteins. Histone methylation has emerged as an important modification involved in regulating gene expression and genome integrity. In this project, we aim to identify the target genes of a rice enzyme involved in histone methylation using a combination of biochemical, genetic and genomic approaches. Because the enzyme we proposed to study appears to control genetic characteristics such as stature and grain-filling, a better understanding of the mechanism of its action may facilitate future increases in rice productivity (biomass).

238,"SITUATION: The viruses included in this project, maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV), maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and maize necrotic streak virus (MNeSV), are common pathogens of maize, an important crop in the US. In particular, the potyvirus MDMV, is not only an economically important pathogen in its own right, but in combination with MCMV, it also causes the devastating synergistic disease, corn lethal necrosis (CLN). Indeed, synergistic infections with potyviruses cause damaging viral diseases in a variety of crop plants. RATIONALE & PURPOSE: RNA silencing plays an important role in the control of viruses in plants; however, the mechanisms are not completely understood. Here we address the hypothesis that RNA silencing is important not only in host defense (plant against virus) but also in viral counter-defense (virus against plant) during virus infections in maize. A more complete understanding of the role of RNA silencing in viral pathogenesis has real potential to lead to strategies to protect maize and other important crop plants from viral disease. METHODS (APPROACH): Anti-viral silencing is triggered by double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that arises during virus infection. The plant cell cleaves this dsRNA into small fragments called short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which associate with an argonaute (AGO) protein and direct destruction of complementary RNA molecules. Plant AGO gene families are large (10 members in Arabidopsis and 19 in rice), and the particular AGO protein that an siRNA associates with likely determines the function of the siRNA. Our preliminary results using maize seedlings infected with three different viruses show that certain viral siRNAs accumulate to much higher levels than others, and we have identified a number of maize messenger RNAs that are potential targets of some of these highly abundant viral siRNAs. This project will use molecular techniques to address the hypothesis that abundant viral siRNAs are stabilized by association with a particular AGO family member and act to target host messenger RNAs that play a role in antiviral defense. OUTCOMES/IMPACTS: New fundamental knowledge concerning the roles and mechanisms of RNA silencing in controlling virus infection in maize is the expected outcome of this research.

239,"Situation or Problem: The apical meristem of plants is a population of stem cells that generate all of the adult organs of the plant through regulated cell division and differentiation (e.g. from undifferentiated stem cell to leaves or flowers). Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate growth and development and are known to regulate cell division. Several lines of evidence support a role for cytokinins in meristem function, and they likely regulate cell division within the meristem. Cytokinins act by causing changes in gene regulation via activation of transcription factors known as the type-B Response Regulators (RRs). Little is known about how cytokinin and type-B RRs function within the meristem. I will analyze the role that type-B RRs play in meristems in Arabidopsis and rice through the use of reporter genes, loss-of-function type-B RR lines and meristem identity gene promoter regions. These experiments will determine the localization of type-B RRs within the apical meristem (Objective I), how type-B RRs regulate meristem activity (Objective II) and how a meristem maintenance gene and the type-B RRs regulate a shared target gene (Objective III). Purpose and outputs/impacts: These studies will answer fundamental questions on (1) the hormonal regulation of meristem maintenance/function and (2) elucidate the locations and mechanisms of action by type-B RRs in the apical meristems of Arabidopsis and rice. These studies will provide a framework for engineering modifications into cytokinin signal transduction and meristems in crops of agronomic importance.

240,"Many fungi that threaten agriculture invade and reprogram living plant cells to cooperate in their own destruction. It has long been assumed that these fungi deliver proteins, called effectors, across plant cell membranes to block defenses and assume control. However, few such proteins have been identified from fungal pathogens and nothing is known about how effector proteins enter plant cells. The hemibiotrophic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, causes the globally devastating rice blast disease, as well as increasingly-serious emerging diseases such as wheat blast in South American and gray leaf spot on turfgrasses in the US and Japan. We have previously shown that M. oryzae induces formation of a novel structure, the Biotrophic Interfacial Complex (BIC), when it first enters living rice cells, and that effectors secreted by the fungus accumulate in this structure as the fungus continues to grow in the host cell. We also demonstrated that effectors that accumulate in BICs are translocated into the invaded rice cytoplasm, and subsequently move ahead into adjoining rice cells, presumably to prepare them before fungal invasion. PURPOSE: The goal of this project is to identify the structural features of the pathogen?s effectors and mechanisms that mediate their delivery into living host cells. Effector delivery in the rice blast system first involves secretion from the fungus into BICs and then translocation into host cells across the plant membrane. Our first objective will be to identify the structural features of effector proteins that allow them to specifically accumulate in BICs. Our second objective will be to identify the structural motifs that allow the secreted effectors to cross host membrane and enter the host cytoplasm. To understand the targeting signals and translocation mechanism, we will use confocal fluorescence and electron microscopy of fungal strains and rice lines expressing fluorescent reporter proteins, and we will purify effector protein and interacting proteins from infected rice tissue. We will also investigate the role for previously defined secretion components in the BIC accumulation pattern. We will determine the structure of the BIC and investigate the role BICs play in delivering the disease-promoting proteins inside plant cells. Discovery of specific protein motifs that target secretion or translocation of effector proteins will allow us to use the available fungal genome sequence to identify, for the first time, a complete set of effectors from a fungal plant pathogen. Understanding effector secretion systems used by a fungus to control living plant cells, and identifying effectors that mediate this control will provide new targets for protecting agricultural crops from disease. Additionally, some effectors also contribute to resistance by interacting with cognate resistance genes and triggering the plant?s powerful hypersensitive response to block disease.

241,"In a 2004 report to the Office of Biomass Program (DOE-EERE), Itaconic acid was identified as one of the top 12 value added chemicals from biomass. Yet its polymerization was identified as a key barrier to commercial development. This technical barrier was recently overcome by the University of New Hampshire and licensed to Itaconix. The resulting biobased material polyitaconic acid (PIA) is a water soluble polymer with a wide range of applications including superabsorbents (SAP), anti-scaling agents in water treatments, co-builders in detergents, and dispersants for minerals in coatings. Polyitaconic Acid is also being evaluated by as an amendment for soil retention and nutrient delivery. It is an attractive replacement to the well established polyacrylic acid (PAA), a petrochemical. To penetrate the commodity market, PIA must have a target cost competitive to PAA. Recently, PIA has been produced by Itaconix using commercial itaconic acid obtained by the fermentation of dextrose typically derived from corn or rice. Under such non integrated structure, PIA can be produced at a cost of $3/Kg. In order to displace PAA it must reach a production cost below $1.5/Kg. An integrated approach is proposed using a low cost raw material such as xylan, produced by a biorefinery of the type encountered in the Kraft wood pulp manufacturing process. The investigating collaborative team has preliminary data indicating the strong likelihood of such an integrated approach being successful.

242,"Aluminum (Al) is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and in highly acidic soils (pH<5) is solubilized as the trivalent cation, which is very phytotoxic to plant roots. Al toxicity is the primary limitation to crop production on approximately 50% of the world's potentially arable lands, including ~20% of North America as well as in many developing countries, where food security is most tenuous. Rice is a staple crop for half the world's population and is a major U.S. agricultural export. Rice is significantly more Al tolerant than other grasses, including maize, wheat and sorghum, but our understanding of the genetic, molecular and physiological mechanisms of rice Al tolerance is still limited. With higher levels of Al tolerance and abundant genetic and genomic resources, rice is a good model to investigate cereal Al tolerance. The goal of this research is to identify the major genes involved in Al resistance in rice and provide a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms of Al resistance. The activities outlined in this proposal will allow us to: 1) Identify, clone, and characterize the gene(s) underlying a major and novel rice Al tolerance QTL we have recently identified. 2) Develop near isogenic lines (NILs) containing the major Al tolerance QTL for use in breeding and physiological studies. 3) Conduct full-genome association mapping using 500 O. sativa and O. rufipogon genotypes to identify novel chromosomal regions (50-500kb) conferring Al tolerance in rice. 4) Determine and characterize the physiological mechanism(s) underlying rice Al tolerance. The findings from the proposed research on the elucidation of the molecular and physiological basis of the very high Al tolerance expressed in rice, will allow for more efficient breeding of acid soil-tolerant rice varieties and also provide important new molecular and genetic resources for improving acid soil tolerance of cereal crops in general.

243,"A multi-disciplinary team at the University of Missouri-Delta Research Center will conduct field and greenhouse experiments with drill-seeded and water-seeded rice. The overall goal of this research is to improve management systems and irrigation water use for rice production in the upper Mississippi River Delta Region. This project will seek to increase yields and milling properties, reduce input costs of rice production, and protect the environment in rice fields and surrounding streams. Rice production has a positive impact on the communities in the upper Mississippi Delta region. In addition to providing income for farmers in the region, rice production helps create jobs for workers at agricultural chemical dealerships, crop consultants, and employees of a rice mill located at New Madrid, Missouri. This project will compare methods of lowering irrigation costs for flood irrigated rice by improving pump and motor/engine efficiencies, reducing inlet pressures, and improving overall system efficiencies. Rice water weevil infestations in production fields vary depending on flood depth. Tests will study the effect of irrigation flood depth and seed treatments on rice water weevil control. The use of center pivot sprinkler irrigated rice has the potential to reduce the amount of water needed for rice. However, weed control may be more difficult. Research with sprinkler irrigation will be conducted with new rice varieties and hybrids which contain a technology which permits broadcast applications of imidazolinone herbicides.

244,"Adequate iron uptake by crop plants is necessary for optimizing crop yields and for ensuring that edible crops contain adequate amounts of iron for the diets of both humans and livestock. Iron nutritional status of crop plants is determined both by the efficiency with which they can take up iron from the soil, and the efficiency with which they use iron within their organs and tissues. The Gramineae (grasses), which are among the world's most important crop plants (e.g., rice, maize, and wheat), take up iron by a mechanism that is fundamentally different from that of other plant species. Evidence is accumulating that grasses also accomplish internal iron translocation using mechanisms that are distinct from those used by non-grasses.

245,"Develop appropriate strategies and tactics to stem influx of exotic species and/or eliminate extent of non-indigenous species. The problem opportunity: Most invasive snails can be injurious to vegetation, destroying beneficial agricultural plants, as well as upsetting fragile ecosystems. Taro in Hawai'i represents a $2.2 million annual crop (as in 2005); feeding ten's of thousands of families. This traditional Hawaiian crop is under threat by an invasive snail, Pomacea canaliculata (Apple Snail). Uncontrolled infestation brings agricultural destabilization (~18-25% crop loss) and economic impact on Hawaiian families and neighboring communities within the South Pacific were Taro is a main staple. The impact of this invasive snail on rice production cannot be underestimated, with potential crop losses affecting 100's of millions of people in South-East Asia (see Naylor 1996), this illustrates the potential far reaching implications for this proposal. Here or on mainland USA invasive snail control has been ineffective, resulting in P. canaliculata's increased destructive distribution which now greatly impacts native wetlands. Alternative approaches to combating invasive snails proliferation, crop and habitat destruction need to be investigated. Phyla-selective, environmentally friendly, biodegradable, non-residual forming pesticide targeting opportunities are presently limited within invasive snails. Recently reports cite the use of small cyclic plant-derived peptide bioactives, Katala B1 and B2 (see Plan et al. 2008), which demonstrated peptide-pesticide potential against P. canaliculata (LD50 ~53uM). These peptides were more potent then the commonly employed synthetic molluscicide metaldehyde (LD50 ~133uM). This confirms our approach of using bioactive peptides as novel molluscicide agents, even if the precise physiological target(s) is unknown. Yet a more formidable source of snail selective inhibitory peptides demonstrating a stronger ecological correlation and effectiveness against the invasive phyla (LD50 ranges 8nM- 50pM), resides within the venoms of the Cone Shell. These tropical carnivorous predatory marine snails have evolved the use of small cyclic bioactive peptides, similar to Katala B1/B2, to immobilize and kill prey. Specifically Hawaiian molluscivorous Cone Shells represent an untapped library of peptides that specifically target conserved physiological mechanisms within snails. These mechanisms represent novel targets for agricultural molluscicide development.

246,"Rice is an important crop in the southern U.S. The rice stink bug, is the most widespread late-season insect pest of rice in the southern U.S. Adults and nymphs of this insect remove the contents of developing rice grains using their piercing-sucking mouthparts. Feeding by rice stink bugs can result in reductions in both yield and grain quality, but, at infestation levels typically found in commercial rice fields, reduction in grain quality is probably the more important of the two types of damage. Reduction in grain quality takes the form of chalky, discolored areas around the sites of feeding, which is referred to as  peck . Management programs for the rice stink bug are similar in their broad outlines throughout the south and, although there is some regional variation in practices used, all of these programs are outdated and inadequate. As a result, it is highly likely that current management programs for the rice stink bug are not cost-effective or sustainable, and are probably more environmentally damaging than they should be. This study is intended to characterize methods currently used by farmers across the south to manage the rice stink bug, to evaluate the sustainability of these methods, to evaluate current recommendations regarding the use of insecticides against the rice stink bug, and to generate data on the effectiveness of new insecticides against the rice stink bug. Information and new recommendations will delivered via a variety of methods, and a post-study survey will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of this project in changing farmer practices.

247,"The rice stink bug, Oebalus pugnax, is the most important late-season insect pest of rice in the southern United States. Adults and nymphs of this insect remove the contents of developing rice grains using their piercing-sucking mouthparts. Feeding by rice stink bugs can result in reductions in both yield and grain quality, but, at infestation levels typically found in commercial rice fields, reduction in grain quality is probably the more important type of damage. Management programs for the rice stink bug throughout the south are outdated and inadequate, and there is a compelling need for re-evaluation and revision of all aspects of the rice stink bug management programs used throughout the south. This need can be summarized in five points: First, insufficient information on the incidence and severity of stink bug infestations and on insecticide use patterns is available to generate precise estimates of economic impacts of stink bugs; second, the insecticides used against rice stink bugs are damaging to the environment and/or human health, and heavy use of these insecticides may be leading to the development of insecticide resistance; third, the economic thresholds used to guide applications of insecticides were generated using varieties, market conditions and agronomic practices that are now obsolete, and recent evidence from Texas strongly suggests that these thresholds should be substantially higher; fourth, there is a need for further evaluation of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are less damaging to the environment and have longer residual activities than currently used insecticides; and fifth, there is a need to begin to evaluate non-chemical alternatives for stink bug management. The overall goal of the proposed extension work is to improve rice stink bug management programs in southern rice-producing states by facilitating the anticipated adoption of neonicotinoid insecticides, and by educating stakeholders with respect to these changes. Pre- and post-study surveys will be developed and delivered to stakeholders in the South to assess the current status of rice stink bug management programs and (after the proposed funding period) to evaluate the rate of adoption of new recommendations. Rice stink bug density-damage relationships will be characterized to allow the generation of revised economic thresholds for stink bugs, and the influence of rice variety on stink bug damage will be investigated, as a first step in understanding the potential role of plant resistance in rice stink bug management programs. The efficacies and residual activities of dinotefuran and clothianidin (two neonicotioids) against the rice stink bug will be evaluated. Finally, the feasibility of tank-mixing a neonicotinoid and a fungicide and applying the tank mix at early stages of rice heading will be assessed. Successful completion of the integration of new, higher, thresholds and new insecticides into management programs will result in programs that are more cost-effective and less damaging to the environment and human health than current programs.

248,"Problem: This project will demonstrate the applicability of using rice bran and rice bran extract as a commercial scale growth medium for yeast. Currently, the production of yeast is carried out on a high sugar starting medium composed of beet or cane molasses, both of which are in short supply and command high prices. The innovative process proposed by Nutraceutical Innovations uses as a starting medium heat-stabilized defatted rice bran (HDRB), a low cost, typically underutilized co-product from the rice milling industry. Rice bran is available in large supply (1.6 billion lbs annually in the U.S. alone)(USDA, 2003), but has little commercial value in the food industry largely because of its indigestibility and unpalatability. Although the unprocessed bran byproduct has little value ?as is,? it does serve as a rich source of nutraceutical oil, and it can be processed to remove the rice bran oil. Commercially, when the oil is extracted, the rice bran undergoes a heat stabilization step to preserve the quality of the oil. The resulting by-product after oil extraction is called heatstabilized defatted rice bran (HDRB), a potentially rich source of protein, starch, fiber, vitamins and minerals with nutraceutical health benefits. The potential commercial and health benefits of HDRB, although significant, are largely unrealized because of the lack of sound scientific investigation into the applications for HDRB as a functional food ingredient. Currently, HDRB is primarily used as a filler in animal feed, and commands a sales price of only $0.03/pound. Proteins, phenolics, and bioactive molecules are bound and unavailable. Nutraceutical Innovations, Inc. recognizes both the economic and nutritional potential of HDRB, and is developing novel, value added processing methods for HDRB from which extracts can be derived, allowing for the development of new food ingredients with health benefits. The process under development has direct applicability to the yeast production industry, and if successfully commercialized, promises significant economic benefits over the current process. The proposed process utilizes the HDRB to produce co-products that will have significant value in the market, and provide health benefits to the consumer. Purpose: The overall objective of the Phase II effort is to develop and test a cost-competitive process for producing yeast and co-products using HDRB extracts as a growth medium. Successful completion of the project objectives will produce a minimum of 30-logs of growth of up to 4 strains of yeast in HDRB extracts, and at least two coproducts with viability for use as beneficial food additives. The broad vision of Nutraceutical Innovations is to develop a spectrum of commercially valuable products from HDRB using the patent pending total systems approach. The conceived commercial opportunities range from relatively low risk products and processes with ready markets (e.g. licensing the patent pending process that uses HDRB as the energy and nutrient source for the production of yeast) to potentially promising but untested product concepts (e.g. anti-cancer therapeutics from fermentation extracts).

249,"This project aims to generate one of the largest and most useful databases of diversity information for any crop in the world. By providing a large repository of information about the precise location of 600,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rice, as well as the occurrence of particular SNP alleles in 850 diverse rice samples, it will enable breeders to readily select sub-sets of informative SNPs for use on smaller, in-house platforms for immediate applications in marker-assisted or genomic selection. Geneticists will be able to access the information to identify sets of genome-wide polymorphisms for use in high throughput quantitative trait locus (QTL) and association mapping experiments or to select highly targeted sets of SNPs for high-resolution haplotype analysis and gene discovery. Scientists will be able to interrogate the data to learn more about the role of methylation in regulating plant response to both internal, developmental signals as well as external, environmental cues, opening up an exciting new domain of opportunity for selecting on epigenetic variation in plant improvement. The availability of a high density SNP chip for rice will make it possible to undertake large-scale, high-throughput germplasm characterization, enhancing the value of the genetic resources available in the world's major germplasm repositories. This, in turn, will enhance our ability to more efficiently utilize germplasm resources for improving the sustainability of US agriculture. Analysis of the data generated on this project and availability of the SNP chip to genotype additional rice accessions and samples in future experiments will deepen our understanding of how diversity is partitioned and distributed in the rice genome, pointing the way toward a more rational basis for exploiting natural variation in crop improvement. Understanding the evolutionary history underlying the diversity we observe today will also generate new insights about the synthesis of novel alleles that can expand the repertoire of useful traits in the future. Finally, the ability to link sequence and diversity information to physiological functions, plant development and agronomic traits in rice will greatly expand the foundation for comparative genomics using rice as a pivotal reference genome. As a result, this project will lay the groundwork for related applications in other major crop species.

250,"Wheat and rice provide approximately half of the calories consumed directly by humans. Increase productivity of these two important crops is important to satisfy the continuous increase in worldwide demand for cereals. One of the fastest ways to improve wheat and rice yield is to reduce losses due to pathogens, which claim every year a significant part of the global wheat and rice production. Just in the U.S. an average of 21 million bushels of wheat are being lost per year due to stripe rust and 30 million bushels to leaf rust. The recent appearance of new stem rust races in Africa that are virulent on currently deployed stem rust resistance genes represents a new threat to the wheat crop. The new races are virulent on most of the stem rust resistance genes currently deployed in the different wheat growing areas of the world. While genetic resistance is a cost-effective and environmentally-sound method of disease control in plants, our current ability to generate durable pyramids of resistance genes against rusts in wheat is limited by our poor understanding of the genetic mechanisms and gene interactions involved in the resistance response in wheat. Race-specific seedling resistance genes provide only temporary protection because fungal populations rapidly evolve to overcome this type of resistance. In contrast, race non-specific resistance provides partial (quantitative) and more durable resistance. The recent cloning of the broad resistance gene YR36 provides an entry points to investigate the gene network involved in durable resistance. To accelerate the characterization of the pathways regulating disease resistance in wheat we will use the protein-protein interaction information available from rice. Preliminary results show that some of the protein-protein interactions identified in rice are conserved in wheat. We will generate mutants of wheat genes that interact with YR36 and will test their effect on stripe rust resistance. We will also use these mutants to determine the role of these genes in resistance to other types of wheat rust. For example, mutations in the wheat RAR1 gene will be used in crosses to test if a particular rust resistance gene requires or does not require the presence of RAR1 for a proper function. These mutants will facilitate the classification of resistance genes into different functional classes, which can be combined to provide a more durable resistance. The mutants generated in this study will be publicly available and will provide a long-term genetic resource that can be used in the study of other disease resistance genes. A better knowledge of the gene networks responsible for disease resistance is essential to design intelligent strategies to fight wheat pathogens.

251,"The Poaceae are a large family of more than 10,000 species of which, cereals such as wheat, rice, maize, and sorghum serve as a major caloric source for humans and livestock. The Poaceae inhabit a wide range of environmental niches and possess a number of unique morphological, physiological, and developmental processes of agricultural relevance involving floral/fruit development, drought tolerance, and C4 photosynthesis. Diversification of plant morphology and biological function is apparent between taxonomic groups and lineage specific genes are strong candidates underpinning this diversity. We have identified a set of highly conserved lineage specific genes within the Poaceae, termed Conserved Poaceae Specific Genes (CPSGs). The majority of CPSGs lack a known function and we will augment their annotation by determining their expression pattern across four Poaceae species with genome sequence, rice, sorghum, maize and Brachypodium. We will test the function of a subset of CPSGs using experimental approaches with a standardized set of metrics for floral/seed development and yield. As the CPSGs are restricted to the Poaceae, understanding their function would provide a powerful resource to identify genes that distinguish Poaceae from other plant taxa and have the potential to provide seminal insight into the molecular mechanisms that are critical to the unique morphology, development, and physiological capabilities of the Poaceae, phenotypes important to agriculture.

This EIPM-CS Coordination proposal includes the Emphasis Areas of Agronomic Crops, High-Value/High-Input Crops, Consumer/Urban IPM and Wide-Area Pest Monitoring and Reporting. Commodities included in the IPM program include rice, soybean, corn, sorghum, cotton, pecans, and vegetables; we also will deliver programming on fire ants to urban constituents. The proposed project is based largely on the recent success we have had in delivering locally based IPM demonstrations through a competitive county-level mini-grants program - more than 50% of the proposed funding is dedicated to the mini-grants program. In addition to the county-based program, we also will participate in the national ipmPIPE program, with monitoring and disseminating information about Asian soybean rust.

254,"The goal of the proposed project is to improve the performance and economic utility of sorghum as a feedstock for ethanol production. High productivity sorghum as an ethanol feedstock will benefit the environment by reducing greenhouse gases and will benefit rural areas of the U.S. by stimulating local production of a high-value crop and associated ethanol refineries. Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. has identified rice genes that adapted during rice domestication. We have shown that these genes have multiple effects on yield and other commercially important traits in rice lines and hybrids. We have identified equivalents of these rice genes native to other Grass family species (corn and barley), and have shown that these genes control yield and other traits in these species as well. Sorghum is a member of the Grass family, so we hypothesize the equivalent genes native to sorghum may control commercially important traits in sorghum, such as yield of grain, sugar, and biomass. We will evaluate the sorghum candidate genes for association with these traits. We will sequence the sorghum candidate genes in a panel of 200 sorghum lines, and perform allelic association analysis to detect trait associations. If successful, these genes should be excellent tools for breeding higher yielding sorghum and for genetically engineering sorghum using natural or derived alleles of genes that are native to sorghum, which should be more environmentally acceptable than genetically modified plants involving foreign genes.

The specific objectives include the development of modular simulators for major U.S. crops, and evaluation of environmental impacts of global climate change, water quality issues, sustainable agriculture, precision farming, etc.  Research areas where knowledge gaps about plant and soil processes limit the accuracy of model predictions.Approach:Develop a suite of process level crop simulation models for wheat, potatoes, corn, rice, peanut, cotton, and soybean; and integrate these with models for weeds, diseases, and insects.  There are many crop models available; however to date there is no comprehensive crop management system developed for major crops grown in the United States.  The selected crops are important to the U.S. economy; in addition they represent a wide range of plant types:  C3 and C4, grain root and fiber, legume, and non-legume.  From such a suite of models it should be possible to assemble modules capable of simulating many other crops with appropriate parameter changes and additional rate equations to fill up the gaps.

256,"Objective(s): Dietary factors may significantly impact long-term human health during adult life as a result of the influences on early developmental events.  Certain common dietary factors appear to be capable of affecting growth and development; transiently and permanently altering metabolism; influencing body composition; and preventing some diseases.  For example, fruits, vegetables, grains, and milk contain natural compounds (phytochemicals, peptides, and proteins) that can alter development, physiology, and metabolism, which can ultimately lead to disease prevention and phenotypic changes.  Additionally isoflavones are particularly concentrated in soybeans and can have many of the same actions as the major female hormones in women, the estrogens. Countries with regular consumption of large amounts of soy foods report lower incidence of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and obesity; and factors in soy (isoflavones and peptides) are postulated as being partially responsible. The objectives of our research include: 1) determine the effects of diet and physical activity in humans and animal models on development and organ function; 2) determine how early exposure to soy proteins and fruits confers resistance to chronic diseases such as mammary cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes in later adult life; 3) evaluate multiple molecular mechanisms and identify bioactive components for chronic disease prevention by diets using appropriate models as measured by tumor suppressors and oncogenes; oxidative modification; inflammation; immunomodulation; and insulin sensitivity; 4) examine consequences of early intake of combinations of foods (soy, fruits) on chronic disease prevention, organ development and signaling pathways, relative to dietary intake of a single food; 5) investigate the mechanisms of maternal obesity-induced fetal programming; 6) examine the impact of type and amount of dietary macronutrient components on development of obesity and associated metabolic sequence in an animal model of pediatric total enteral nutrition and in clinical studies; 7) identify the potential of dietary factors for mitigating risk of obesity via nutritional programming; and 8) determine the effects of genetic and epigenetic interactions with diet, nutritional status, weight gain, and behavior during gestation on placental and offspring development, health and susceptibility to chronic diseases, including obesity.  It is essential to ascertain the long-term health consequences, both positive and negative, of early consumption of these phytochemicals since it may impact a major segment of our American population.Approach:Studies will focus on the various dietary factors found in foods commonly consumed by children, such as infant formula, fruits, rice, milk, and soy, to determine their long-term health effects in infants and children.  We will analyze how the early exposure to protein sources and fruits normally consumed by infants and children prevents the initiation of and protects against chronic diseases by altering tissue differentiation, inflammation, and/or oxidative status. We will use animal models to mechanistically address the molecular and cellular pathways regulated by intake of various dietary factors (such as in soy foods, berries, grains and milk) in mammary tissue, aorta, liver, adipose tissue, pancreas, and skeletal muscle; identify tissue and serum biomarkers of healthy status associated with these diets; and provide new molecular targets and processes underlying chronic diseases that may be influenced by proper nutrition.  Additional work will be undertaken in an observational study of infants from birth to age 6 years, The Beginnings Study. Breast-fed, milk formula-fed, and soy formula-fed children are studied for growth, development, body composition, and metabolism.  In addition, bone development, and immune system development and function will be studied in children, and animal models will be utilized to explore molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of early dietary exposures.  The rat model will be used to understand the parental genetic transmission of the susceptibility to high fat feeding to future generations and underlying molecular, biochemical, and endocrine mechanisms, in the offspring. Work will be accomplished by evaluating critical periods of development and vulnerable stages of life (i.e. the nutritional status of women at the moment of conception; nutritional and developmental issues during pregnancy and lactation) and the development of eating behaviors during childhood, adolescence, and later stages of life. 6 year old; Address; Adipose tissue; Adolescence; Adult; Affect; American; Animal Model; Aorta; Behavior; Berry; Biochemical; Biological Markers; Birth; Body Composition; Bone Development; Breast Feeding; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cereals; Child; Child Development; Childhood; Chronic Disease; Clinical Research; Conceptions; Consumption; Country; critical period; Development; Diet; Dietary Factors; Dietary intake; Disease; disorder prevention; Eating Behavior; Endocrine; Enteral Nutrition; Epigenetic Process; Estrogens; Event; Exposure to; Fatty acid glycerol esters; feeding; Female; fetal programming; Food; Fruit; fruits and vegetables; Future Generations; Genetic; Growth and Development function; Health; Hormones; Human; Immune system; immunoregulation; Incidence; Infant; Infant formula; Inflammation; insulin sensitivity; Intake; Isoflavones; Lactation; Lead; Life; Liver; Macronutrients Nutrition; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary gland; Mammary Neoplasms; Measures; Metabolic; Metabolism; Milk; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Molecular Target; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; nutrition; Nutritional; Nutritional status; Obesity; obesity risk; Observational Study; offspring; Organ; Pancreas; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Physical activity; Physiology; Phytochemical; Population; Predisposition; Pregnancy; prevent; Process; programs; Proteins; Rattus; Relative (related person); Reporting; Research; Resistance; Rice; Serum; Signal Pathway; Source; soy; Soy Foods; Soy Milk; soy protein isolate; Soy Proteins; Soybeans; Staging; Systems Development; Tissue Differentiation; Tissues; transmission process; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Weight Gain; Woman; WorkIMPACT OF EARLY DIETARY FACTORS ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06

These same plant species will also be grown with supplemental silicon in the fertilizer solution or incorporated into the substrate as rice hulls or Si-containing slags, and inoculated with the same pathogens or expose them to elevated Cu concentrations in the rootzone to determine if Si plays a role in a plantÆs ability to withstand pathogen attack and Cu toxicity.  Plants grown in different amounts of light and exposed to the aforementioned pathogens will be monitored with various sensors (e.g. digital cameras, infrared temperature probes, fluorometers, chlorophyll meters) and molecular tools to detect initial onset of stress symptoms.  Finally, the production methods developed within these tests can be incorporated into the existing computer decision support software Virtual Grower to help growers make decisions in crop management.

259,"Agriculture uses chemical fertilizers to achieve the highest crop yields possible. However, their adverse effects show the clear need to change production methods to achieve sustainability, economic success, conservation of natural resources and avoidance of adverse disturbances to the agroecosystem and neighboring centers of human population. Plant-associated microbes can help to increase grain yields world wide without compromising food production to accommodate population growth by improving the success of sustainable agricultural practices that use biological processes to enhance the crop's output without irreparably damaging the natural resource base where the crop can be grown. Some soil microbes are admirably suited for use in  biofertilization  programs that boost crop yields while reducing chemical fertilizers in biosafe and sustainable ways. Cereals are the major source of food for human nutrition. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is most prominent staple diet for the world's population. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is 2nd in importance as a major carbohydrate source. Their high grain production has only been possible with high N fertilizer inputs. The environmental problems associated with inorganic fertilizer usage could be mitigated if the cereal crops established a more direct and intimate association with beneficial bacteria that promote their growth and increase their grain yield while simultaneously reducing their dependence on chemical N-fertilizer inputs. Although some agricultural biofertilizers (e.g., Rhizobium for legumes, Azospirillum for wheat, and cyanobacteria for rice) are already used in crop production, none till now have satisfactorily replaced the full fertilizer N demand to maximize yield potentials under field conditions. Therefore, discovery and development of more effective biofertilizers that can reduce the dependence on chemical N-fertilizer inputs to maximize cereal crop yields is a high priority area to help achieve the goals of sustainable agriculture worldwide. Our development of new, reliable agricultural biofertilizers addresses the important real-world problem of limited biologically available N in cereal crop production and shows that exploitation of natural beneficial plant-microbe associations is environmentally sound and has high intrinsic probability for success. We will continue basic research to increase knowledge of beneficial plant-microbe interactions of agricultural importance, especially those involving Rhizobium and cereal crops, and utilize this knowledge in real-world, sustainable agroecosystems. The expected outcomes will provide crucial information needed to succeed in implementing environmentally sound, biofertilizer inoculants into sustainable agroecosystems. Major beneficiaries of the applied information are Ag extension agents, low-income farmers in developing and 3rd-world countries who commonly produce cereal crops on marginally fertile soils but cannot afford to utilize chemical fertilizers, and worldwide manufacturers of biofertilizer inoculants in both the general and private sectors.

260,"The focus of this Hatch project proposal is the investigation of the physiological bases for phenotype-level responses of rice to abiotic and biotic stresses. A major aspect will focus on defining the combination of phenotypic traits to select when breeding for increased grain yield in rice. The approach described herein was developed for inbred rice phenotype selection based on previous research by the authors on cotton, rice, and tomatoes. An important aspect of the proposed research will identify which primary phenotypic traits of hybrids exhibit positive heterosis (hybrid vigor) and which can be predicted based on primary phenotypic traits of the inbred parents. We will determine whether our model-assisted inbred rice cultivar selection program can be expanded to include a parental selection component that focuses on optimizing hybrid yield performance. Our research has led to the development of a physiologically based rice crop simulation model that we are using in a major part of the Texas rice breeding program to define the  best  combination of plant traits to achieve increased grain yield for a given set of environmental conditions. Six years of field data combined with simulation results suggest that yield can be increased by selecting for genotypes having combinations of traits that promote rapid early vegetative growth, followed by a high level of accumulation of grain mass. Model-assisted selection used in conjunction with marker-assisted selection for grain quality and disease resistance has allowed the Texas rice breeding program to identify desirable inbred genotypes, with the release of the first model/marker-assisted selected rice cultivar scheduled for 2010. Interestingly, all of the primary phenotypic traits identified as being required to produce a superior yielding inbred cultivar are found in the new slate of commercial hybrids that have recently been commercialized for the U.S. rice production market. This convergence of what might be called an ideotype for both inbred and hybrid selection is encouraging in that it suggests the underlying basis for superior yield performance can be obtained, at least in part, using the same selection criteria for both inbreds and hybrids. Predicting the outcome of particular crosses are difficult when selecting for either inbreds or hybrids. There are two major challenges for a wide cross hybrid cultivar development program. The first is identifying parents that are widely compatible that overcome hybrid sterility, which is common in rice, and the second is accurately predicting yield performance based on the phenotypic characteristics of the parents. The feasibility of the latter is unknown and additional research is needed to identify which primary phenotypic traits in a hybrid can be predicted based on the parental phenotypes and which cannot be predicted. However, even when heterosis is not predictable based on parental traits, it is possible to predict yield performance based on a hybrid's primary phenotypic traits, similar to what we have been able to do with inbred cultivars. base; Breeding; Cereals; Characteristics; Data; Development; Disease Resistance; Exhibits; Genotype; Gossypium; Growth; hatching; Hybrid Vigor; Hybrids; Inbreeding; Investigation; Marketing; Modeling; models and simulation; Outcome; Parents; Performance; Phenotype; Physiological; Plants; Production; Program Development; programs; Research; response; Rice; Schedule; Selection Criteria; simulation; Sterility; Stress; Texas; Tomatoes; traitPHYSIOLOGICAL BASES FOR PHENOTYPE-LEVEL RESPONSES OF HYBRID RICE TO ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC STRESSES",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999
261,"Genome research has been demonstrated to provide new and powerful tools for accelerated plant genetic improvement and for enhanced productivity and effectiveness of crop production, and simultaneously address ecological concerns in agricultural production and utilization. The goals of this project are [1] to develop advanced genomic resources, infrastructure, technologies and tools for discovery, tagging and cloning of agronomic genes in crop plants, and [2] to use the tools and systems developed to identify and characterize the genes of agricultural importance and to advance the body of knowledge in crop genomics. In the previous period of this project, we have developed advanced genomic resources, infrastructure, technologies and tools essential for large-scale and high-throughput discovery, tagging and cloning of agronomic genes in most of major crops, including cotton, maize, soybean, rice and wheat. In this period of the project, we will focus our research on its second goal: Use the tools and systems that we developed to identify and characterize the genes of agricultural importance and to advance the body of knowledge in crop genomics. Particularly, we will develop integrated physical/genetic maps of turkey, chickpea, cotton and melon; develop tools and strategies to associate gene activities or expression with trait performance, thus crop yield and quality, in cotton and maize; further develop the DNA  Jigsaw Puzzle  structure model that we discovered previously, with which we expect to provide a deeper understanding of the abundance, diversity and complexity of living organisms using Arabidopsis, rice, yeast, and human as experimental models; and on the basis of the DNA  Jigsaw Puzzle  structure model, study the underlying molecular mechanisms of genome evolution using Gossypium, Oryza, Glycine, and birds (chicken and turkey) as experimental models. These experiments, once accomplished successfully, will not only provide powerful platform and  freeways  essential for advanced research of genomics, genetics and breeding in turkey, chickpea, cotton and melon, and allow identification of numerous genes that are involved in high-yield and high-quality maize grain and cotton fiber production, but importantly, will also provide novel molecular basis of the abundance, diversity and complexity of living organisms observed on earth, thus revolutionizing our current knowledge, concepts and strategies of genetics, genomics, breeding and medicine research.

262,"Agricultural chemicals can help us produce food and fiber. Although these chemicals are tested extensively before coming to market, they may meet environmental conditions that would either decrease their effectiveness or increase their persistence beyond what is desired. This can occur as a result of a specific set of unexpected environmental conditions. We have the facilities and instruments to conduct tests to determine the effect of different soil types, soil moisture, temperature, acidity, plus other variables or combinations of variables have on the fate of these compounds. When the cause for the effect is found, remediation procedures can be implemented. Rainwater gardens have been shown to be effective at removing sediment from runoff water, but they are less effective at removing dissolved compounds such as urban lawn care chemicals and oils in runoff water from parking lots and streets. These compounds are not well retained by soil and have the potential to leach resulting in ground water contamination. Crushed charcoal has been shown to be very effective at removing organic compounds from water, similar to a household filter used to filter drinking water. Adding crushed charcoal to rainwater gardens may retain many of these easily leached compounds and prevent them from reaching ground water. Clomazone is a herbicide that is effective for controlling barnyardgrass in rice. Over the past several years, instances of barnyardgrass developing resistance to clomazone have developed. To overcome this resistance, we need to understand how it is developing. Measuring the fate of clomazone and it's metabolite 5-ketoclomazone in both susceptible and resistant barnyardgrass will help us understand what is happening in the plant. This may help us combat the resistance. There is evidence that the metabolite 5-ketoclomazone is the actual compound that kills the barnyardgrass. If that is true, then 5-ketoclomazone or compounds similar in structure may be effective herbicides. First, tests need to be made in the greenhouse to see if the 5-keto form truly is effective. If it is, then further tests will need to be performed as with any other pesticide to determine if it is marketable.

263,"A better understanding of how wild plants were turned into crops holds tremendous potentials for developing more effective methods for crop improvement and new domestications. Particularly, as we are facing rapid global environmental changes, the need for modifying our food crops and for developing new crops, such as energy crops, to meet the challenges of food, energy, and environmental securities has grown increasingly urgent. Rice, one of the model plants for biological and agricultural research of cereals and other grasses, provides an ideal system for further investigation of the genetic basis of domestication. A particularly relevant question to crop improvement and domestication has been recently brought to the focus of my research. That is, how many genes were involved in a critical domestication transition I found that the modification of an essential domestication trait, such as shattering or threshing, was controlled primarily by a single gene during the domestication of a cereal crop. Based on this finding, I proposed the  one gene for one trait  hypothesis (Sang, Plant Physiology, in press). This could be attributed to strong artificial selection on a limited number of suitable genes for phenotypic changes that essentially turned a wild species into a crop. It implies that a drastic phenotypic modification for improving an existing crop or domesticating a new crop can potentially be achieved by selecting or inducing mutations of one gene. However, it may take a lot of work to come across or engineer such mutations because the number of target genes can be small. In the next few years, I will continue to search and characterize genes controlling the phenotypic changes that made agriculture possible. With the growth of the number of genes identified in rice and other cereals, we can further test the hypothesis and generalize the theory, which will in turn provide a more powerful guidance for our future effort to improve and domesticate crops, especially through the assistance of modern biotechnology.

264,"From 2001-2003, an average of 7% to 15% of the major world crops (wheat, rice potatoes, maize and soybean) were lost due to diseases caused by fungi and bacteria. Monetary losses due to soilborne diseases in the U.S. are estimated to exceed $4 billion per year, and losses due to parasitic nematodes exceed $100 billion per year world wide. The cost of soilborne plant pathogens to society and the environment far exceeds the direct costs to growers and consumers. The use of chemical pesticides to control soilborne pathogens has caused significant changes in air and water quality, altered natural ecosystems resulting in direct and indirect affects on wildlife, and caused human health problems. For example, methyl bromide, a fumigant used to control soilborne diseases, has become notorious in recent years for contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. Consumers are demanding plentiful low cost but safe food while simultaneously requiring the use of fewer chemical controls. From 2000 to 2005, the number of organic acres in the U.S. increased 128%, to around 4 million acres. Organically-grown crops require non-synthetic methods for management of diseases, and organic growers are seeking scientifically-based disease management methods. The recent spike in food prices due to increased demand and decreased supply further necessitate the development of sustainable methods of disease management. This project directly addresses these problems in a multistate, multidisciplinary approach. The promise, public acceptance and environmental benefits of non-chemical management of root diseases continue to make research on this area both timely and of critical importance to the future of U.S. and world agriculture.

265,"(1) Turfgrass improvement by genetic transformation We improved the tissue culture responses of tall fescue, perennial ryegrass and bermudagrass, and are able to transform the three turfgrass species. High efficiency (8%) of genetic transformation was obtained in tall fescue using Agrobacterium-mediated approach. We introduced four genes into tall fescue. Some transgenic plants showed good resistance to the gray leaf spot (Magnaporthe grisea) and/or brown patch (Rhizoctonia solani) diseases. (2) Conventional breeding of St. Augustinegrass for improved freezing tolerance and semi-dwarf growth habit By collecting germplasms, inducing somaclonal variations through tissue culture, and mutagenesis using gamma-ray irradiation, more than 10,000 plant lines were generated for selection. Among those, 2 lines displayed improved freezing tolerance in lab tests and more than 30 lines showed semi-dwarf growth habit (with finer architecture, such as smaller leaves and shorter internodes). These breeding lines are currently in the field trial for further evaluation for new cultivar development. (3) Cloning and characterization of the rice rubi3 promoter We have cloned the promoter of a rice polyubiquitin gene, rubi3, including its 5' UTR intron, and demonstrated that it is a strong promoter. The 5' UTR intron enhances the promoter activity. Modification of the gene constructs further improves transgene expression. (4) Genetic transformation of switchgrass for reduced lignin and increased cellulose content We have developed a protocol to transform switchgrass and have obtained transgenic plants. We have made a gene construct construct for expression reduction of a key gene in an attempt to reduce lignin content, and used it to transform switchgrass. (5) Genetic transformation of tobacco for improved biomass yield A gene for enhancing photosynthesis and a gene that alters photo-assimilate partitioning were used to transform tobacco. The plants are being evaluated in the fields for their yield and potential use as a bioenergy crop. (6) Genetic transformation for altering alkaloids content in tobacco By overexpressing two key genes in nicotine biosynthesis, the project will evaluate the changes in alkaloids, and reveal the relationship among alkaloids synthesis, crop yield, and particulate matter toward development of a safer smoking product. The transgenic plants are being analyzed in the greenhouse as well as in field tests. (7) Applying nano-particles to improvement of transformation efficiency We recently used protamine, which may forms nano-particles with plasmid DNA, to coat DNA for biolistic transformation, and obtained 3-5 fold higher transformation efficiency in both transient assays and stable transformation experiments. 5' Untranslated Regions; Agrobacterium; Alkaloids; Anabolism; Architecture; Biolistics; Biological Assay; Biomass; Breeding; Cellulose; Cloning; Cynodon; Development; Disease; DNA; Evaluation; Freezing; Gamma Rays; Genes; Genetic Transformation; Gray unit of radiation dose; Growth; Habits; improved; Introns; irradiation; Lignin; Lolium; Magnaporthe; Mediating; Modification; Mutagenesis; nanoparticle; Nicotine; overexpression; Particulate Matter; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants; plasmid DNA; Polyubiquitin; Protamines; Protocols documentation; research study; Resistance; response; Rhizoctonia; Rice; Smoking; Spottings; Testing; tissue culture; Tobacco; transgene expression; Transgenic Plants; VariantTURFGRASS BIOTECHNOLOGY",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,6.050462799951615e-05,1e-06
266,"Arkansas has the largest share of the U.S. rice market, accounting for nearly one-half of total U.S. rice production. Many factors impact rice profitability. Domestic farm prices for rice are strongly related to world prices and reflect strong competition in a global market. Government payments play a major role in farm revenues and strongly impact the way rice producers manage their farm operations. Rice production costs are also large relative to other field crops like soybeans or corn and are greatly impacted by prices paid for fuel and fertilizer. The high costs of production for rice reduce producer profit margins and make rice producers largely dependent on government payments to achieve profitability. Rice has the largest water requirement of any row crop in eastern Arkansas. Most irrigation water is supplied by wells tapping into the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer, which underlies nearly all of eastern Arkansas. Large water withdrawals are placing strong downward pressure on this groundwater source. Water quality is also likely to impact Arkansas rice production decisions in the near future. Surface soils contain little organic matter and are comprised of silt and clay particles that are readily transported by runoff from tilled fields during heavy rainfall events. Sediment is the primary pollutant identified for most eastern Arkansas waterways, and practices like no-till are commonly recommended as remedial mechanisms. Producers have a wide range of management options to choose from, including using new rice varieties that are higher yielding or earlier maturing; using conservation tillage practices in place of conventional tillage; changing the rotation cropping sequence to include alternative crops like corn, wheat, or sorghum; improving irrigation efficiency with new irrigation technologies or land forming techniques; or investing in tail-water recovery pits and on-farm reservoirs to supplement groundwater with surface water. Arkansas rice producers have little information about the long-term profitability of management practices that preserve critical resources like land and water. The objective of this research project is to evaluate the long-term economic feasibility of alternative management practices to provide producers with viable options and insure the sustainability of rice and other agronomic crops grown in Arkansas. The results of the project should provide Arkansas farmers and farmland owners with relevant economic information for making better farm management decisions when important production resources like land and water are limiting. The results should also help guide research and extension professionals in the development of better crop management recommendations and should help policy makers better understand the impacts that alternative or competing government policies have on farm economic survival.

267,"Plants are sessile organisms constantly challenged by a wide spectrum of biotic and abiotic stresses. These stresses cause considerable losses in crop yields worldwide, while the demand for food and energy is on the rise. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving stress responses is crucial to devising targeted strategies to engineer stress-tolerant plants. To determine the role of oxygenated fatty acids in mediating direct and indirect plant-defense responses we have generated a number of transgenic plants lacking the two crucial products of oxylipin pathway, namely aldehydes and jasmoninc acids. Specifically, we generated Arabidopsis genotypes lacking either one or both of these metabolites. These genotypes were subsequently challenged with a phloem-feeding insect (aphids Myzus persicae), an insect herbivore (leafminers Liriomyza trifolii), and two different necrotrophic fungal pathogens (Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola). We also characterized the volatiles emitted by these plants upon aphid infestation or mechanical wounding and identified hexenyl acetate as the predominant compound in these volatile blends. Subsequently, we examined the signaling role of this compound in attracting the parasitoid wasp (Aphidius colemani), a natural enemy of aphids.

268,"Oklahoma is the second largest producer of winter wheat in the U.S. (NASS 2007). Stored product losses resulting from insect infestation are extensive and are usually associated with the occurrence of internal feeders such as lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica Fabricious) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and rice weevils (Sitophilus oryzae Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The reasons why psocids have only recently risen to prominence as serious pests of stored grain in Australia are not fully known. However, it has been suggested that the reduction of residual pesticides to treat grain and structures is a major factor (CSIRO GRL 2003). It's also hypothesized that phosphine and other measures currently used are effective against other insect pests (beetles) but not psocids thereby leaving psocids free from competition and predation (CSIRO GRL 2003). It is also suggested that because psocids are highly mobile insects, they will reinvade fumigated grain before other insects; in the absence of competition and predation, psocid population growth is explosive resulting in spectacular outbreaks (CSIRO GRL 2003). In relation to grain shipments for export, psocid infestation can lead to serious financial penalties. Psocid infestations also lead to significant weight losses in stored grain. They suggest that because psocids erode the surface layers of grains and damage is difficult to see, their status as pests is often underestimated. In ition, infestation of seed grain by psocids can lead to reduced seed germination as a result of psocid preference for grain germ (Kucerova 2002). A major source of concern is the finding that psocid infestations in grain storages, grain processing facilities, and product warehouses could exacerbate other stored-product pest problems (Opit, unpublished data). When psocids are present in large numbers, they taint the food on which they are living, thereby deteriorating the quality of stored commodities (Turner 1994, Kucerova 2002). Psocids also spread spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms and their importance as a health hazard stems from this problem (Kucerova 2002). Psocids are persistent pests in grain storages, grain processing facilities, and product warehouses (Rees and Walker 1990). The reasons they are considered stored-product pests have already been stated. Psocids are highly resistant to entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria; this may be due to cuticular fatty amides that decrease hydrophobicity and static charge, thereby reducing adhesion by microorganisms (Turner 1988, Lord and Howard 2004). The study on diet showed that corn, milo, barley, oats, wheat, and rice are all suitable for rapid multiplication of psocid populations (Opit and Throne 2008b). As already mentioned, little research has been conducted on the biology and ecology of stored-product psocids worldwide and this presents a challenge to the development of effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs to mitigate their economic impact. Without user-friendly sampling protocols that can be recommended by extension personnel and county educators, population-based management programs will not gain widespread acceptance.

269,"Two families of dsRNA viruses, Partitiviridae and Totiviridae, and the genus Endornavirus contain members that infect plants and fungi. In plant pathogenic fungi, these viruses can increase or decrease the virulence of the fungus but in plants they do not appear to cause disease. Whether plant partitiviruses, endornaviruses, or totiviruses can provide beneficial adaptative traits to plants such as pathogen tolerance or tolerance to extreme environmental conditions remains to be investigated. We have found a partitivirus and a totivirus infecting Jalape?o M pepper, and tomato respectively. Virus-free lines of the same cultivars were obtained after screening many Jalapeno pepper and tomato seedlings. In Louisiana two endornaviruses have been reported infecting Yolo Wonder pepper and two rice cultivars (M201 and Saturn). Although, there is no evidence that suggests that these endornaviruses of pepper and rice are pathogenic to these crops; because of the lack of virus-free lines, their host effect of these viruses is not known. Studies related to the effect of these dsRNA viruses on pathogen susceptibility and/or tolerance to extreme environmental conditions of their hosts needs to be investigated as well as their potential use as gene vector. Moreover, the presence of dsRNA viruses in  healthy  crop germplasm could affect international exchanges and sales of rice, tomato or pepper seed. Some fungi contain RNA viruses that have been shown to have potential as biocontrol agents.The best example of this is the hypovirulence caused by dsRNA viruses of Cryphonectria parasitica, the causal agent of chestnut blight. This raises the prospect of using viruses to treat or prevent fungal infections. Research on dsRNA viruses that infect plant pathogenic fungi is essential to determine the mechanisms involved in hypovirulence and therefore facilitate the development of biocontrol strategies. In Louisiana, a putative endornavirus has been found in the plant pathogenic fungus R. solani infecting soybean. Preliminary data suggest that this virus may be involved in the reduced virulence of some isolates of the fungus. The plants hosts for this fungus are economically important and the fungus causes important diseases of rice, cotton, and soybeans. Research on the effect of the putative endornavirus on R. solani should provide some insight into the biocontrol potential of this virus. The overall goal of this proposal is to isolate dsRNA viruses from plants and fungi, obtain the nucleotide sequence of selected isolates, perform phylogenetic studies, and conduct preliminary evaluations on their effect on the hosts. In the case of the research on dsRNA viruses of fungi, the long term goal is to develop biocontrol strategies for fungi infecting economically important crops in Louisiana.

270,"Plants differ in their capacity to grow at and survive low temperatures. At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10C for an extended period; while at the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye that are capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Two key genetic loci are now known to affect winter hardiness, Frost Resistance-1 (FR-1) and FR-2. The FR-1 locus is tightly linked to VRN-1, a gene that determines whether these cereal plants require an extended period of low, nonfreezing temperatures to induce flowering, while FR-2 encompasses a cluster of genes encoding C-Repeat Binding Factor (CBF) proteins, which are DNA binding proteins that activate genetic and biochemical pathways conferring freezing tolerance. A question of fundamental importance in the quest to understand how these cereals survive freezing temperatures is whether FR 1 and VRN 1 are the manifestation of the same gene, or are the affects of two tightly-linked and inseparable genes. Recent studies also indicate that VRN-1/FR-1 is a negative regulator of the CBF genes at FR-2 suggesting that an important aspect of winter hardiness is mediated not only by these two loci but through interactions between them. Multiple lines of evidence also suggest that FR-1 and FR-2 affect drought tolerance, a trait much more difficult to measure, quantify, and breed for than low temperature tolerance. Goals of the work proposed here are (1) to better understand the nature of the interaction between VRN-1/FR-1 and FR-2, (2) to gain greater insight into the regulation of the CBF genes at FR-2 in the absence of the negative affects of VRN-1/FR-1, (3) and to integrate this information with a more complete structural analysis of the FR-2 locus. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that will allow for the enhanced productivity of cereal plants through increased tolerances to freezing and drought conditions.

271,"We are studying a class of biological molecules called  small RNAs . These molecules regulate cellular activities by inhibiting the synthesis or function of longer RNA molecules. This project will identify small RNAs from important crop and model systems, including rice and maize, together representing two of the most important staple foods for the majority of the world's population. Although small RNAs were only found a few years ago to constitute an important regulatory force in animals and plants, several small RNAs have been shown to be associated with plant development and responses to stress. This indicates that small RNAs exist in crop plants such as rice that help plants respond optimally to various environmental and biological stresses. We have developed technologies for identifying and measuring small RNAs at a very large scale. Using this approach, we will identify and measure the changes in the small RNAs that altered in rice in response to different types of environmental or pathogen stress, and understand the mechanisms that regulate the biogenesis or activity of these small RNAs. These small RNAs may regulate other genes during the response to these important stresses. We postulate that some of these small RNAs will be conserved in plant species, and we will test this hypothesis by evaluating several examples from the NPGS using standard techniques. This project has the potential to improve the utility of germplasm in the NPGS with important and novel genetic information about traits of agronomic interest. Because of the similarities among genomes of cereal crops, identification of the genomic locations or genes encoding these small RNAs will also help identify the locations of the homologous genes in other crops such as wheat, and barley.

272,"Dr. Oard has recently developed DNA markers for imazethapyr (Newpath) herbicide resistance and grain aroma in rice. Different combinations of these markers could facilitate breeding efforts for U.S. rice. All public U.S. breeding programs are now using DNA marker technology. The use of markers has shown promise during the development of new populations for Dr. Sha's breeding program. Dr. Oard is a Co-PI in the USDA-funded RiceCAP project to identify DNA markers for sheath blight resistance and whole-grain milling yield. Candidate markers have been identified from RiceCAP that will be evaluated by Dr. Oard against different lines, varieties, and populations. The production of hybrid rice varieties with higher yields over standard inbred varieties is one approach that is gaining momentum in the U.S. rice industry. Dr. Oard has initiated exploratory research for development of certain inbred lines adapted specifically to Louisiana that would be used for development of hybrid rice. New statistical approaches that increase power and precision in data mining and analyses will be part of the proposed research effort in 2008-2012. Sheath blight disease is considered, along with rice blast, as the most economically significant constraint for high yield and quality of rice in Louisiana.

273,"The development and spread of herbicide-resistant weeds, especially those resistant to glyphosate, is an acute concern in agronomic crops in Arkansas. Over the past 5 years, the existence of glyphosate-resistant horseweed (marestail), common and giant ragweed, johnsongrass, and Palmer amaranth have been confirmed. In rice, clomazone-resistant barnyardgrass was confirmed, and although glyphosate is not used in rice, even rice is subject to glyphosate- resistant weeds because of rotation with other crops. Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth is especially alarming because of its potential devastating impact on U.S. row-crop production. It has been estimated that if even 50% of the 169.4 million acres of the cotton, soybean, and corn crops in the U.S. become infested with glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth or hybrids, and assuming the additional management costs to cotton, soybean, and corn producers are the same as the $25.44/acre reported by cotton consultants in Arkansas, the annual cost to producers would be $2.15 billion. However, without the glyphosate technology, the environmental and economic benefits of conservation tillage systems will be in jeopardy. Therefore, Arkansas weed scientists are initiating field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments to develop an understanding of how resistance evolves, how resistant weeds spread, and what recommendations for control of resistant species can be made that can be quickly implemented by producers. We need to determine what mechanisms in a plant allow it to have resistance to a herbicide and how long it takes that resistance to develop and how those weeds spread (e.g., by seed or pollen and by wind, water, equipment, animals, or distribution of crop products) and how quickly. It will also be important to determine the competitive ability, growth rates, emergence timing, and reproductive ability of the resistant weeds of a species (biotypes) compared with the susceptible biotype in order to recommend the most effective weed management plan. The resistance testing program in Arkansas is a valuable resource for producers to get confirmation of suspected resistant plants, level of resistance, and resistance to other herbicides. Its continuation is invaluable for answering questions about distribution and control of resistant weeds. Through this project, control measures for existing resistant weeds and management plans to limit further resistance can be developed, providing Arkansas agriculture with sustainable, economical weed management systems.

276,"Identification insect and related arthropod pests, including newly introduced species, is a critical first step in risk assessment and determining the need for quarantine procedures and new management strategies. The same technologies that serve the needs of collection based systematic research projects also serve the agricultural community by providing an information infrastructure for tracking and documenting pest species distributions, and predicting ecological associations in new areas of occurrence. Even in well studied areas such as eastern U.S., species that turn out to be new to science are discovered. In these cases the species' relationships, as determined through taxonomic study, are useful in predicting biological associations, including host plants and other aspects of natural history. This project will provide essential support roles to agricultural scientists by providing technical expertise for identifying species from difficult species complexes (e.g., Mexican rice borer) or novel technical descriptions of undescribed life history stages (e.g., first description of first instar larvae of the important biocontrol lady beetle, Diomus terminatus). All of these types of studies involve investigations of life histories that are key to understanding potential risks and benefits of new or inadequately studied species. Inventory research under this project will enhance understanding of ecological associations in forested and coastal ecosystems of the southeastern U.S. Specific area of investigation include beetles associated with dead wood substrates in Louisiana and the southern Appalacian Mountains, beetles of Great Smoky Mountians National Park, and insects associated with Spartina grass marshlands in coastal Louisiana. These studies will provide useful baseline data for understanding the value of dead wood in these forests and the potential impacts of insects on management of Spartina in coastal restoration initiatives. Specialized systematic research under this project will provide training to a new generation of insect systematists and document novel findings about the global diversity of inadequately studied insect taxa, their phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeography.

To accomplish these goals, the supply response model for peanuts will be estimated to evaluate the impacts of the agricultural policies on U.S. peanuts and their competitiveness in global markets. In addition, a simulation model will be utilized to assess changes in U.S. domestic policies including macroeconomic factors on the economic viability and competitiveness on 19 U.S. representative peanut farms. Econometric, simulation and spatial equilibrium models will be used to address potential impacts from trade agreements. In addition, export demand models will be developed and estimated to analyze import behavior of peanuts in major importing countries. Important provisions from the DOHA round of WTO will be incorporated into the models to analyze potential impacts. Similar methods will be used to analyze the effects of regional and bilateral trade agreements on U.S. peanuts.

278,"Hundreds of European beeches in the Northeast have been killed by of Phytophthora sp. causing girdling cankers, and about 40 percent of remaining trees show symptoms. P. cactorum and P. citricola cause most of the disease. Recovery of the pathogens in the rhizosphere with conventional baiting has been poor, and we wonder where else they survive and how they move from tree to tree when introduced beech are often separated by miles of non-host land. Inoculations indicate that maple, birch and ash are susceptible but we have only found naturally-infected maple in our surveys. In greenhouse tests, with a few grains of colonized rice as inoculum, P. citricola kills one-year-old beech and we suspect it may do likewise the field. There is precedent for the role of Phytophthora sp. as pathogens of competitive progeny with Prunus spp, and the failure of otherwise shade tolerant beech seedlings to survive beneath parent trees has us wondering if Phytophthora sp are residents of the beech rhizosphere, beneficial to parent trees early on. Expanded soil baiting efforts, root excavation, and close monitoring of the fate of seedlings under the trees should allow us to resolve that question and to identify infection courts. Preliminary treatments of cankers with phosphite fungicide trunk drenches have been encouraging, but not consistent.

281,"This goal of this project is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying fungal growth, development, and pathogenicity using the most advanced molecular genetic, genomic, and proteomic tools available. Using the most advanced tools, we are working to characterize genes and metabolic process that can be exploited to manage fungal disease of plants, insure the safety of food supplies, and enhance the use and efficiency of the bio-base product industry. This project is broken into three sections - protein chips, chromosomal organization, and plant cell wall degrading enzyme studies. Each is briefly described below. In this modern age, a major challenge is to understand control of each gene and the targets of each. This could not be more true for understanding the molecular basis of fungal pathogenicity. The genome sequence of many fungi is now available, as are growing data sets of large-scale studies. We can learn a lot from studying what genes are turned on and off at different time points in development, however the ultimate objective is to be able to decipher the underlying networks controlling these fluxuations. In this project, we will use high throughput proteomic approaches to identify key factors regulating pathogenicity in the rice blast pathogens as well as identify and characterize the subsets of genes they regulate. The fungal genus Alternaria is comprised of many species but is most well known as containing many notoriously destructive plant pathogens. There are over 4,000 Alternaria/host associations recorded ranking it 10th among nearly 2,000 fungal genera based on the total number of host records. Many pathogenic species of Alternaria are prolific toxin producers, which facilitates their killing lifestyle. Genes that code for these toxins in the Alternaria alternata lineages are carried on small, conditionally dispensable chromosomes (CDCs). This project seeks to generate a draft genome sequence assembly from six toxin cluster-containing CDCs and subsequently use that sequence to gain insights into the evolution of host specificity, the transfer of genes, genome structure, and virulence factors for this agronomically important fungal lineage. Plant wall polysaccharides offer unique potential to grow biomass to meet our increasing energy, food, and feed industry needs. Xylans are a large family of polysaccharides essential for the structural integrity of plant cell walls, as well as important substrates for industrial products such as biofuel. Due to the complex structure of xylans, their biodegradation involves the action of a cocktail of xylan-degrading enzymes. In the recent years the enzymes that hydrolyze the backbone of xylans, have attracted research because of the increase in their use in the flour bread-making processes and the application for the pre-bleaching of pulps. These powerful enzymes are produced by a variety of bacteria and fungi and are indeed are fairly ubiquitous in nature where they are used in the breakdown of biomass and carbon cycling. This study will clone and characterize three xylanases from plant pathogenic fungi for possible use in the early steps of bio-base production.

285,"Development of resource efficient native or non-invasive adapted plant material is an important component in sustainable landscape implementation. Plants that require less irrigation, are adapted to local or regional soil types and climate, and require fewer inputs such as fertilizers or chemicals are needed to meet the demands of sustainable landscape requirements. Genotypes are often selected for ease of production or other criteria rather than adaptability to diverse planting sites or environments. There is a need to develop plant material that is regionally adapted to Arkansas and the surrounding environs and can be successfully grown and marketed by local producers using sustainable practices. While many regions of Arkansas claim an abundant and high quality water supply, non-point source pollution potential and future water demands in both urban and rural areas will increase. Controversies such as ongoing non-point source pollution litigation over the Illinois River watershed in Northwest Arkansas will likely increase in the future. Efficient water use in residential and urban areas throughout the United States remains a major concern (St. Hilaire et al., 2008) A major goal in sustainable landscape practices is utilizing locally available materials to reduce transportation costs and fuel expenditures. Another advantage of using locally sourced materials is the benefit to local economies derived from production, marketing, and transportation of by-products made from regionally produced products such as rice. Composted rice hulls or parboiled rice hulls (PBH) have been found to be a suitable substitute in greenhouse production of bedding plants reducing production costs by replacing sphagnum peat moss or perlite, costly materials that must be transported great distances (Evans, 2008; Gachukia and Evans, 2008). To date, while some research exists on the use of poultry litter in plant production; little research has investigated the potential of other locally available products, such as biofuel by-products, for use in the production phase of landscape plant material (Marble et al., 2008). Another goal of sustainable landscaping is the use of native or non-invasive regionally adapted plant material for both public and private planting projects. In addition to vegetation&#39;s primary role in soil stabilization, erosion control, light and sound barriers, landscaped areas can contribute to pollution remediation, carbon sequestration, and address socio-economic quality of life issues. Plant material generally used in such projects is often from a genetic source of either unknown provenance or not fully regionally adapted to Arkansas sites and climate. Effects of degraded air quality, mainly elevated ozone levels, are well documented for the more important timber species grown in the United States, but little understood in many ornamental species, both native and introduced (Broadmeadow, 2008; Peine, 1999). Guidelines are needed to select native or regionally adapted plants tolerant to ozone damage for use in urban areas, or in areas along heavily trafficked roadways, such as interstates.

286,"Nanoscale science, engineering and technology (nanotechnology) have great potential for application to the food and agricultural system. The novel physical, chemical, and biological properties of systems with structural features in the length scale for nanotechnology (1-100 nanometers) can allow the development of a new understanding of biological and physical phenomena in agricultural and food systems. In addition, nanotechnology allows scientists to measure, control, and manipulate matter at the nanoscale to change those properties and functions to the benefit of these systems. Polymeric nanoparticles developed at LSU can potentially be used as controlled delivery and release devices for bioactive components (i.e. vitamins and antioxidants) in biomedical, cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical applications. Nanoparticles can be designed to deliver the antioxidant/vitamin to the specific site of action with minimal degradation of the bioactive component during delivery. The antioxidant/vitamin is then potentially released in a controlled manner by controlling the degradation profile of the polymer, or by using  smart  polymers which interact with the cell environment (temperature, pH, enzymes, ionic strength, and other) in a predictable way. The impact of the technology is vast. Bioactive food components have been associated with the prevention and/or treatment of chronic diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis. Successful encapsulation and delivery of bioactive components (i.e. vitamin E) extracted from plant materials (i.e. rice bran) in polymeric nanoparticles can bring new revenues to the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries.

287,"Nitrate is the most commonly found pollutant in Wisconsin's ground water and may be a problem in surface waters. When present in high concentrations, nitrate in drinking water can be toxic to infants under 6 months and may contribute to human and livestock health problems. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has estimated that the water from 10% of Wisconsin wells exceeds the state public health standard for drinking water. Legumes are distinguished by their unique property of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in association with bacteria called Rhizobia. This symbiosis provides one of the major sources of available nitrogen in the biosphere and produces, every year, a quantity of available nitrogen that is equivalent to the amount synthesized by the fertilizer industry throughout the entire world. In the US alone, legumes are grown on over 80 million acres, where they fix approximately 6 million metric tons of nitrogen worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The aim of this project on DRPs in Medicago truncatula is to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to the establishment of this nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in order to avoid, in the long term, drawbacks associated with the intensive use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers, such as the greenhouse effect and water pollution by nitrates. Legumes are one of the most important families of plants worldwide. Together with cereals, legume species have been fundamental to the development of modern agricultural systems, with soybean and rice in Asia and maize and beans in the Americas. Legumes are also the third largest family of flowering plants. On a worldwide basis, this plant family contributes 33% of humankind's protein intake, while also serving as an important source of fodder and forage for animals, and of edible and industrial oils. In response to the need for a tractable genetic system in legumes, scientists have developed M. truncatula as a model species. Of particular significance, M. truncatula is amenable to efficient molecular, genetic and reverse-genetic analyses, unlike the major crop legumes. Recently, the Nitraginc Company has commercialized a mix of Nod factors and Rhizobia under the name of OptimizeTM LCO Promoter TechnologyTM for soybean, peanut and alfalfa. The effect of this product on the yield can be correlated with the stimulation of root development. We intend to develop the use of Medicago truncatula as a model plant to study biological and agronomic issues important to legumes such as biomass yield and, in the long term, to develop improved legume crops for sustainable food, feed and Biofuel production. Therefore, this proposal is relevant to meeting the national strategic Goal 4 (Improve the Nation's Nutrition and Health) and Goal 5 (Protect and Enhance the Nation's Natural Resource Base and Environment) established by the REE Mission Area and the USDA CSREES. This project is also relevant to Wisconsin Goals 5 and 6 for research on more sustainable agricultural production that provides improved environmental protection and economically viable communities but also for research on enhanced productivity for food and bio-fuel crops in a sustainable manner.

288,"Rice is an important plant commodity in Louisiana. It is planted on over 400,000 acres, with a total value of over $200 million dollars, annually. The major insect pests of rice in Louisiana are the rice water weevil, the rice stink bug, and a complex of insects that bore into rice stems. Insect pests can cause yield losses of 30% or more in Louisiana, and cost-effective insect management practices are crucial to maintaining the economic viability of rice production in Louisiana. The goal of this project is the development and implementation of cost-effective and sustainable management programs for insect pests of Louisiana rice. Currently, the management programs for insects in rice rely heavily on insecticides of the pyrethroid type. For rice water weevils, rice stink bugs, and stem borers, there is an continuing need for the evaluation of alternatives to pyrethroids that are more effective and less damaging to the environment, and evaluation of alternative insecticides is an important objective of this proposal. Moreover, alternative insecticides must be evaluated with respect to their impact on crawfish production, a major aquacultural commodity in Louisiana that is produced in intimate association with rice. For the rice water weevil, prior work has shown that certain cultural practices such as planting date and timing of flooding can have a major influence on insect populations, and further work is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of a widely used cultural practice, draining. For the rice stink bug, experiments are needed to determine whether the current threshold for use of insecticides is too low, and whether the use of the current threshold is resulting in unnecessary insecticde applications. Finally, for both stem borers and rice water weevils, there is a need to evaluate different rice varieties for resistance to these insects, and to cooperate with breeders to develop varieties of rice that possess greater levels of resistance. The proposed research should result in management programs that are more effective, less costly, less damaging to the environment and non-target crawfish, and more sustainable than current management programs. Adoption of improved management programs will result in more profitable rice and crawfish production and in less damage to the environment.

Mosquitoes are widely recognized as nuisance pests,contributing not only to a decreased quality of life, but posing a public health risk as vectors of disease pathogens such as malaria, yellow fever, encephalitis, West Nile and dog heartworm. Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes is increasing and is becoming a world-wide problem. Our studies will focus on biological agents mermethid and trichomycete associations with mosquito larvae in natural and artificial habitats. Knowledge of these symbiotic associations may provide new tools to be developed to help control mosquitoes in Arkansas. Obj.4. Arkansas cattle production results in over 27 million of dung pats per day.

290,"Commercial varieties generally lack a sufficient degree of seed dormancy to resist to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). Thus, the goal of this project is to identify seed dormancy genes from weedy or wild species and integrate the beneficial alleles into wheat and rice varieties to improve their resistance to PHS. To accomplish this goal, we have collected gene donors of seed dormancy from weedy rice (Oryza sativa) and synthetic hexaploid wheat lines derived from goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii), and also detected some quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed dormancy in weedy rice. The objectives of this project are: 1) to fine map and clone QTLs for seed dormancy in rice, 2) to identify genes for seed dormancy/PHS in wheat, and 3) to incorporate seed dormancy genes into commercial varieties to improve their PHS resistance. We will use a map-based strategy to clone the seed dormancy QTL underlying genes from weedy rice and use a QTL analysis strategy to identify the loci associated with resistance to PHS in the synthetic wheat-derived DH (double haploid) populations. As an alternative, the dormancy genes cloned from rice will also be used to probe their wheat homologs, because of the colinearity in gene order and content between rice and other grass species. The gene or QTL alleles enhancing resistance to PHS will be introduced from the weedy/wild relatives into the genetic background of cultivars to develop new germplasm. The new lines will be used as parental materials in our spring and winter wheat breeding programs to develop white grain colored varieties that are resistant to PHS by marker-assisted selection and other techniques. Thus, expected outputs from this project will include the genetic/genomic and molecular information about naturally occurring genes regulating seed dormancy in the rice and wheat crops and new lines and breeding materials with the beneficial exotic alleles imparting resistance to PHS. The knowledge gained from this research will also be valuable to develop new weed management strategies, as seed dormancy promotes persistence of weeds in agro-ecosystems.

291,"Rice is an important commodity in the southern United States and is the seventh most valuable plant commodity in Missouri. Rice is a high dollar commodity with the value of production of $495 per acre. Insects attack rice at every stage of development. In addition to agronomic pests, frequently flushed and flooded fields provide an ideal habitat for early season mosquito larvae, nuisance and public health pests for the general public. Fipronil, which was applied for control of several early season pests, also had activity against early season mosquitoes. Since the loss of fipronil and the lack of new products available, insect management is becoming more difficult. Several new seed treatments are being screened as replacements for fipronil, and these new treatments need to also be screened against mosquitoes as they also pose a risk to human health. We are also studing the the impact these insecticides have on non-target aquatic insects. Additionally, other methods to reduce damage by insect are being investigated, like seeding rates and flooding depths. Results from these studies will benefit rice farmers. Additionally, we are working on methods to reduce damage from insect pests that do not rely, or at least minimize, the use of insecticides. combat; Culicidae; Development; farmer; fipronil; Floods; Flushing; General Population; Habitats; Health; Human; improved; Insecta; Insecticides; Larva; Methods; Missouri; Plants; Production; Rice; Risk; Seasons; Seeds; Staging; United States; WorkIMPROVED METHODS TO COMBAT MOSQUITOES AND CROP PESTS IN RICE FIELDS",1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.9999868805278666,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999

The ever decreasing amount of available water for irrigation has led to the need for developing new methodologies of growing rice where only needed amount of water is applied and thus reduction of energy usage is achievable. This project will develop new technologies that will reduce water usage in rice farming by monitoring the water contents at the root zone. Automation will be applied to keep the crop in optimal condition with negligible or no yield loss. This project will also develop the technology to enable precision application of dry material from airplane.

293,"Rice is a staple food for one-fifth of the world population. Rice yield holds the key to sustaining an increasing human population and to maintaining peace and prosperity on earth. As a grain crop, reproductive development is essential for yield. Global warming has resulted in extreme environmental conditions that adversely affect agriculture. Male fertility in rice is known to be sensitive to high temperature. Therefore, understanding reproductive development and its interaction with temperature will empower us to combat environmental adversity and improve yield to sustain the human population. Small RNAs of 21-30 nucleotides in length have emerged as key players in various biological processes such as development, defense, and response to environmental stresses in both plants and animals. Plants are particularly rich in endogenous small RNAs - tens of thousands of distinct small RNA species have been uncovered in recent years with the newly developed high throughput sequencing technology. These small RNAs can be classified into four groups based on their distinct biogenesis pathways. One of the four types is called trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA). The biogenesis pathway of ta-siRNAs is conserved in Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and even moss. However, the importance of this pathway in plant development varies in different plant species. While Arabidopsis mutants of key ta-siRNA biogenesis genes have mild developmental defects, mutants of the same genes in rice and maize have severe developmental defects in both vegetative and reproductive development, such as drastic changes in leaf and floral organ shape and male sterility. Since the ta-siRNA pathway is crucial for male fertility in rice and maize, understanding how ta-siRNAs promote male reproductive development is crucial for our ability to manipulate reproductive development to achieve high yield. We plan to study the crucial role of the ta-siRNA pathway in male reproductive development in rice. We will first characterize our dcl4 and rdr6 mutants to determine the stage at which defects in anther development are first manifested. We will then profile small RNAs using high throughput sequencing technology to determine the small RNAs that are depleted or reduce in abundance in the mutants. We will then go through these small RNAs and test which ones are important for male reproductive development. In particular, the ta-siRNAs from the TAS3 locus is known to be depleted in the mutants. We will determine whether the lack of the TAS3 ta-siRNAs underlies the male reproductive defects in the mutants. We will also determine whether temperature modulates male fertility through the ta-siRNA pathway. Our work will uncover a small RNA-based regulatory mechanism underlying male reproductive development in rice, one of the major crops in the world. The knowledge gained from this work will allow us to manipulate male reproductive development to increase yield, especially when plants are grown in adverse environmental conditions that affect male fertility. The knowledge will also allow us to engineer male sterility to take advantage of hybrid vigor to increase yield.

294,"The worldwide success of maize as a high-yielding staple crop is undoubtedly tied to its C4 photosynthetic biochemistry. The C4 syndrome enables more effective use of high intensities of sunlight, high rates of carbon fixation, and superior water use efficiency. The ultimate goal of this project and cooperating groups is to identify those genes in maize that specifically encode essential steps leading to expression of C4 photosynthesis. If that were achieved it should be possible to introduce these genes, using existing molecular methods, into crop plants (i.e., wheat, rice, soybean) that possess the less efficient C3 mechanism. The challenge is to identify C4 genes in the complex and changing background of gene expression occurring in the developing leaf. One way is to overlay such patterns of gene expression on corresponding gradients in photosynthetic performance in order to correlate expression patterns with specific processes. Numerous physiological parameters are available that reflect different subprocesses that contribute to overall photosynthetic capacity. Such parameters are not trivial to measure, but require an experienced investigator and proper instrumental capabilities.

295,"As an agricultural commodity, turfgrass is not food, fiber or animal feed. It impacts the lives of millions of people in many different ways, however. The turfgrass industry has grown into a multibillion dollar business worldwide, that includes $57.9 billion in business in the U.S alone in 2000. According to the last North Carolina Turfgrass survey (1999), the total acreage of tufgrass in the state neared 2.14 million acres. Over $1.22 billion was spent to maintain these areas. Single family dwellings were by far the largest single sector of the industry, with 69% of the turf area and 60% of expenditures. Regarding the types of grasses used, tall fescue accounted for over 40% of the total area of maintained turf. Centipede and Bermuda were the next two most common types with 16% and 11%, respectively. North Carolina is located in the transition zone for cool- and warm-season grasses. While this means that we can grow both types of grasses, no one type of grass does well in all weather conditions. Cool season grasses go dormant during hot, dry months and can turn brown and even die during extremely hot and dry conditions. Warm season grasses are very drought tolerant because of their low water requirement, which makes them ideal during the summer months. However, they go dormant and turn brown during the cool days of fall and winter, and winter kill can often be a problem in the NC region. Applied plant breeding can be used to develop turfgrass cultivars that are better adapted to environmental conditions present in North Carolina. Development of cool-season grasses with increased heat and drought tolerance, and warm-season grasses with improved cold tolerance would contribute significantly to different sectors of the turfgrass industry. Genetics and applied plant breeding can also be used to improve aesthetics, performance, and disease resistance of turfgrass cultivars which, in turn, affect the efficiency of maintenance and production. The long-term goal of the program is to improve the sustainability and economic gain of the overall turfgrass industry in the state through the development of cultivars that require reduced inputs and that are capable of tolerating biotic and environmental stresses while still maintaining good quality and overall performance. Despite the fact that large amounts of genomic information have been generated for other grasses such as rice, maize, and wheat, turfgrass species have lagged far behind. Work is needed to generate such information and utilize it to relate phenotypic traits to DNA nucleotide polymorphism.

296,"Biotic (e.g. pathogens) and abiotic (e.g. drought) stresses are a major limiting factors for plant growth, development and crop productivity in South Dakota and elsewhere. However, every plant has some degree of innate tolerance or resistance to such stresses but for a successful crop we need to improve the tolerance levels of these crop plants to keep pace with the future food demands. Our hypothesis is that the stress-tolerant phenotype is a result of differential expression of unique proteins in resistant cultivars as compare to the susceptible ones to protect them during stress periods in plant's life. To develop better crop plants for our future needs, discovery of these unique proteins and understanding of the stress-tolerance mechanisms at molecular level is very important. Insights of the stress tolerance proteins-  the key players inside the cell ; will assist our plant breeders in developing better cultivars for our state needs. We can modify these key molecular players to enhance crop's stress tolerance. Discovery of such proteins that are involved in regulating biotic and abiotic stresses will help plant breeders to improve the crop plants using both conventional breeding and transgenic technologies. At present there is much progress in transformation of plants like arabidopsis, tobacco and rice but crops like wheat and soybean have lagging behind. Wheat and soybeans are still considered recalcitrant plants in terms of their genetic transformation potential. Hence, establishing efficient genetic transformation protocols are very important. As a result my research program involve studying both biotic and abiotic stresses to elucidate the mechanism of crop stress tolerance and improving stress tolerance through application of biotechnological means like genetic transformation. The molecular approach will help in understanding the stress tolerance mechanism and the biotechnology approach will be useful in crop-breeding programs.

297,"The nursery industry relies chiefly on pine and Douglas fir bark substrates for their potting mix due to several desirable characteristics including light-weight, optimal physical properties including high porosity (air and water filled pores) and disease suppression as well as reasonable cost and availability. Changes in the current market, however, threaten availability of this resource to the nursery industry. A recent survey found decline in pine bark availability across the southeast and elsewhere with associated increased cost due to less domestic forestry production, importing logs without adhering bark, increasing rate of in forest wood harvesting that leaves bark behind on the forest floor, and utilization of pine bark as a fuel source. Consequently, less than 5 percent of the forest product inventory of pine bark is available for horticultural use. Alternative substrates with desirable horticultural characteristics should be investigated to mitigate the potential impact the loss of pine bark could have on the multi-billion dollar green industry. Many studies have investigated the use of industrial and agriculture wastes as substitutes for bark including animal wastes, cotton gin, municipal leaf and sewage sludge, rice hulls, rubber tire chips, spent mushroom compost, and coconut coir dust. Many of these alternative substrate components show promise, in that, they are non-toxic to plants and can be successfully used to amend conventional substrates. However, cost, regional availability, research-based guidelines for use and a limited supply of uniform and consistent quality reduce their widespread use. The use of wood and other alternative materials to replace pine bark as a substrate is a relatively new concept in the U.S. that is beginning to receive widespread attention in the industry.

298,"The function of this proposal is research and it is a standard grant. The program priority addressed is the molecular mechanisms of communication between symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and legume plant hosts. These bacteria, rhizobia, invade the roots of legume plants, induce these plants to form a nodule to house them, and establish a symbiotic interaction. In this symbiosis, the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that the plant can utilize and the plant provides the bacteria with fixed carbon compounds produced by photosynthesis. This symbiosis is critical for agricultural productivity in crops such as alfalfa, soybean, and pea. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this symbiosis develops is required for improving the symbiotic interaction and ultimately for transferring the plant symbiotic genes to non-legume crops, such as rice and wheat. We are probing the molecular mechanisms of communication between the bacterial symbiont and its plant hosts by studying mutants of the bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti, that are unable to produce the important polysaccharide succinoglycan, and as a result are unable to invade host plants. We will focus on the role of exoK, a glycanase that is required for succinoglycan modification and specifically required for invasion of one host (Medicago truncatula) but not another (alfalfa). We will also study M. truncatula mutants to determine how the plant responds to succinoglycan to facilitate invasion. These M. truncatula mutants are being screened as part of a collaborative effort to establish genetic tools in this plant, in which our laboratory is participating.

300,"Mahnomen (wild rice) is an inherent part of being Ojibwe. It holds a central position in the lives and history of the Ojibwe people. It is not just another grain or crop, but a cultural resource of indescribable importance that is used for sustenance, ceremonial and commercial purposes. We predict that the health and productivity of wild rice is influenced by the presence and absence of disturbance. We will quantify chemical, physical and biological characteristics on eight small undisturbed lakes. We will compare the project data with existing chemical, physical and biological data from disturbed lakes with similar geomorphology to determine if there is any correlation. The end result of this study will be useful to identify the ecological requirements for wild rice production and to recognize and predict future threats. This research project will be a joint project between the Leech Lake Tribal College, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe DRM Water Quality Program, and the University of Minnesota, (Duluth) Natural Resources Research Institute. Science students from the LLTC will be trained in relevant scientific research methodologies for this environmental research and will be given opportunity to work as interns in conjunction with the LLBO DRM Water Quality Program.

Exactly how ongoing anthropogenic climate change will impact grassland ecosystems and agricultural crop productivity is a crucial question, and addressing it requires knowledge of how these important biomes were assembled in the first place. Based on plant macrofossils, co-evolved mammals, stable isotopic data, fossil soils, and phytolith (plant silica) data, the scientific community knows that grassland ecosystems dispersed at an intercontinental geographic scale sometime during the mid-Cenozoic. However, because different proxies suggest different scenarios for the emergence of grasslands both in terms of gross spatial and temporal patterns (e.g., North America vs. Africa), the details of this profound ecological transition are less certain. In most areas, only one paleo-vegetation proxy has been applied, so very little is understood about potential sampling and taphonomic biases in different records that could affect vegetation interpretation. In addition, potentially important environmental heterogeneity remains undocumented.  To resolve these issues, the PIs will use an interdisciplinary, multi-proxy approach to reconstructing the evolution of grasslands in Montana over the past ~40 Ma that can be compared directly with a paleoclimatic reconstruction based on paleosols. Specifically, the PIs will construct a long-term, high-resolution record of paleovegetation using phytoliths, pedogenic carbonates, and organic matter collected from paleosols (i.e., C isotopes to assess photosynthetic pathways). They will focus on three critical climatic transitions that are broadly believed to have significantly impacted the presence and abundance of grasses in North America, namely the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), the Oligocene-Miocene transition (OMT), and the Middle-Late Miocene transition (MLMT).

303,"Plants respond to drought and salt stress with a variety of physiological changes, including elevated accumulation of free amino acids in all tissue types. In particular, the abundance of branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) can increase 100-fold or more in Arabidopsis and other plant species. This large dynamic range in branched-chain amino acid accumulation provides a reliable and quantitative assay for investigating the regulatory networks that lead to metabolic changes in plants during osmotic stress. Knockout mutations in four out of fifteen tested transcription factors showed that they have defects in drought-induced, but not basal levels of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. Although some of these genes have been studied previously for other reasons, none of them have been associated previously with regulating branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. Further bioinformatic analysis of Arabidopsis gene expression and metabolic pathways will identify additional transcription factors that regulate branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. Assays with transcription factor knockout and overexpression lines will help to determine the contributions that these individual genes make during plant adaptation to osmotic stress. Broader Impacts. Abiotic stress, in particular drought and salt, greatly limit agricultural productivity in many parts of the world. Large increases in the biosynthesis of isoleucine, leucine, and valine, which will be studied in Arabidopsis, have also been observed in crop plants subjected to osmotic stress. Therefore, research on these Arabidopsis responses will lead to the identification of basic regulatory pathways that may aid in the development of drought and salt tolerance in crop plants. Isoleucine is also considered a limiting essential amino acid in some of the world's major food crops. Transcription factors that regulate the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway may be implemented in a targeted manner to increase isoleucine accumulation in rice, potatoes, or other agriculturally relevant plant species. This project will contribute to training a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in bioinformatics and plant metabolic biochemistry. Undergraduate summer interns participating in the project will be recruited through a well-established education and outreach program at the Boyce Thompson Institute (http://www.bti.cornell.edu/pgrp/). Additionally, the principal investigators will be involved in teaching, both in a university classroom setting and in ongoing outreach efforts to educate community members about plant biochemistry, bioinformatics, and molecular biology.

304,"Technical Summary: Small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) are crucial for quantitative characterization of hard and soft materials. However, there are no SAXS user facilities in the Houston metropolitan area, so current research programs require collaborations outside Houston and/or access to light sources at national laboratories.  The objective of this proposal is to acquire a dual SAXS/WAXS system to provide the materials research community in Houston with direct access to x-ray characterization for bulk samples, thin films, and solutions. The proposed system is ideally suited for multiple applications, a variety of sample types, and both transmission and reflection scattering modes.  Unique features include a grazing-incidence stage to characterize nanostructured thin films, a high-temperature sample stage, and a liquid-cell capillary holder. These capabilities will enhance transformative research across a wide range of federally-funded programs in nanomaterials, device physics, and biophysics that include active polymer nanocomposites, inorganic nanocomposites, inorganic nanomaterials for catalysis and energy applications, nanomagnetic devices and storage, drug and contrast agent delivery vehicles, and advanced biomembranes. The system will be installed in the Nanomaterials Characterization Facility at the University of Houston and will be available to the local materials research community in academia and industry.  Acquisition of the SAXS/WAXS system will fill an important gap in the state-of-the-art materials characterization facilities in the Houston area, and will enable continued growth of research and education of a diverse group of students in materials, nanomaterials, and biophysical sciences and engineering.  Layman Summary:  Understanding and tailoring the structure of materials is crucial for a diverse range of high-technology applications in materials, nanomaterials, and biophysical sciences and engineering.   X-ray scattering is a quantitative tool for rapid characterization of liquid solutions, thin films, or bulk materials, and the information acquired provides a deeper understanding of natural and synthetic nanoscale materials.  The Houston metropolitan area is home to numerous research-intensive universities and active industrial research, but currently there are no x-ray user facilities to support the diverse research community. The objective of this multi-institution proposal, with senior participants from the University of Houston, Texas Southern University and Rice University, is to acquire a small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering instrument system to provide the materials research community in the Houston area with direct access to x-ray characterization for a broad range of sample types. The proposed system will be installed in the Nanomaterials Characterization Facility at the University of Houston and will be available to the broad academic and industrial user base, filling an important gap in the state-of-the-art materials characterization facilities in the Houston area and enabling continued growth of research and education of a diverse group of students in materials, nanomaterials, and biophysical sciences and engineering.

306,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).This award will provide funds to renovate the research greenhouse portion of the Brown University Plant Environmental Center with new temperature control, ventilation, and lighting systems. Funds will allow replacement of the outdated environmental control and lighting systems with state-of-the-art energy efficient evaporative cooling systems, exhaust fans, horizontal air flow fans, vent motors, and lamps including computerized controls. Another key element of the renovation is to add automated energy curtains to the ceilings and walls for each of the three rooms in the greenhouse to provide insulation in the winter, shading in the summer, and the ability to maintain separate light regimes in each room. Funds will permit renovation of the experimental preparation area with better counters and sinks, storage space, and lighting to facilitate potting, tissue collection, and other activities necessary for greenhouse research projects.The research greenhouse, which is the only facility of its kind at Brown, currently supports laboratories in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and the Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry (MCB), including faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, Ph.D. students, and undergraduates. Projects use a variety of species including the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the important food plant rice, rare and threatened species, and invasive non-native plants to address fundamental questions in plant biology such as how plants interact with and adapt to their environments, how reproductive fitness is optimized, and how development is regulated. Although plant researchers at Brown have an impressive record of accomplishments, greenhouse renovations are essential for their continued success. The greenhouse infrastructure renovations will expedite plant research by removing seasonal constraints, providing ample growth facilities for large-scale experiments such as genetic screens, and increasing the range of species that can be propagated. Important long-term ramifications of the proposed renovations are stimulating new research directions and attracting new faculty and students interested in plant research.The Plant Environmental Center provides research plant growth space, classroom space, and a conservatory with a teaching plant collection to promote plant biology through research, education, and outreach. The Center draws together people interested in all aspects of plant science ranging from ethnobotany to ecology to molecular biology. The central location on campus facilitates use by students, faculty, and members of the surrounding community. The greenhouse renovations will increase the visibility of plant research at Brown across the wide audience drawn to the Plant Environmental Center. A key broader impact will be to increase recruitment of undergraduates into plant research projects, which is a top priority in our participating laboratories. Greenhouse renovations will also aid in their outreach efforts such as visits from local K-12 classes and development of plant science curricular modules for high school students.

307,"Between the winter of 2006 and the summer of 2008 prices of the world's four most importat staple food commodities (rice, wheat, corn and soybeans) more than tripled. These four staple crops comprise about 75% of the world's caloric base. This project develops a new methodology to use detailed data about weather and agricultural output to examine how climate change affects food commodity prices and particularly commodity price variability. The project begins with using econometric techniques and detailed data on weather and agricultural output. The data are used to estimate and test a statistical model of a non-linear relationship between weather and output; the results of that model are predictions about the yield variability of the four major staple crops in all major global production regions. The next step uses existing climate change projections to develop sensible predictions for future specific changes in weather patterns, including changes in the mean/average outcome, changes in the variability of climate, and correlation between the different production regions. The results of the first two steps are then combined to give a prediction of how climate change will change the distribution of agricultural yields. The next step is to consider how past weather shocks have affected supply and demand for these staple crops. This information is used to estimate a structural model of supply and demand for each of the four staple crops. Combining this market model with the predicted changes in the distribution of agricultural yields allows the PIs to make predictions about how future climate change will affect commodity prices. The models will also be used to examine the likely effects of changes in government policy and changes in how farmers and commodity traders store crops from year to year. The specifics of the research plan includeA: Linking weather and yield variability.  The PIs extend their earlier work to examine yield variablility of the four major staple crops throughout the world.B: Climate change projections.  The PIs summarize the predictions of various General Circulation Models on (i) mean outcomes; (ii) changes in variability, and (iii) correlation between production regions.  Each one of these three changes in weather patterns would directly influence the distribution of yields.C: Predict yield distributionsCombining parts A and B gives revised yield distributions under climate change.  The non linear temperature-yield relationship from part A implies that even a mean increase in temperatures with constant variance could impact yield variability, as would a change in weather variability.  Finally, if weather becomes more (or less) correlated or if the geography of agricultural production becomes more (or less) concentrated, idiosyncratic productions shocks will no longer average out and total world production could become more (or less) variable.D: Yield variability and commodity prices.Using weather-induced yield shocks as instruments allows the researchers to estimate supply and demand elasticities for the four staple crops.  While randome yield shocks have previously been used to estimate demand elasticities, lagged yield shocks can also be used to identify supply elasticities, as past production shocks are linked to the current period's effort through storage.  With the elasticity estimates the researchers can translate their yield distribution into a distribution of commodity prices.E: Simulate the effects of competitive storage and government policies.  Farmers and commodity traders are likely to resond to changes in production and price variability by adjusting inventory holdings.  Inventories help to attenuate price variability in the face of year-t0-year productions variability.  Inventory adjustments will therefore partly buffer changes in production variability, as could continued expansion of irrigated agriculuture.  On the other hand, export restrictions and other government policies might exaggerate price variability.This interdisciplinary project brings economists, agronomists, and environmental scientists together.

309,This project will develop a new magnetic field model aimed for use during magnetospheric substorms.  The model will be derived from a series of computer experiments based on the equilibrium version of the Rice Convection Model (RCM-E). The project will construct a cross-tail current module for the substorm growth phase and a substorm current-wedge module for the expansion.  The project will also use the comprehensive set of RCM-E simulations as a large database to systematically investigate the adiabatic convection of the plasma during substorm growth phase and the transport of the depleted flux tubes in the expansion phase.The methodology to be used is to generate a large number of RCM-E simulations with systematically varied inputs.  This will make it possible to determine how different changes in the boundary conditions and the initial condition affect the magnetic field configuration in the inner magnetosphere.  This approach will also make it possible to establish the cause-and-effect relationships between different physical processes and consequences. The new model will be made available to the space physics community where it can be used to specify the magnetic field configuration for a variety of substorm conditions.  The project will benefit several of the Focus Groups that are part of the Geospace Environment Modeling program.  The model is expected to be of utility in understanding and improving space weather forecasts as well.

310,"This PIRE renewal award supports the expansion of a unique interdisciplinary U.S.-Japan research and education partnership focused on terahertz (THz) dynamics in nanostructures.  The 0.1 to 10 THz frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum is where electrical transport and optical transitions merge, thus offering exciting opportunities to study a variety of novel physical phenomena.  By combining THz technology and nanotechnology, we can advance our understanding of THz physics while improving and developing THz devices.  Nanotechnology is the study of nanostructures (between 1 to 100 nanometers long) and how they can be controlled, fabricated, or manipulated.  New discoveries provide insight into the possibilities for novel electronic, photonic, mechanical, and magnetic devices that have huge potential for future technological applications including medicine, computation, and communications.This PIRE project will (a) advance our quantitative understanding of THz dynamics in nanostructures, (b) fabricate novel nanostructures for THz study and applications, (c) advance cutting-edge experimental techniques in THz spectroscopy and imaging, and (d) provide new knowledge useful for developing novel THz devices.  The projects explore THz dynamics in carbon nanomaterials, namely, nanotubes and graphene.The U.S. and Japan are global leaders in both THz research and nanotechnology, and stimulating cooperation is critical to further advance THz science and develop commercial products from new ideas in the lab.  However, obstacles exist for international collaboration - primarily linguistic and cultural barriers - and this PIRE project aims to continue breaking down these barriers.  The project will also leverage large investments by both countries to achieve long-term scientific and societal impact by providing future generations of researchers with a better understanding of both the culture and the state-of-the-art technology in each country.The strong educational portfolio of this project focuses on cultivating interest in nanotechnology among young U.S. undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, and encouraging such students to pursue graduate study and academic research in the physical sciences.  This renewed funding will expand and strengthen the award-winning international research experience program for undergraduates called the NanoJapan Program.  Recognized as a model for international education programs for science and engineering students, this program will provide U.S. undergraduates with structured research opportunities in Japanese university laboratories with Japanese mentors.  This program includes a three-week orientation program with language and culture training as well as extensive use of information technologies as learning and community-building tools.  U.S. graduate students, early career scientists, researchers and alumni will benefit from direct involvement in the PIRE research as well as from related follow-on educational projects at home institutions and in local communities.  Other programs such as undergraduate and graduate research assistantships and the NanoAsia Graduate International Research Experience (IRE) are additional venues for international collaboration for U.S. students.  The original PIRE had particular success with recruitment of females and African-American students; these recruitment efforts will continue and will be expanded to include first-generation college-attending students.  This broad portfolio of PIRE educational activities should produce a diverse cadre of students with rich skill sets that span nanoscience specialties, international cultural awareness, and the intersection of culture, language, science, and technology.Institutional impacts of this award include strengthening Rice University's leadership position in international research and education in THz science, materials science, and nanoscience.  It places Rice at the hub of an exciting domestic and international collaborative network of researchers and educators, while leveraging the University of Tulsa's exceptional strength in international education, especially its expertise in developing international education programs for science and engineering students.  An Introduction to Nanotechnology & Nanoscience Online Seminar will be developed within this PIRE and will be webcast live and archived online, enabling live or asynchronous participation of all U.S. and Japanese participants, thus enhancing the international curriculum at all institutions.  In addition, the project will further strengthen and internationalize connections within and among campuses established through the original PIRE award, including those with international offices, IT units, and curriculum and assessment specialists.

311,"A clinical data warehouse (CDW) is a repository that aggregates medical patient data from many different sources: billing records, electronic medical records including structured data (e.g., codes for diagnoses, procedures, vital signs, etc.), semi-structured reports and free-text dictations. A key benefit of maintaining a CDW lies in its ability to provide the raw data that are needed for large-scale study of real-world health care -- for example, finding a previously unknown association between a pain killer (e.g., Vioxx) and heart disease. Unfortunately, CDWs are riddled with systematic errors that make it difficult to answer even the simplest questions (such as  What fraction of female outpatients have breast cancer? ) with any accuracy.This project focuses on statistical models and learning algorithms for quantifying and correcting errors in CDW records. For example, the project is developing semi-supervised learning methods that use the structured data present in electronic medical records (patient age, weight, medications, billing codes, etc.) in order to quantify the likelihood of error that is associated with the diagnosis codes present in the record (for example, being able to state  There is a 0.2 probability that the correct code was migraine instead of the listed headache ). The project will also develop methods that attempt to control for confounding variables present in the records, in order to remove systematic biases from the data.These models and learning algorithms will allow CDW users to manage and monitor the uncertainty and error in the data.  This in turn will allow fundamentally new types of analysis to be undertaken, which will result in the discovery of actionable medical knowledge that saves both lives and money.  To make the models and algorithms accessible to medical professionals who may lack computational or statistical background, they will be added to an open-source release of the widely-used I2B2 CDW software.The project is a collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rice University and the School of Biomedical informatics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

Specifically, the cognitive radios, rather than sweeping a set of channels sequentially, will sense linear combinations of the powers of multiple channels and report them to the fusion center, where the occupied channels are recovered using compressive sensing algorithms. Missing and erroneous reports can be exactly recovered by matrix completion since the matrix of all reports has a low-rank. Prior knowledge of channel gains is not required.

316,"Name: Xing-You GuProposal number: IOS-1021382Title of the proposal: Evolutionary and developmental mechanisms of embryo dormancy in rice Domestication of cereal crops from wild relatives has reduced seed dormancy, which can be imposed by inherent constraints within the embryo (embryo dormancy) or by restrictive tissues covering the embryo (coat-imposed dormancy). A small region of the genome designated as qSD12 has been isolated from weedy rice and is known to contain one or more genes that control embryo dormancy. Map-based cloning has identified two candidate genes for qSD12. The project aims to determine the function, origin, differentiation, and distribution of the candidates and to identify qSD12 downstream gene networks that regulate the development of embryo dormancy in the rice model system. Isogenic lines for the candidate genes and several approaches, such as complementation, haplotype, and transcriptomic analyses, will be used to achieve these objectives. The project is expected to assign one or two of the candidate genes to the function of embryo dormancy, reveal whether the dormancy gene(s) differentiated before or after the rice domestication, whether cultivated rice species and subspecies originated from different functional mutations, and provide direct knowledge of molecular and physiological pathways through which the naturally occurring gene regulates embryo dormancy. The broader impacts of the project include: 1) practical training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students and teachers in biology and agricultural programs; and 2) interdisciplinary collaborations to use the dormancy gene for breeding varieties resistant to pre-harvest sprouting and to test the hypothesis that orthologous genes regulate dormancy and germination in other grasses.

319,"This award is an outcome of the NSF 09-524 program solicitation  George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research (NEESR)  competition and includes the Georgia Institute of Technology (lead institution), Howard University (subaward), and Rice University (subaward). The project will utilize the NEES mobile shakers operated by the University of California, Los Angeles.The project team will evaluate the efficacy of a new class of innovative systems with recentering and/or high damping capabilities, and develop a framework for their design and implementation to retrofit reinforced concrete (RC) buildings to improve seismic performance. The goal is to validate, via innovative large scale field testing, a new class of retrofits for RC buildings. Five retrofit measures will be investigated, consisting of novel bracing systems, beam-column connection elements, or columns wraps. Common advantageous characteristics of the systems include the ease of application (requiring little-to-no heavy machinery), scalability and adaptability, passive nature, and need for little-to-no maintenance through the life-cycle. Furthermore, these systems aim to provide improved seismic performance in terms of minimal damage, enhanced post-event functionality, and improved cost-benefit compared to traditional retrofit approaches. The use of advanced materials in innovative systems will result in improved seismic retrofits for RC buildings that may find more widespread adoption due to their efficient design, minimal maintenance or disruption for installation, and enhanced cost-effectiveness.   The research includes a series of unique multi-scale experiments, coupled with detailed finite element simulations, fragility analyses, and cost-benefit studies. Research, education, and outreach plans include the following key components:  (1) first of its kind full-scale system-level validation of innovative retrofit systems (many based on shape memory alloys) using the NEES mobile shakers; (2) code-based designs of retrofit measures, in collaboration with experienced design professionals; (3) damage detection approaches using wireless sensors that project detailed information on the condition of the innovative retrofits, and the system response; (4) detailed fragility analyses, or vulnerability models, of buildings with and without retrofit; (5) cost-benefit and life-cycle cost analyses to inform decision-makers on optimal building retrofits; (6) international cooperation on reduced-scale system-level tests with Sherbrooke University in Canada, and medium-scale testing at National Taiwan University, and Hongik University (Korea); (7) a comprehensive outreach and education program impacting all levels (K-12, college, and industry); and (8) workshops focused on technology transfer with industry leaders.Intellectual Merit:  This research provides the first large-scale validation of high performance systems based on a series of multi-scale component and full-scale system-level field tests. Detailed analytical modeling and fragility analyses will be performed to assess the impact of various innovative retrofits on reducing the seismic vulnerability of RC buildings. A framework will be established, ranging from smart sensing and structural damage state estimation, to fragility modeling, performance assessment, and cost-benefit studies of retrofitted RC buildings. The validation of the new systems are expected to provide a marked advance in performance (seismic and life-cycle) through innovative design, material usage, and implementation to transform current approaches for seismic retrofit of buildings.Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the proposed research, education, and outreach program are four-fold. First, the novel multi-scale testing, coupled with detailed analysis, will provide the first known system-level validation of such high performance systems. Second, the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and minimal disruption caused by retrofits proposed can result in superior retrofit approaches with broad application to improve building performance nationwide. Third, the collaboration with industry partners and field testing of retrofits in real structures will address realistic challenges of implementation and streamline transfer to practice. A series of workshops will bring together academics, researchers, and industry to advance the transfer of innovative systems for seismic building retrofit.  Fourth, a multi-faceted education program addresses the need to improve high school science and engineering curriculum, while addressing the lack of underrepresented students pursuing degrees in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) arena.Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.

320,"AbstractAward:  DMS-1007383Principal Investigator:  Michael WolfThe principal investigator will continue his research in two-dimensional geometric variational problems. In particular, he proposes projects in several areas of classical minimal surface theory, all concerned with using Teichmuller theory to prove existence or uniqueness or properties of minimal surfaces in Euclidean three-space. He proposes research in two areas of Teichmuller theory: Weil-Petersson geometry and grafting.  Both bring a Riemannian perspective to problems often studied via other methods. In addition, he proposes studying problems arising in convex projective structures on surfaces as well as work on degenerating harmonic quasi-isometries of the hyperbolic plane. These last are informed by his earlier work on high energy harmonic maps. In recent years, the PI has focused considerable attention upon education at all levels. He supervises graduate students; he coordinates a VIGRE program at Rice University encompassing roughly a dozen small research groups in the mathematical sciences whose vertical organization ranges from the undergraduate stratum through the graduate and postdoctoral level to the permanent faculty; he participates in one of these groups himself, he lectures to teachers and acts as a scientific advisor to programs to enhance the mathematical understanding of K-12 teachers.  He serves the broader mathematical community by serving on the editorial board of three journals, through organizing large and small conferences and through lectures to general audiences. He is quite involved with undergraduate advising. The PI will continue with all of these activities.One of the guiding principles of science is that Nature is efficient: when we encounter natural phenomenon, we expect that the shapes we find will use the least material for their construction, or be the thinnest that can be made with a material or will span the largest region possible, or some other sort of optimization.  At the same time, a common geometric component of many natural systems is a two-dimensional surface, usually configured in some curved manner.  These surfaces occur at all scales, from the boundary of a protein to the surface of the brain to the frontier of the magnetosphere.  In this project, we investigate problems that relate aspects of the shapes of surfaces to quantities they might optimize, and also how deforming one feature of the shape of a surface affects other qualities of that surface. abstracting; Affect; Area; Attention; Award; Brain; Communities; editorial; Education; Faculty; frontier; graduate student; Journals; lectures; Maps; Methods; Nature; Principal Investigator; programs; Property; Proteins; Research; Rice; Science; Shapes; Sorting - Cell Movement; Structure; Surface; symposium; System; teacher; theories; Time; two-dimensional; Universities; Wolves; WorkTEICHMULLER THEORY AND LOW-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRIC VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
321,"The NSF Archaeology Program High Risk Exploratory Research competition will permit Dr. Anne Underhill (Field Museum) and her colleagues at Shandong University, China, to test 3-5 potential sites in the Rizhao area of southeastern Shandong province for excavation.  Through their systematic, regional survey for over a decade, Dr. Underhill and her Sino-American team located hundreds of settlements from the Longshan period, c. 2600-1900 B.C.. They identified a clear hierarchy with respect to the size of settlements and hypothesized that the site of Liangchengzhen, long known for its finely made pottery vessels and jade objects in an area over 100 hectares in size, was a regional center.  Mainly utilitarian pottery vessels and stone tools were found at the smaller settlements judged to be subsidiary to the political center at Liangchengzhen.  The team then excavated at Liangchengzhen from 1999-2001.  What remains unclear however is the nature of the interactions between people living in the regional center and those in the smaller, outlying communities.  By excavating a smaller settlement contemporary to and located near Liangchengzhen, the team aims to investigate the nature of social, economic, political, and ritual relations in the late prehistoric, Liangchengzhen polity.  The team will evaluate hypotheses about the emergence of urbanism, the nature of economic control (by means such as craft production and exchange) of smaller settlements by elites at Liangchengzhen, and mechanisms such as public rituals involving veneration of ancestors for social integration in the region.  Achieving this goal will require extensive testing of the buried Longshan deposits at the smaller settlement sites.  The team will work with local experts in probing and assessment of exposed profiles to identify buried residential areas dating to the Early and Middle phases of the Longshan period as at Liangchengzhen.  The ideal site to be chosen for eventual excavation will have evidence for houses and residential debris (production and consumption of pottery and stone objects, rice and other grains, domesticated animals, and ritual remains such as unusually large pits containing pots with residues for fermented beverages).  Since the sites to be tested were discovered by the team a decade ago, another task will be to assess the impact of modern farming and other activities on the buried deposits.  The field season also will be devoted to an initial study of resource distribution (such as clays) and changes to the regional landscape during and after the Longshan period.  This NSF funded project will enable the continuation of one of the longest Sino-foreign collaborative fieldwork, training, and publication programs.  The short testing phase will provide opportunities for archaeology students from the United States and Shandong University.  The opportunity to adequately assess the deposits at the candidate sites for their potential to yield the kinds of artifacts necessary to test the nature of interactions between settlements is essential for the success of the future excavation.  Few regional projects in China, home to one of the world's earliest civilizations, have involved studies of the range of possible hierarchical and horizontal relations between settlements and how polities developed prior to the establishment of the first literate dynasties.

322,"The Principal Investigator of the project is Tim D. Cochran of William Marsh Rice University in Houston Texas. The broad goal of the project is to find applications of methods of noncommutative algebra to problems in topology, group theory and number theory. Over the last 12 years the PI and collaborators have developed a vast theory of so-called higher-order Alexander modules, linking forms and signatures. These can be associated to knots, links, 3-manifolds, spaces, groups or even surface homeomorphisms.  The project will apply these techniques to important open problems in topology and group theory. Specific goals are: to find  structure in the smooth knot and link concordance groups, in particular to find structure in the subgroup of smooth concordance classes of topologically slice knots; to prove primary decomposition theorems for terms of the COT filtration of the knot concordance group; to find similar structures and complexity in the homology cobordism classes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds; to find a refinement of Heegaard Floer Knot Homology that better reflects the noncommutativity of the fundamental group of the knot exterior; to use  similar techniques to find new elements of homology for subgroups of mapping class groups;  to continue to find further relationships between homology equivalence and fundamental group and  apply these results to the virtual betti number problem in 3-manifolds. The PI also will extend, to the category of pro-p groups, the foundational results of Stallings, Dwyer, and Cochran-Harvey relating group homology to  derived and lower central series.This project studies mathematical aspects of the shape, or topology, of 3-dimensional objects. Shape is crucial to  the design of antiviral drugs, the study of networks, search algorithms, satellite recognition of objects, the medical imaging and modeling of human organs and in the function of cellular DNA. Even though all common objects are 3-dimensional in nature, such shapes can be quite complicated. For example, the shape of a large molecule, such as a protein is quite complex, and mostly unknown, despite the fact that such knowledge is vital to the creation of antiviral drugs. How can an imaging device distinguish a tank from a house given only partial data? How can one usefully quantify the shape of a human brain given that all brains are different? The scientific study of shape requires mathematical ideas that can accurately quantify the complex non-linear behavior of such objects. Noncommutative algebra, such as in matrices where AB is not necessarily equal to BA, is necessary to model simple real-life situations. This project will develop new tools in noncommutative mathematics and apply these to specific problems concerning the shape of 3-dimensional objects. 3-Dimensional; Algorithms; Antiviral Agents; Behavior; Brain; Categories; Cell physiology; Complex; Data; design; DNA; Elements; Filtration; Goals; Housing; Human; Imaging Device; Knowledge; Life; Link; Maps; Mathematics; Medical Imaging; Methods; Modeling; Nature; object recognition; Organ; Principal Investigator; Proteins; Rice; Series; Shapes; Slice; Structure; Subgroup; Surface; Techniques; Texas; theories; tool; Universities; virtualNONCOMMUTATIVE ALGEBRAIC INVARIANTS IN TOPOLOGY",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,2.230847361962489e-06,1e-06

327,"The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research project of Prof. James Rice of South Dakota State University.  Prof. Rice and his students will investigate the role of nanoparticles in the formation of self assembled Natural Organic Matter (NOM). They will apply scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and isotopically-labeled lipids and amphiphiles as probes in combination with solid-state NMR spectroscopy, small-angle neutron scattering, and neutron spin-echo spectrometry to provide molecular level understanding of the self assembly process leading to achieve this goal. The project has the potential to increase our molecular level understanding of mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of organic carbon in soils and thus the global carbon cycle. As a practical outcome, the ability to control NOM self-assembly could lead to the development of sequestration mechanisms and strategies to increase its residence time in the soil. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to students and postdoctoral fellows in a highly interdisciplinary research area of great environmental importance.

328,"AbstractProposal Number:  EPS - 1006743Proposal Title:  Partnerships for Competitiveness: Cyber-Enabling Primarily Undergraduate InstitutionsInstitution:   South Dakota State UniversityProject Director:  James A. RiceThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).The Research, Education and Economic Development (REED) network initiative provides South Dakota's portion of the Northern Tier networking project and connects SD's public, private and tribal campuses, the US Geological Survey's Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Data Center, the Sanford Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (SUSEL), and the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) to each other and the national research grid.This project proposes an upgrade to the cyberinfrastructure (CI) for four South Dakota institutions: Augustana College (AC), Sinte Gleska University (SGU), Oglala Lakota College (OLC), and Sisseton Wahpeton College (SWC). The upgrades would provide these institutions with access to cyberinfrastructure, educational and research enhancements on their respective campuses. These four institutions are predominantly undergraduate institutions and three (OLC, SGU, SWC) are tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). Augustana College is a small institution with a rich history of attracting and retaining first-generation college students. The investment in these institutions should have a pronounced impact on the research, education and culture of these institutions. Motivated by the very large distances between these South Dakota campuses, and even the large distances within an individual campus, this CI investment should enable state-wide course sharing, videoconferencing, and easier access to the research and educational resources of the state universities. It should also enhance collaborations, outreach capacity and provide greater access to people, knowledge and scientific research and education from across the globe.  Intellectual Merit The South Dakota (SD) RII C2 investment should provide access to undergraduate research experiences to students who currently have limited access to independent research opportunities on their respective campuses. It is proposed that these students participate in original research, spanning a broad range of research areas in collaboration with major research institutions in South Dakota and throughout the world. The ability to communicate, collaborate and interact with scientists across the state, the nation and the world, will enable these faculty and students to explore subjects heretofore not possible. New learning activities and the modes of sharing these activities across the proposed digital connection should serve to establish novel concepts and best practices for building collaborative research and educational activities. Equally important are the new ideas these colleges bring to the research communities, such as discoveries arising from studies of the natural environment and their relationship to the culture of these primarily Native American communities.Broader Impact The four institutions primarily impacted in this project are representative of the rich diversity of the citizens of South Dakota. The ability to fully participate in SD's EPSCoR programs should broaden the institutional diversity of the South Dakota EPSCoR program. The Tribal College students come from a tribal heritage that represents a very small fraction of the students at major research institutions. To encourage these students to consider STEM careers, access to the larger scientific community is needed for collaborative research investigations and to realize confidence in their own talent and ability to contribute. From these experiences, a greater degree of confidence and the validation of their capabilities should be realized. The intent is to provide the opportunity for students to develop the capability, interest, and enthusiasm to invest their lives in a STEM career path. abstracting; American; Area; Award; career; Collaborations; college; Communities; Data; digital; Economic Development; Education; Educational Activities; Engineering; Environment; experience; Faculty; Funding; Generations; Individual; Institution; interest; Investigation; Investments; Knowledge; Laboratories; Laws; Learning; Native Americans; novel; outreach; programs; Recording of previous events; Recovery; Research; Resources; Rice; Science; Scientist; South Dakota; Students; Surveys; Talents; Teton Sioux Indian; tribal college; Universities; university student; Validation; Videoconferences; VideoconferencingPARTNERSHIPS FOR COMPETITIVENESS: CYBER-ENABLING PRIMARILY UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTIONS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
329,"PI: Daniel Zilberman (University of California, Berkeley) Co-PI: Robert Fischer (University of California, Berkeley) Senior personnel: Pamela C. Ronald (University of California, Davis), Takashi Okamoto (Tokyo Metropolitan University) Plant seeds consist of embryos supported by a nutritive tissue called endosperm. In the cereal crops, such as rice, the endosperm occupies the bulk of the seed and serves as a major source of food for humans and livestock. Full understanding of how seeds develop is important to future crop improvement, and there is now evidence that direct genomic changes help to regulate seed development. In particular, genetic and molecular studies, primarily in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, show that endosperm development is regulated by methylation, in which methyl groups are added to DNA and associated proteins. This type of direct change to the DNA is a form of epigenetic regulation and it can influence the size and quality of the seed, in part by regulating gene expression that is specific to a parental genome, known as genomic imprinting. Genome-wide changes in endosperm DNA methylation also interface with small RNA pathways and influence control of transposable elements, segments of DNA that move throughout the genome. In rice, as in most other important crops, the epigenetic landscape of gametes and seeds are unknown. To understand epigenetic regulation of rice seed development, this project will analyze DNA methylation, identify modifications to the DNA-associated proteins, called histones, and characterize small RNAs in rice seed tissues. This project will quantify gene expression, identify imprinted genes, and will use computational tools to identify rice pathways regulated by genomic imprinting. Comparisons of imprinted genes between rice and Arabidopsis will help clarify how genomic imprinting has evolved in flowering plants. Nearly half of the world food supply is provided by the proteins, carbohydrates and nutrients stored in properly developed endosperm. Imprinted genes specifically influence seed yield by controlling resource allocation to the endosperm. The outcomes from this project will enable new technologies that increase crop yield to feed a growing population, thereby directly addressing the problem of hunger in our society. The project will attract new students to science by incorporating undergraduate students into the research program. In particular, students will be recruited from the Berkeley Biology Scholars Program, established to promote the success of undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in the biological sciences. All genomic data will be made available to the public through the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and a dedicated web site that will be developed for this project.

330,"1034421RobertThis project involves the study of several challenging sub-projects related to the equilibrium and transport properties of confined colloid-polymer mixtures (monolayers and channels). First, the PI will investigate experimentally by the Langmuir-Blodgett method the phase behavior of monolayers of colloid/polymer mixtures. The nanostructures of these monolayers will be determined by atomic force microscopy and Brewster angle microscopy. Secondly, a theoretical model will be developed based on that of McMillan to understand the phase transitions of these systems. Lastly, the PI will determine by florescence light microscopy the diffusion of polymer in channels as well as the diffusion of a pair of polymers in colloidal suspensions confined to narrow channels. Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity In the investigations of monolayers of colloid-polymer mixtures, a theory will be developed in order to describe the structure of the possible liquid-crystalline ordering of the polymers and the evidence garnered from the proposed experiments will be used to test the theoretical model.  The theory will be modified if it fails to agree with the experiments, and the experimental parameters will be implemented in our theory. The details of experimental study of dynamics of polymer in channels will be investigated. The measurement resolution and uncertainty quantification are those of enhanced video fluorescent microscopy. The connection between theory and experiment for one-dimensional polymer diffusion will be studied. The theory of polymer diffusion in the presence of colloids in one-dimensional channels was developed in our previous NSF grant, and the coefficient of diffusivity was expressed in terms of the molecular parameters of the polymer, the size of the colloids, and the viscosity of the solvent.  Since these quantities are directly measurable, our experiments will be directly connected to theory.The problems that will be studied are challenging fundamental ones which require expertise in thermodynamics, statistical thermodynamics, theoretical and experimental physical chemistry and condensed matter physics. In particular, the experimental investigations of Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers of colloid-polymer mixtures will determine their phase transitions and shed light on unsolved problems related to depletion effects in confined geometries.  The proposed activity is fundamental in nature, but it is inspired by and is beneficial to the numerous technological applications which involve self-assemblies of nano-particles and mixtures of colloids and polymers which are described in the proposal. These diverse fields of expertise required make it an interdisciplinary study not usually carried out by a single PI. Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity In addition to the PI's graduate students, several of which have become professors at first-rate universities, a large number of undergraduate students will take part in the proposed activity, and several will make presentations at national and regional scientific meetings and become coauthors of publications, as has been the case under the previous NSF grant. Such integration and encouragement proves very effective in making undergraduate students of the PI, including many women, decide to go to graduate school in chemical engineering and in allied disciplines. The top undergraduate sophomore student at Rice University, a woman, has already expressed her interest in joining the group.  The PI will continue to be involved in several outreach programs of Rice University, in which he discusses this proposed activity in understandable terms with middle and high school teachers and students, in predominantly African-American and Hispanic public schools of Houston, those most largely underrepresented in academia. The PI will pursue his efforts to convince them of the intimate bond between scientific and societal progress. The PI will also maintain the summer visits to his laboratory in which, during one week, several middle school students in the summer take part in research.

331,"In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, James Tour, Stephan Link and Angel Marti of the William Marsh Rice University will develop and study molecules that exhibit controlled motion on a surface,  nanocars .  The approach is to synthesize  nanocars  that incorporate fluorescent moieties within their frameworks and to continue expanding the repertoire of molecular parts that can be used to build these molecules.  The PIs will also incorporate molecular entities into the  nanocars  that exhibit photon driven rotation and may acts as a propulsion mechanism for the molecules.  Finally, the PIs will develop optical microscopy methods for tracking and characterizing the translation motion of the individual molecules and to utilize these methods to measure quantities such as collision frequencies and diffusion coefficients.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  Additionally, the PIs plan to develop informal science learning approaches aimed at middle school students.  Major principles in book chapters from middle school science curricula will be translated into bullet points, developed into dance songs (with professional help) and then added to open source Step Mania and Jamming software packages.  This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about controlling individual molecular movement across a surface.  Ultimately, such work could lead to the development of molecular machines that could control chemical transport and fabrication at ultrasmall dimensions.

332,"The rice receptor-like kinase, XA21, is a key recognition determinant in the innate immune response, a pathogen defense pathway widely conserved between plants and animals. Few proteins that transduce the rice innate immune response have been characterized. For this reason the isolation of a protein from an in vivo XA21 complex, called BiP (luminal binding protein, also called glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78)), is particularly important. BiP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-located member of the family of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 chaperones. In BiP3-overexpressing rice plants, XA21-mediated resistance is compromised and XA21 stability is significantly decreased. These results indicate that BiP3 regulates XA21 protein stability and processing and that this regulation is critical for resistance. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms of innate immunity, determine the role of BiP in these signaling pathways, and use this information to develop new strategies for disease control in plants and animals. The project will use biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches to determine how the ER chaperone BiP affects XA21-mediated signaling. Results from these studies will lead to major advances in understanding biogenesis and processing of plant and animal sensors of pathogen-derived molecules. Because XA21 is closely related to sensors controlling innate immunity in other plants and animals, the expected results will have a broad impact on understanding and controlling diseases of cereals and humans. The results will have relevance to other plant-microbe interactions and will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding of the mechanisms of innate immunity. Postdoctoral and graduate students will receive training in bacterial genetics, biochemistry, and plant pathology. Educational outreach includes a month-long science and art program to be presented in a local elementary school.

333,"PI: Susan R. McCouch (Cornell University)CoPI(s):  Jason Mezey (Cornell University), Georgia C. Eizenga and Anna M. McClung (University of Arkansas/USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center)Key Collaborator(s): Stefan Einarson (Cornell University) and Lewis H. Ziska (USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center)This project will establish a joint forward-reverse genetics platform to facilitate the utilization of wild and exotic genetic materials in plant improvement and to accelerate the pace of discovery of genes and gene networks underlying transgressive variation in rice. Transgressive variation occurs in crosses between genetically divergent parents where offspring outperform the better parent. The nature of transgressive variation is that an individual locus' effect is dependent on other loci in the genetic background. Thus, the genetic dissection of transgressive variation necessitates modeling explicit gene interactions.  Over the course of this project, models of genotype by genotype interaction(s) will be developed and validated, information that is key to manipulating non-additive genetic variation that can rapidly propel significant improvements in plant yield, adaptation and quality.  In addition, this project will create a comprehensive genomics platform using wild and exotic rice germplasm to accelerate the pace of discovery of genes and gene networks underlying transgressive variation in rice for plant improvement.  Specific objectives are to (1) re-sequence 30 diverse Oryza rufipogon accessions for the development of a 600K SNP chip for rice; (2) phenotype an expanded panel of wild and exotic rice germplasm for resistance to selected biotic and abiotic stresses; (3) create genetic materials for use in association mapping analyses and to rapidly translate discoveries into plant breeding applications; and, (4) develop integrated analysis techniques aimed at detecting non-additive genetic architecture associated with transgressive variation.This project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the breadth and depth of genotypic and phenotypic variation within the rice gene pool and to empower the rice community to efficiently translate this knowledge into practical applications in plant improvement. Educational outreach activities will provide diverse opportunities for interdisciplinary, hands-on learning for high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral fellows with emphasis on groups that are currently under-represented in science.  The project will also continue and expand the 3-week Rice:Research to Production field-course in collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute (the Philippines).  All of the data, germplasm and genomic resources developed on this project will be publicly available through project websites (www.ricediversity.org and www.ricesnp.org), the Gramene database (www.gramene.org), the International Rice Germplasm Center (IRGC), and the Genetic Stocks Center Oryza (GSOR) (www.gsor.gov).

Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) feeds more people than any other crop.  As the rice-dependent population is expected to double in about 25 years, breeders are faced with the enormous task of doubling rice yields with less land, water, and fertilizers, and on poorer soils.  It is therefore critical that the scientific community unites to provide the tools and biological/evolutionary insights required to meet future needs.  The project's long-term goal is to exploit 15 million years of evolutionary diversification and adaptation that have been locked in the genomes of wild and domesticated Oryza species, to both improve cultivated rice and address fundamental questions in evolutionary and comparative genomics. To accomplish this goal the project will first generate a set of publicly available genomics resources for the genus Oryza including:  i) physical maps for three wild relatives of cultivated rice and the closely related outgoup species Leersia perrieri;  ii) complete sequences for the short arms of chromosome 3 of these species;  iii) complete reference genome sequences for O. barthii (the wild progenitor of West African cultivated rice), and O. punctata (a wild species that will serve as the evolutionary outgroup the eight AA genome species--the species group containing O. sativa);  iv) gene and small RNA expression data sets for 11 Oryza species and L. perrieri;  and v) DNA polymorphism data sets across the AA genome phylogeny.  The project will integrate these new resources with 5 to 8 forthcoming new Oryza reference genome sequences to create the most comprehensive within-genus comparative genomics platform for any plant system. The project will interrogate this comparative genomics platform to discover key evolutionary events and characterize the forces that led to the formation of 24 Oryza species with 10 different genome types.  Specific research areas that will be addressed include: analyses of structural variation, phylogenomics, population genomics, genome evolution and the origin of new genes, and the role of transposable elements in genome evolution.  Libraries, genome sequences and their annotations will be accessible via public databases and repositories, such as the AGI BAC/TEST Resource Center (http://www.genome.arizona.edu/orders/), NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and Gramene (www.gramene.org).Broader impacts.  This project will have broad impacts at several levels, including basic and applied research communities, postdoctoral/graduate/undergraduate and high school student training and mentoring, community outreach, and K-5 children and their families. For basic/applied research communities, the project will enhance and develop a genus-level resource as a platform for accessing new traits and alleles that is unparalleled in the plant world.  This transformative platform can be used to address fundamental hypothesis-driven questions as well as provide essential tools to improve the world's most important food crop.  The project will provide training and mentoring to postdoctoral scientists, graduate/undergraduate students and high school students interested in genome evolution, plant breeding, and careers in academic and corporate science.  Finally, the project will develop a biannual  Plant Science Family Night  program, targeting K-5 students and families, to get children and their families excited about plants and the role plant science plays in ensuring a safe, sustainable, and secure food supply for our planet.

335,"Scholars Award: The Long Arm of Moore's Law:New Institutions for Microelectronics Research, 1965-2005Cyrus C.M. ModyRice UniversityProject Summary Moore's Law (the doubling of components in commercial integrated circuits every 24 months) is the metronome of the microelectronics industry, the largest contributor to U.S. GDP.  This study extends recent histories of microelectronics by examining Moore's Law's indirect impact on institutions of American science.  The study focuses on three such impacts: the emergence of research communities dedicated to radical alternatives to silicon, such as superconducting computing or molecular electronics; the establishment of institutions for the new field of microfabrication; and the adaptation of miniaturization techniques for use by disciplines such as molecular biology.Intellectual merit This study's intellectual merit lies in tying progress in miniaturization to the wider context of the late/post Cold War.  Previous studies of post-1970 microelectronics focus on corporate actors following economic logic.  This study traces the involvement of a more diverse set of actors: creative scientists and engineers proposing radical replacements for silicon; Vietnam protestors on campuses such as Stanford; and scientists, grant officers, and universities coping with the tight budgets of the 1970s.  This study will yield a clearer picture of how American science and science policy were shaped in the late/post Cold War by a desire to benefit (from) microelectronics.Broader impacts There are two broader impacts of this study.  Content-wise, this study gives some ownership of Moore's Law to the public.  Technophilic writers often describe Moore's Law as beyond human control, but this study shows that public expectations about how much scientists should interact with the market, other disciplines, and the military formed a background for miniaturization. Methodologically, this study demonstrates the utility of geographically-dispersed and interdisciplinary collaborations for making history of technology policy-relevant.  This award augments collaborative work sponsored by the Center for Nanotechnology in Society at UCSB.  Research funded by this award will be published in articles co-authored with faculty and students in business schools and departments of English, sociology, history, and science and technology studies.

Olsen (Washington University) and Yulin Jia (University of Arkansas/USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center)Key Collaborators: David Gealy (University of Arkansas/USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center) and Nilda Burgos (University of Arkansas)Red rice is an aggressive, weedy form of cultivated rice that infests crop fields and is a primary factor limiting rice productivity in the U.S. and worldwide. As the weedy relative of a genomic model species, red rice is supremely suited to serve as a model for understanding the processes by which weediness emerges in agricultural settings. Previous work by this research group has revealed that red rice in the U.S. has arisen twice independently, in both cases from Asian domesticated rice. This project will further examine several complementary aspects of red rice evolution in three broad aims. First, leveraging current information about U.S. red rice origins, the project will examine the genetic basis by which weedy traits emerge. Candidate weedy genomic regions will be identified through comparison of whole-genome sequences of U.S. weedy rice strains with their putative cultivated ancestors, and through genetic analyses of weed-crop crosses. Second, the project will determine how the weed's origin and population structure compare among four world regions (South Asia, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, North America) that differ in the presence/absence of reproductively compatible wild species and in the predominant locally cultivated rice variety. Third, the project will assess how recent shifts in U.S. agriculture towards the use of imidazolinone (IMI) herbicide-resistant rice varieties are affecting the emergence of herbicide-resistant red rice. Specifically, the project will determine the relative roles of crop-weed gene flow versus spontaneous mutation in the creation of IMI-resistant weedy rice. Weedy crop relatives are a leading cause of crop losses worldwide, and this research will provide the first detailed examination of the genetic mechanisms and demographic processes by which weediness can evolve. The work will also provide basic insights into the impact of recent shifts to herbicide resistant rice farming on weed evolution, thereby providing critical data for devising effective weed control strategies. Other broader impacts of the project will involve training of a teacher summer intern through collaboration with the nationally recognized Washington University Science Outreach (WUSO); the teacher intern will create a  red rice  lab activity for classroom use, which will be made available on the web, publicized through science outreach programs, and supported locally through the WUSO materials warehouse. Teacher mentoring will also take the form of biotechnology research training to science faculty at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, a historically African-American institution. The project will also participate in the annual Rice Research and Extension Center Field Day held in Stuttgart (AR).  This popular event attracts a diverse cross-section of the public that include families, stake holders, state and regional rice research and extension specialists, industry representatives, congressional aides, and international visitors, providing an excellent opportunity to disseminate information about the the project and its relevance to rice agriculture.

338,"This project will reconstruct patterns of systemic stress among prehistoric Middle-Final Jomon period (5000-2500 BP) foragers from Japan using incremental enamel microstructures (perikymata) found within and between linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) defects. Results will help explain the biological impact of subsistence diversity among foragers and provide a biocultural framework for interpreting the spread of wet rice economies across the Japanese Islands. Jomon foragers from western Japan occupied an environment of low resource density and consumed foods with poor nutritional yield compared to groups from eastern and northern regions. Wet rice economies were introduced and adopted in western Japan around 2500 BP, followed by diffusion to eastern regions around 2300 BP, but failure to spread northward. Greater prevalence of LEH defects and reduced stature are reported among Jomon foragers from western Japan. This suggests that agricultural diffusion may have been influenced by systemic stress patterning, though the more finite components of stress including chronology, duration, and periodicity are poorly understood. Five hypotheses predicting greater defect prevalence, earlier stress chronology, greater stress duration, reduced time intervals between defects, and seasonal stress patterning for western compared to eastern and northern Jomon people will be tested. High resolution silicone impressions were collected for more than 1200 teeth from more than 500 Middle-Final Jomon period individuals recovered from over 15 archaeological sites on Hokkaido and Honshu Islands. Tooth replicas will be fashioned from these impressions for microscopic analysis. Perikymata spacing and counts derived from microscopic analysis of tooth replicas will then be used to reconstruct chronology, duration, periodicity and prevalence of stress between regional Jomon samples.Several aspects of this study contain significant intellectual merit. First, this study highlights the relationship between environmentally mediated behavioral choices and systemic stress in a behaviorally diverse group of foragers. Second, this study helps explain the relationship between systemic stress and phenotypic variation (long bone length). Third, this research explores the relationship between behavior, cultural diffusion, and systemic stress. Broader impacts of this study are as follows: First, large, widely comparable data-sets will be disseminated on a professional webpage. In addition, data sets accumulated by this study will be used for educational purposes in the classroom, while equipment purchased by this study will provide graduate students access to technological resources that can be used to test independent research hypotheses. Finally, tooth replicas manufactured by this study can be used by other researchers interested in questions involving life history and dental anthropology.

Sanchez (University of Arizona)Key Collaborator: Mathias Lorieux [International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia]West African cultivated rice (Oryza glaberrima) and its progenitor species, O. barthii, are a source of several traits important in crop improvement including pest resistance, drought tolerance, seedling vigor, weed competition, tolerance to toxic soils, grain quality and grain yield. To expand the impact of the advances being made in rice molecular genetics, rice seed stocks need to be developed for translational genomics efforts in the background of Asian rice (O. sativa) cultivars adapted to the USA. This RAPID project will generate critically needed genotyped genetic stocks that include both backcross inbred lines (BILs) and advanced backcross (ABC) mapping populations using three selected accessions of both O. glaberrima and O. barthii as the donor parent with US rice cultivars LaGrue and M-202.  These seed stocks will also serve as a resource for rice breeders to incorporate the abiotic and biotic stress resistance found in O. glaberrima and O. barthii. into their advanced breeding lines. All seed stocks will be distributed through the USDA-ARS Genetic Stocks - Oryza (GSOR) Collection (Stuttgart, AR).  All genotypic information will be available on-line through the AGI web site (www.genome.arizona.edu).  Beyond the impact of the resources generated, the project will provide training for a post-doctoral researcher who will be mentored in all aspects of managing a collaborative research project.  To encourage the next generation of plant scientists and breeders, the project will participate in existing outreach programs at the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center and the University of Arkansas Rice Research and Extension Center.  Finally, the project will also participate in the University of Arizona Undergraduate Biology Research Program (UBRP) which has links to statewide Community Colleges and targets funds for minorities.

340,"Hybrid systems, which combine discrete and continuous dynamics,provide sophisticated mathematical models for automated highwaysystems, air traffic control, biological systems, and otherapplications. A key feature of such systems is that they areoften deployed in safety-critical scenarios and hence designingsuch systems with provable guarantees is veryimportant. This is usually done through analysis of suchsystems with regard to a given set of safety properties thatassert that nothing 'bad' happens during the operation of thesystem. As more complex hybrid systems are considered, limitingsafety properties to a set of unsafe states, as in current methods,considerably restricts the ability of designers to adequatelyexpress the desired safe behavior of the system. To allowfor more sophisticated properties, researchers have advocatedthe use of linear temporal logic (LTL), which makes it possibleto express temporal safety properties. This proposal developsalgorithmic tools for safety analysis of embeddedand hybrid systems operating under the effect of exogenous inputsand for LTL specifications.  The problem addressedis the following: Given a hybrid system and a safety specificationdescribed using LTL, can a feasible trajectory be constructedfor the system that violates the specification, when such atrajectory exists? The problem is called the falsification problem.The broader impact of the project is implemented throughcourse development, involvement in research activities ofundergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students, efforts tomentor underrepresented groups, and dissemination of conceptsthrough educational software developed at Rice.

341,"1033552BennettIntellectual MeritThe production of biofuels from renewable resources is currently an area national interest.  In particular, butanol isomers have gained interest as an alternative fuel due to their superior fuel properties to relative to ethanol.  The proposed research will use metabolic engineering approaches to enable the fermentation of the non-digestible, soluble carbohydrate fraction isolated from many common oilseeds such as soybean, cottonseed, and sunflower seed, to butanol.  Many of these materials are byproducts of biodiesel or bioethanol production.  For example, large amounts of galactose-rich soluble carbohydrates, constituting approximately 10% of oil seed weight, represent a sustainable yet underutilized feedstock for biofuel.  Towards this end, the hydrolysis of the galactose-rich oligosaccharides and subsequent fermentation to 2-butanol by engineered E. coli will be studied and optimized.   Furthermore, natural and engineered strains of Clostridia may also be able make effective use of this feedstock.   Genetic modules for engineered strains of Clostridia will be developed that enable the efficient uptake and metabolism of galactose-rich oligosaccharides and their fermentation to 1-butanol.Broader ImpactsThe education plan will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in biochemical engineering, molecular biology, and biochemistry.   Undergraduate students from under-represented groups will be recruited for these activities through existing programs at Rice University.   As part of the outreach plan, after school and summer research experiences for local high school students will be coordinated through the Harmony Science Academy, a largely minority charter school.

343,"The conference is the fourth of a series of symposia. The goal of the Symposia is to examine the role that Optimality can play, or should play, in modern statistics. Due to the advent of high throughput data collection technology and the parallel development of computing power to analyze such data, it often happens that statistical theory gives way to raw computing power. Although most of the new exciting computational/statistical methodologies have provided tools to make headway in many important scientific problems, a need to generalize and systematize this knowledge is now quite evident. The Symposia will bring together a group of experts to discuss cutting-edge research optimality ideas in the context of modern statistical methodologies. It is believed that, although much progress has taken place in areas such as data visualization and data mining and knowledge discovery among others, the subjects are ripe for the development of an optimality paradigm that allows for objective comparisons of methodologies. This new paradigm, although still to be defined, is necessary to push the research frontiers in these important areas. The conference will showcase new developments by leading researchers in an environment conducive to the development of new human resources and an opening session will showcase the work of young investigators.With the substantial contributions that statistics continues to make to the analyses of massive high-dimensional data arising in the biomedical sciences, national security, reliability of urban infrastructures, atmospheric sciences, etc, the need to synthesize this knowledge to more efficiently and effectively analyze such data has come to the forefront of the discipline. Current statistical efforts, for example, leading to a better understanding of the stochastic behavior of the power grid, should help in the creation of an intelligent grid that can better respond to changes in the grid's status and thus avert cascading failures that currently cost in the order of $104 billion dollars in the United States alone. The symposium will provide a forum to showcase the exciting and impacting theoretical work that needs to be developed to better understand the behavior of these complex systems. In addition, the symposium will provide the environment for the maturing of young researchers and the development of more human resources in these important areas.

344,"PROJECT ABSTRACT  Counting Van Gogh and Vermeer  Automated thread counting algorithms, in development since 2007 by Professors Rick Johnson (Cornell University) and Don Johnson (Rice University), are poised for a profound impact on the practice of technical art history. This work is a pioneering effort in the emerging application of signal and image processing to the analysis of paintings. The approach is based on the utilization of spectral analysis of x-rays of paintings. X-rays can display the periodic intensity pattern due to the greater thickness of the lead white ground between the canvas threads. With the addition of innovative application-speci&#64257;c signal processing, local peaks in the spectrum of the x-ray data can reveal the numbers of threads per centimeter, i.e. a thread count, separately for (nearly) vertically and (nearly) horizontally oriented threads. Such thread counts have been used previously, but their manual acquisition proved too costly to be done thoroughly. The introduction of the capability to assemble previously unthinkable thread density and angle pattern maps of high detail across the entire surface of a painting leads to correlation-based identi&#64257;cation of canvases sharing the same pattern in thread density variations. Such weave maps and matches can now be assembled across all of the paintings on canvas of a single artist or school, thereby significantly extending the art historian's capabilities in, for example, dating and attribution. The scale, breadth, and depth of such thread-counting projects represent a bold leap in the capabilities of technical art history. This grant supports the analysis phase of the projects of such grand scope: the thread counting and subsequent weave matching among (i) all of the paintings by Vincent van Gogh (for which data can be obtained by the end of 2010) and (ii) all of the paintings by the Delft School during the career of Johannes Vermeer (for which data can be obtained by the end of 2010). This grant places Professors Rick and Don Johnson in the center of the data fusion, data analysis and database creation activities that are scheduled to occur in Amsterdam during the spring of 2011. The archives being established of thread count reports, including weave density maps providing fingerprints for weave matching and angle maps for characterizing cusping, form a groundbreaking resource at a time when museums are just beginning to address the technological and cultural barriers to technical data sharing among museums and collaborating researchers outside the museum. This project is part of a long-term effort that aims to expand the utility of thread counting from x-rays to all suitable oil paintings on canvas, and to photos of unlined backs of old master paintings and of the raw canvas, for example, of the modern colorfield painters and of densely-woven, multi-pattern fabrics prominent in the design and decorative arts.

The approach is based on the utilization of spectral analysis of x-rays of paintings. X-rays can display the periodic intensity pattern due to the greater thickness of the lead white ground between the canvas threads. With the addition of innovative application-speci&#64257;c signal processing, local peaks in the spectrum of the x-ray data can reveal the numbers of threads per centimeter, i.e. a thread count, separately for (nearly) ver- tically and (nearly) horizontally oriented threads. Such thread counts have been used previously, but their manual acquisition proved too costly to be done thoroughly. The introduction of the capability to assemble previously unthinkable thread density and angle pattern maps of high de- tail across the entire surface of a painting leads to correlation-based identi&#64257;cation of canvases sharing the same pattern in thread density variations. Such weave maps and matches can now be assembled across all of the paintings on canvas of a single artist or school, thereby signi&#64257;cantly extending the art historian?s capabilities in, for example, dating and attribution. The scale, breadth, and depth of such thread-counting projects represent a bold leap in the capabilities of technical art history. This grant supports the analysis phase of the &#64257;rst projects of such grand scope: the thread counting and subsequent weave matching among (i) all of the paintings by Vincent van Gogh (for which data can be obtained by the end of 2010) and (ii) all of the paintings by the Delft School during the career of Johannes Vermeer (for which data can be obtained by the end of 2010). This grant places Professors Rick and Don Johnson in the center of the data fusion, data analysis and database creation activities that are scheduled to occur in Amsterdam during the spring of 2011. The archives being established of thread count reports, including weave density maps providing &#64257;ngerprints for weave matching and angle maps for characterizing cusping, form a groundbreaking resource at a time when museums are just beginning to address the technological and cultural barriers to technical data sharing among museums and collaborating researchers outside the museum. This project is part of a long-term effort that aims to expand the utility of thread counting from x-rays to all suitable oil paintings on canvas, and to photos of unlined backs of old master paintings and of the raw canvas, for example, of the modern color&#64257;eld painters and of densely-woven, multi-pattern fabrics prominent in the design and decorative arts.

346,"With co-funding from the Instrument Development for Biological Research and the Chemistry of Life Processes programs, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program is supporting an EAGER award to Prof. Jason Hafner of Rice University, seeking new ways to characterize structures like biological membranes - the thin sheets of molecules that support many critical biological functions of living cells.  While the external electrical properties of membranes are well understood, their internal electrical properties are not.  One such internal property is the dipole potential, which arises from molecular alignment in the membrane. Although this potential has been studied for decades, it is among the least understood aspects of membranes.  There is currently no definitive measure of the size of this potential, or even agreement about which components of the membrane create it. It has been hypothesized that this potential significantly affects membrane biology, but such a correlation has not been confirmed since there is currently no satisfactory way to measure the dipole potential. This project will further develop a recently discovered method to measure the membrane dipole potential using an atomic force microscope (AFM).  These activities will result in a quantitative tool to measure an important yet poorly understood property of biological membranes, the site of many critical biological functions and the actions of most drug molecules.  Students will be supported and trained in an interdisciplinary manner in both experimental research and theoretical simulations.  The research results and instrumentation concepts from this project will be used in 9th grade Integrated Physics and Chemistry (IPC) teacher training programs at Rice.  The work will also provide research experiences for summer teacher interns in Prof. Hafner's laboratory.

347,"Network-data-plane-disrupting bugs can cause the disruption ofcritical network applications. Unfortunately, today, there exists nocomprehensive solution for detecting data-plane-disruptingbugs. Consequently, the network operator has few useful leads forinvestigating bug-triggered problems. To bridge this gap, this projectdevelops novel measurement-based solutions for automatic bug detectionthat are accurate and scalable. The results from this project willsignificantly improve the reliability of current and future generationnetworks. The expected results include network measurement techniques,data analysis methods, network-wide monitoring strategies, datastructures and algorithms for high performance bug detection, and buglocalization techniques. These solutions will (1) save IT personnelresources because network operators no longer need to troubleshoot anentire complex network but instead can focus on finding the bestsolution for a detected bug; (2) reduce negative impact of bugsbecause the operator can immediately take proper defensive actions;(3) improve assurance after software or hardware updates sinceincorrect data plane behaviors resulting from updates could beautomatically caught; (4) improve feedback to vendors since vendorscan receive valuable information correlating detected bugs toconfigurations, updates, configuration changes, etc., which helpsvendors diagnose the problem's root cause and develop solutions.

348,"Mark A. Johnson      IOS-1021917HAP2(GCS1): Mechanisms of double fertilizationThe molecular mechanisms that allow gamete cells (sperm and egg) to fuse are unknown. Overcoming this gap in our knowledge is an important goal because gamete fusion is central to the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms. Flowering plants (including major crops like corn, rice, and soybean) undergo double fertilization: one sperm fuses with the egg cell to form an embryo and another sperm fuses with the central cell to produce endosperm, a specialized tissue that supports the embryo. These cell fusion events lead to formation of seeds, the basis of the human food system. Gaining greater understanding of gamete fusion in flowering plants will lead to technologies that can improve seed crop production and control reproduction of crop plants. The hap2-1 mutant was identified using genetic analysis in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. hap2-1 mutant sperm appear normal, but fail to fuse with either the egg or the central cell.  These mutants lack a protein, HAP2(GCS1), that is normally on the surface of sperm cells. The hypothesis that will be tested in this project is that the HAP2(GCS1) protein is directly involved in a process that allows the male and female gametes to fuse.  The goals of this project are 1) to identify new proteins that participate with HAP2(GCS1) to mediate gamete fusion, 2) to identify proteins that regulate the function of HAP2(GCS1), and 3) to determine how HAP2(GCS1) and other proteins allow gamete cells to fuse.  The results of this project will have broad scientific impacts because HAP2(GCS1) is found in many eukaryotic species and is likely part of a gamete fusion mechanism employed by many plants and animals.  This project will provide cutting-edge research training for both female and male undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers of diverse backgrounds.

349,"Purdue University is awarded a grant to develop ionomicHUB (iHUB), an international collaborative cyber research environment to enhance our ability to identify and understand the genes and gene networks that function to control the ionome, the mineral nutrient and trace element composition of an organism or tissue. The iHUB is a collaborative workspace with components that integrate both cyberinfrastructure and human interactions to maximize both community access to ionomic resources, and knowledge extraction from these resources. Specifically, the iHUB project will deliver (1) tools to allow the easy sharing and annotation of data, (2) the LitCloud: A tool to allow the easy filtering and sharing of literature, (3) tools to allow the coordinated collection of ionomics data from distributed sites, (4) tools to allow the easy sharing of presentations and lectures, (5) tools to allow the self formation of online work groups and communication, (6) the iHUB interaction map (iHUB interactome), and (7) on-line help tools. The iHUB will be founded on the existing public ionomics database (www.ionomicshub.org) which currently contains ionomic data on over 200,000 samples, including Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To ensure integration of the iHUB with the community we also plan workshops and scientist exchanges.These iHUB functionalities will help bridge the growing gap between the high-throughput generation of ionomic data and the efficient probing of gene function on a genomic and comparative genomic scale. The iHUB will facilitate open communication and exchange of information, and will lower the barrier for entry into the field of ionomics, allowing a diverse set of researchers from developed and developing nations to participate in advancing the field. The information obtained from the discoveries facilitated by the iHUB will be valuable from the point of view of improving crop yields, enhancing agricultural sustainability, and improving food quality for human nutrition.

Brad Barbazuk (University of Florida - Gainesville), James Leebens-Mack (University of Georgia - Athens), Hong Ma (Pennsylvania State University), Douglas E. Soltis (University of Florida - Gainesville), and Pamela S. Soltis (University of Florida - Gainesville)Collaborators: Jeffrey D. Palmer (Indiana State University), Steven D. Rounsley (University of Arizona), Stephan C. Schuster (Pennsylvania State University), and Susan R. Wessler (University of Georgia - Athens) The origin and early diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) had profound impacts on Earth's biota, providing the raw genetic material from which most crops and economically important plants were derived. The diversification of genes, genomes, and important traits cannot be adequately interpreted without a comparative framework firmly rooted with genome sequences from basal angiosperms. A genome sequence of Amborella trichopoda will provide a foundation for all comparative analyses of angiosperm gene content and genome structure. Among basal angiosperms, Amborella has the most extensive genomic resources, already possessing high-quality genomic libraries, a physical map, and a large expressed gene (transcriptome) database. These resources, along with its pivotal phylogenetic position and moderate genome size (870 million base pairs), make Amborella the singular choice for the first basal angiosperm to be fully sequenced. The Amborella genome project will:  1) complete the physical map of Amborella; 2) generate a high-quality draft sequence and assembly of the Amborella genome using  next generation  sequencing methods and a cost-effective strategy that has been tested on rice genomes and is superior to traditional sequencing methodologies; and 3) develop bioinformatic tools and public access websites to display the project database as it is produced, and support comparative analyses and data mining by the scientific community at large.Broader Impacts: The Amborella genome, and the strategies being used to obtain and analyze the genome, will provide a unique scientific resource broadly impacting plant biology as well as excellent opportunities to demonstrate the utility of comparative genomics across the biological sciences. A reference for angiosperm genome content and organization will benefit the analysis of all currently available angiosperm genome sequences and those that are obtained in the future.  Comparative genomics workshops for middle and high school teachers will be held and teaching modules for broad dissemination of project outcomes and the utility of comparative genomics will be created. In addition, the project will expand a successful cross-cultural scientific mentoring program involving minority undergraduate students at each of the participating universities, train postdoctoral scientists and graduate students, and create mentoring opportunities for inner-city high school students to help them consider careers in the plant sciences. Specific mentoring activities for the post-docs will enhance their professional development.  The project website (www.Amborella.org) will provide public access to all data, project results, and long-term repositories.

351,"TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis award supports theoretical and computational research and educational activities related to the treatment of transport and nonlinear effects in multilayered devices composed of strongly correlated multilayers. New formalisms and computational algorithms will be developed and then applied to systems that are being investigated experimentally by leading experimental groups around the world.In particular, the work includes:(i) Development of a new method for numerical renormalization group calculations that removes the ad hoc broadening and is able to accurately treat both high and low energy scales, enabling calculation of dc transport in both insulators and Fermi liquids. (ii) Development of a Green's function based density functional theory approach for determining thermoelectric properties of multilayered systems. This technique will be used to formulate design rules for how to maintain (or increase) the Seebeck effect when thermoelectric materials are incorporated into multilayer structures designed to block phonon transport.(iii) Development of an exact non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory approach to determine the current-voltage characteristic of a multilayered device described by a current biased Falicov-Kimball model. A strong-coupling based approach for the non-equilibrium impurity problem (similar to a hybridization expansion for continuous time quantum Monte Carlo approaches) to treat Hubbard and periodic Anderson models at strong coupling and with large driving fields will also be examined.(iv) Investigation of strong correlation effects on the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor in which the dielectric layers or the metallic plates are replaced by strongly correlated materials. This theoretical and computational work will be coordinated with experimental efforts, including those of Jochen Mannhart in Germany (capacitors), Yuji Matsuda in Japan (charge and heat transport in heavy fermion multilayers), and Doug Natelson at Rice University, US (switching effects in contacts and in the bulk of strongly correlated materials).This project supports the training of graduate students in computational physics, both in the academic research environment and through year-long research internships at the IBM Almaden Research Center. The project also provides research experiences for undergraduate students, who will learn about international collaboration in science through summer internships at the Institute for Physics in Zagreb, Croatia.

These materials have a large sensitivity to their environment, which makes them suitable for use in so-called smart-material devices which can improve the way many different electronic devices work.  New formalisms and computational algorithms will be developed and then applied to systems that are being investigated experimentally by leading experimental groups around the world.  Some examples include (i) examining how capacitance (capacity to store charge) can be modified in these systems, (ii) examining heat-induced electrical current or electrical current-induced heat transport in such multi-layer systems of sizes some 100,000 times smaller than the human hair, and (iii) examining how Ohm's law (which states that the voltage drop across a resistor is linearly proportional to the current through it) is violated in these devices by studying the so-called non-linear effects, that could potentially lead to ultrafast electronic switches. This project supports the training of graduate students in computational physics, both in the academic research environment and through year-long research internships at the IBM Almaden Research Center. The project also provides research experiences for undergraduate students, who will learn about international collaboration in science through summer internships at the Institute for Physics in Zagreb, Croatia.

352,"A Toolbox for Large-Scale Analysis of Structural Molecular DataWilliam Marsh Rice University is awarded a grant to design and implement an extensible and computationally efficient toolbox that integrates sequence information and existing molecular metadata with structural analysis of proteins. One of the most challenging tasks in modern biology is the interpretation of the massive amounts of data becoming available through recent genomics, proteomics and related advances. Proteins are the cell's worker molecules, so there is a tremendous interest to understand how they behave, relate to each other, and how they regulate physiological processes. At the core of the toolbox is a fast and scalable substructure matching method that finds correspondences of a three-dimensional set of atoms (a motif) to a set of protein structures. The goal is to provide biologists with a versatile 'Swiss army knife' for probing the relationship between protein structure and function. The toolbox will be built in a way that it will automatically draw metadata information from relevant online databases in order to be continuously up-to-date. The output will not only report and visualize the results but link to online sources for further evaluation and analysis. The broader impacts of this project will strengthen biological infrastructure by providing a versatile computational toolbox for the analysis of protein structure and function. The toolbox will be widely disseminated (1) as a web service, (2) as a downloadable package with a command line and Python module interface, and (3) as a plug-in for Chimera, a popular, free molecular modeling program. Besides working with their collaborators, the PIs will reach out to interest groups and related conferences for building a community of users for the proposed tool and encourage the contribution of novel workflows by the scientific community.   Students involved in the project will be trained as part of a highly interdisciplinary team, and educational and research activities (through CRA-W, the Computer Research Association's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research) for undergraduate students are planned.

Gill (Washington State University)CoPIs: Johar Singh (Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India) and Devinder Sandhu (University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point)Key Collaborators: Kanwarpal S. Dhugga (Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.), Gurmukh S. Johal (Purdue University), Mustafa Shafqat (COMSATS University, Abbottabad, Pakistan), Harindra S. Balyan and Pushpendra K. Gupta (Meerut University, India), and Madhu Meeta Jindal (Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India)Genes influencing plant height have revolutionized agriculture by doubling the wheat and rice production. Under conditions of environmental stress, the most predominantly used wheat semi-dwarf mutants rht1 and rht2 exhibit adverse effects on agronomic traits including coleoptile and first leaf length, root length and biomass, as well as drought tolerance. These adverse effects limit wheat yields under abiotic stress conditions that regularly affect more than 85% of the US and about 50% of the world wheat production area. The main goal of the project is to identify and characterize an alternative dwarfing gene system for wheat and other cereals in order to alleviate adverse effects of the currently used dwarfing genes.  Currently used dwarfing gene systems in wheat reduce plant height by interrupting production or signaling of plant growth hormone gibberellins that are particularly important for plants to deal with stressful conditions.  Previous studies have shown that mutations in the maize brachytic2 (br2) and the sorghum dwarf3 (dw3) genes that encode P-glycoproteins (PGPs) involved in polar transport of auxin, result in a reduction in plant height without any of the adverse phenotypic effects usually associated with the currently used wheat dwarfing mutants.  Based on these observations, this project will test whether the wheat ortholog (TaBr2) of the maize Br2 gene can be used as an alternative dwarfing gene system in wheat.  Specific objectives are to clone TaBr2 and to study its expression and function in wheat using various reverse genetics tools including virus-induced gene silencing and RNAi.  In addition, mutations in TaBr2 will be isolated using phenotypic as well as by TILLING screens in order to identify the ideal dwarfing mutant.  The benefit of the project, especially to farmers with small land holdings, will come from the introgression of value-added genes, including stripe rust resistance genes as well as newly-developed dwarfing gene mutants, into popular varieties of India, Pakistan, and the US.  In addition, the project will provide new insight into the process of auxin signaling and transport in crop plants.  The project will provide highly interdisciplinary and international research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for research associates/visiting scientists.   The PIs are actively involved in outreach activities including farmers' Field Days, talking to grower groups and organizing lab demonstrations and displays to grower groups and the public at large. The project information and findings will be communicated with the public via these efforts as well as through electronic means.   A project website will be developed that will serve as a  one-stop  location for access to all resources generated in this project.  Links will be provided to this project webpage from each of the investigator's web pages as well.   Expression and sequence data will be immediately submitted to GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), according to the currently accepted community standard (e.g. Bermuda/Ft. Lauderdale agreement). Real-time expression data of selected genes on various wheat lines will be made freely available first via publications and then by hosting on the project webpage and on Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/). Mapping data will be available at GrainGenes database (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml).  All VIGS and RNAi constructs and germplasm generated in this project will be maintained in the PIs' lab and will be available to the public.

357,"PI: Brett Tyler (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University)CoPIs: Shunyuan Xiao (University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute) and Mark Guiltinan (Pennsylvania State University)Collaborator: Brian Bailey (USDA-ARS Sustainable Perennial Crops Lab, Beltsville, Maryland)Small-holder agriculture in developing countries is exceptionally susceptible to fungal and oomycete disease due to lack of local breeding programs, tropical climate, abundant insect vectors, cost of and poor access to fungicides, and lack of farmer education. Small-holder farmers in Africa and South America are responsible for more than 95% of cacao production, providing economic benefits to millions of cacao farmers and their dependents, as well as important ecological benefits such as rain-forest preservation. Fungal and oomycete diseases have devastated cacao production in South America and West Africa, dislocating populations of farmers and resulting in destruction of the rain-forest sheltering the cacao trees in favor of large-scale open farmland. This project will test two novel approaches to protecting developing country crops against a broad-spectrum of oomycete and fungal pathogens, using cacao as the initial target. The first involves targeting anti-microbial proteins to pathogen feeding structures called haustoria, using RPW8, an Arabidopsis protein that has a natural affinity for these feeding sites. The second approach involves blocking the entry of virulence proteins (effector proteins) that pathogens secrete into host cells to suppress the plant host's immune system. The most effective strategies will be identified first using fast growing Arabidopsis and tomato plants before being tested in cacao.Broader Impacts: The novel technologies that will be tested in this project are potentially applicable to an extremely broad array of crop diseases important to the developing world. The most destructive diseases of broad acreage staples such as rice and wheat are potentially amenable to this approach, as are many of the most limiting fungal and oomycete diseases of crops of importance to smallholders, such as yams, cassava, groundnuts, pearl millet, finger millet, sorghum, maize, potato, bean and cowpea. The project includes visits from scientists from developing countries, a colloquium in Ecuador, and regular communication with scientists from cacao-producing countries.  Project outcomes as well as access to biological resources that include DNA constructs and germplasm will be disseminated through a project website (accessible via https://www.vbi.vt.edu/faculty/research_groups/brett_tyler) and through publications.

358,"PI:  Stephen L. Dellaporta, Yale University CoPIs: Maria A. Moreno (Yale University), Albert Kausch (University of Rhode Island), Joe Tohme and Cesar Martinez [International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)] Most plants, including rice and several major cereal crops, have perfect flowers that have both pistils and stamens.  Maize, however, displays monoecy, having separate flowers with just pistils or stamens on the same plant.  This floral partitioning promotes outcrossing and makes efficient hybrid seed production possible.  Hybrid plants often show  heterosis , or hybrid vigor, a genetic phenomenon contributing to increases in biomass, yield, and disease and pest resistance as compared to their inbred parents.  The goal of this project is to extend high throughput hybrid technologies to rice and other cereals using a variety of genetic and molecular approaches.  One approach is to investigate monoecy genes of maize (tasselseed and silkless genes) in rice and cereal crops to understand functional differences that exist.   A second approach is to exploit natural floral variation in related species to rice that exhibit degrees of monoecy.  This variation (traits) will be mapped to specific genes and introduced into rice by inter-specific hybridization or transformation.  The third approach is to create pistillate and staminate florets in rice by introducing transgenes capable of eliminating either pistils or stamens, thereby generating a synthetic system for hybrid seed production.  At the basic scientific level, these studies will provide a deeper understanding of processes such as cell death, cell cycle arrest and hormonal regulation of flowering.  Understanding the function of these monoecy genes in related cereals will provide information as to the origins of floral diversification in cereals.BROADER IMPACT: Extending hybrid technologies to cereal crops such as rice with have a broader impact on human health and the environment. The lack of sufficient food supply remains one of the greatest challenges in the 21st century, comparable in mortality rates to the threat from emerging infectious diseases. Technologies for hybrid rice production, and associated increases in yields, will help to relieve hunger and famine in the world's poorest populations. Increasing yield through heterosis can have a beneficial environmental impact by minimizing the destruction of natural habitats as the world's population continues to multiply. The project's educational component focuses on high school, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate training opportunities in plant molecular biology and genomics.  All three institutions will mentor undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in research associated with the BREAD project.  The project will sponsor several minority students from California State University at Fresno, a Hispanic-serving institution, in Yale's HHMI-sponsored Science, Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) summer program. The STARS program identifies underrepresented bioscience majors and mentors them into higher-than-average levels of performance. Two international students, recruited by CIAT from several Colombian universities, will be invited to join Yale's STARS program each summer. Lastly, outreach activities will be coordinated with the Peabody Museum at Yale, one of the largest public museum between New York and Boston visited by 110,000 people annually. The Museum's Evolutions (EVOking Learning and Understanding through Investigations of the Natural Sciences) serves high school students targeted from underserved populations from selected public schools. All sequence data will be released to GenBank and all biological materials, vectors and reagents generated will be available upon request through Yale and CIAT and can be accessed through a project website (to be developed).

359,"TECHNICAL SUMMARYRecent studies of a team by A. Jákli, J.T. Gleeson and S. Sprunt  at Kent State University have clearly demonstrated that fluids built from  bent-core  (or  banana  -shaped) molecules exhibit strikingly different properties from those composed of rod-shape materials; examples include anomalous flow viscosity and giant electro-mechanical coupling the latter being of high technological promise for molecular-scale energy conversion applications. These materials also apparently possess complex structure on the nanometer scale, and exhibit indications of novel states of matter.  To develop a complete comprehension of these structures, the Kent State Group will utilize a powerful range of carefully targeted experimental techniques, available in house or through active participation in national user facilities. Specific new classes of reduced-symmetry materials to be investigated include molecules having W, T, X and H-shape, exciting new polymeric fluids and gels based on bent-core molecules, as well as previously uninvestigated low molecular weight bent-core molecules. The specific research objectives and scientific benefits of the proposed research are: (1) specific elucidation of nanoscopic structure in bent-core fluids; (2) investigation into the origins and limits of anomalously large coupling between electric properties and mechanical deformation (3) studies of strongly asymmetric bent-core molecules that form novel three-dimensional structures; (4) investigation of the optical and electro-mechanical properties of main- and side- chain polymers containing bent-core sub-units; and (5) studies of structured fluids under high magnetic fields to search for field-induced symmetry breaking transitions.NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARYStructured fluids are not only of fundamental scientific interest but have also enormous technological importance.  Perhaps the most familiar example is liquid crystals, whose applications range from iPod screens to bullet-proof vests. The key factor determining the physical behavior of structured fluids is the symmetry properties of the molecular constituents. The team of A. Jákli, J.T. Gleeson and S. Sprunt at Kent State University will study compounds whose building blocks are not simple rods as in traditional liquid crystals, but either bent-shape, W, T, X and H shaped. A symmetry change in underlying molecule shape can lead to dramatically different and technologically promising behavior of a fluid composed of such molecules.  This project offers the promise of significant advances in technology, such as low-cost, wearable (or potentially bio-implantable) electricity generators based on enhanced electro-mechanical coupling and a new generation of fast, low-power reflective color displays. The proposed research will provide critical feedback for synthetic chemists to improve material properties; key collaborators in this effort include Profs. R. Twieg (Department of Chemistry, Kent State University) and R. Verduzco (Department of Chemical Engineering, Rice University). The team's multi-faceted education program will train doctoral students to be effective players in a twenty-first century entrepreneurial environment. The principal investigators also will bring undergraduates, particularly from colleges serving traditionally under-represented groups, into a cutting-edge research environment, with the goal of increasing their participation in the high-tech workforce of tomorrow.Support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program is acknowledged.

360,"AbstractAgriculture is inherently risky, perpetually under threat from draughts, hurricanes, floods, pests and crop diseases. In response to farmers' need to manage risk, governments and policy makers throughout the world have for decades attempted to provide public crop insurance or promote its private provision. Almost all such attempts have failed to operate sustainably without government subsidies.Project: The researchers propose to study the reasons for this failure of crop insurance. They will, in partnership with the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation, a government entity, implement an experimental crop insurance program offered to rice farmers in rural Philippines. The design will allow them to separately identify the extent of adverse selection (i.e. when demand for insurance is higher among farmers who are more at risk) and moral hazard (i.e. lowered incentives of covered farmers to prevent damages), the main barriers to efficient workings of insurance markets.Intellectual merit: Using recent developments in experimental methodology, the researchers will be able to provide an empirical foundation for seminal theoretical papers on the economics of contracts by empirically decomposing these theoretical mechanisms. In addition, they will go beyond recent experimental contributions by incorporating measures of preferences, such as an individuals' aversion to risk, to further decompose the contract selection decision. This empirical evidence will contribute to the iterative process, from theory to testing and back to theory, that is so essential to the advancement of scientific knowledge.Broader impacts: The research has the promise to have broad implications for the design and implementation of public insurance programs. The findings will improve understanding of the workings of insurance markets and may lead to better regulation and more efficient insurance markets. Finally, it will help in the design of crop insurance programs in particular and thereby improve both risk management options for poor rural farmers and the governments' use of public funds for rural development. abstracting; Agriculture; Back; Contracts; design; Development; Disease; Economics; farmer; Floods; Foundations; Funding; Government; Government Subsidy; hazard; Hurricane; improved; Incentives; Individual; Insurance; Knowledge; Lead; Marketing; Measures; Methodology; Morals; Paper; Philippines; Policy Maker; preference; prevent; Process; programs; Regulation; Research; Research Personnel; response; Rice; Risk; Risk Management; Rural; Rural Developments; Seminal; Testing; theories; WorkDOCTORAL DISSERTATION RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS: HIDDEN INFORMATION AND HIDDEN ACTION IN RURAL CROP INSURANCE MARKETS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999

The focus of the program is biological networks -- the complex interactions among biomolecules that give rise to the diverse biological phenotypes observed in nature. The goal is to provide students first hand experience with cutting-edge interdisciplinary research that is needed to predict biological functions sufficiently in order to reprogram cells to avoid diseases or to perform new tasks. In the REU program, students will work on research projects under faculty mentors that draw from a range of approaches (classical biochemical and genetic to theoretical models that require computation) to study naturally-occurring genetic networks, artificial genetic and metabolic networks, and biomolecular structure, function, and evolution. This program will also provide: a creative opportunity for students to develop innovative biotechnological ideas; leadership development; seminars and career development workshops; stipend and travel support; on-campus housing; a capstone research poster symposium; and an ethics and responsible conduct of research discussion seminar. Students will be recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on recruiting women and under-represented minorities, and selection of students will be done based on the faculty steering committee's evaluation of each applicant's transcript, personal statement regarding their interest and motivation for research, and recommendation letters. Assessment of this program is done via pre- and post-questionnaires as well by using the NSF-supported common assessment tool.

364,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).Particle physics stands at the threshold of a new era of discovery as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) begins colliding-beam operations this fall. With the highest-energy collisions ever created in a laboratory environment, the CMS collaboration (about 1600 physicists world-wide) will study some of the most fundamental questions of our time, such as the origin of mass, the possible existence of supersymmetry, and the hypothetical existence of extra spatial dimensions. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), one of two general-purpose detectors at the LHC (the other detector is called ATLAS and has a similar number of collaborators), has been designed to discover the new physics of this energy scale. At the heart of CMS is the silicon pixel detector. The current device took years to design and build and represents the state-of-the-art for this type detector. However, it is well known that it will eventually fail due to radiation damage and a new device with enhanced characteristics must be designed and built to take its place. This award funds Professor Alice Bean, Professor of Physics at the University of Kansas, and a consortium of six universities (Kansas, Kansas State, Illinois at Chicago, Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, Rice, and Rutgers) to develop a detector that will serve as a research instrument for the design of the phase 1 upgraded silicon pixel detector for CMS.The broader impacts can be divided into two categories - those related to the development of the research and training infrastructure at collaborating institutions and those related to the impacts on the field of high energy physics as a whole. In particle physics the capability to design and build instrumentation is crucial to the success of any university group in this field. This award provides the means for the collaborators to enhance the prestige and capability of the respective institutions at an international level. In addition, the development activities will allow recruiting undergraduate students, especially women and minorities, to help build this instrument and participate in the physics studies  and should help attract more students into physics and engineering.

368,"Almost all plants fix CO2 into carbohydrate using an ancient photosynthetic process termed C3 photosynthesis (i.e., C3 plants). A subset of plants utilize a more efficient photosynthetic process termed C4 photosynthesis (i.e., C4 plants). In open sunny environments the rate of CO2 fixation, biomass accumulation, and grain yield in C4 plants is nearly twice that of C3 plants. The increased photosynthetic performance of C4 versus C3 plants is due in part to the evolution of an additional set of photosynthetic CO2 fixation enzymes referred to as the C4 pathway. Despite the inherently higher productivity of C4 versus C3 plants, there are only four agronomically important C4 crop species: maize, Sorghum, sugar cane, and switch grass. All other crop species (e.g., rice, soybean, wheat) are C3 plants. Thus an ongoing research goal of plant scientists is to breed or engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop plants for improving yields. Efforts to date have fallen short in part because of the lack of understanding on how the C4 pathway is controlled in leaves for optimizing use of available sunlight. The ultimate aim of this project is to elucidate how such regulation works. A first step in this endeavor, and the goal of this one-year project, is to develop maize plants that are deficient in two interrelated light-responsive C4 pathway enzymes, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and the PPDK regulatory protein (RP). It is hypothesized that these enzymes control the rate of the CO2 fixation by the C4 pathway in response to sunlight. Using RNA interference, a genetic engineering method, stable lines of maize plants will be isolated with reduced levels of PPDK or RP enzyme. These plants will be subsequently assessed for photosynthetic performance. From these analyses, an accurate picture of how PPDK and RP confer sunlight-responsive C4 pathway regulation is expected to emerge.

Nettleton, and Adah Leshem-Ackerman (Iowa State University)Collaborator:  Pietro Spanu [Imperial College (UK)]Plant diseases are among the greatest detriments to crop production worldwide.  The plant immune system plays a crucial role in preventing infection by responding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and effector proteins delivered by the pathogen.  This project focuses on the well-characterized barley-powdery mildew pathosystem to address fundamental questions in susceptibility and host resistance. The project will build upon the recent discovery of a new monocot-specific family of cysteine-rich peptides, designated blufensins.  Blufensin1 (Bln1) negatively regulates plant defense during fungal infection.  BLN1 is predicted to be secreted, and contains both structural and sequence similarities to knottins, small disulfide-rich proteins characterized by a unique  disulfide through disulfide knot.   The project team will perform comparative analysis of host (barley) versus nonhost (maize and rice) interactions with powdery mildew that define the interactome of cereals with this important fungal pathogen.  Plants silenced for Bln1 will be interrogated by Barley1 GeneChip transcript profiling to identify significant new genes in the regulation of host innate immunity. Complementary investigations will be carried out with international collaborators that lead the powdery mildew genome sequence consortium to isolate powdery mildew effectors, which will then be used to identify important plant targets that promote or suppress defense.  For this, the project will employ a new Xanthomonas type III secretion delivery vector to determine function in plant cells.  Characterization of effectors will be carried out in all three cereals to identify and compare plant genes that govern host and non-host interactions.  High-throughput reverse genetic tools will be utilized to functionally characterize genes identified via the Bln1- and powdery mildew effector-based approaches.  Data will be integrated into PLEXdb (http://plexdb.org/), the unified gene expression resource for plants and plant pathogens, for genetic and regulatory network analysis. Broader impacts will be achieved by integrating into the project training and mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and NSF/NIH CSBSI summer interns in Bioinformatics. International research exchanges in powdery mildew effector prediction (UK) and functional analysis (USA) will enhance the experiences of graduate students and postdocs.  In addition, underrepresented and underserved students in secondary science education will be engaged by partnering with the Des Moines School District to implement a biology classroom module on Gene Expression and Segregation Analysis in agriculture and human health.  Public access to all project data will be fostered through the PLEXdb on-line relational database for gene expression for plants and plant pathogens as well as NCBI-GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  Thus, this project will promote research, education, and dissemination of results to a broad audience, while developing a new generation of agricultural scientists.

379,"ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0955536            PI: Suh, Junghae  ORG: Rice UniversityTitle: CAREER: Encrypted Virus Nanoparticles for Targeted Gene DeliveryINTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Delivering nucleic acid-based therapeutics into target cells specifically is a considerable challenge. Current approaches to achieving targeted gene delivery are limited to modifying the delivery vectors to recognize particular cell surface receptors. Unfortunately, in certain diseases, such as breast cancer, chances of finding a specific cell surface biomarker that identifies all cancer cells are low. Thus, a therapeutic that targets a single cell surface receptor will likely face difficulties in achieving specificity. As a potentially superior alternative approach, the PI proposes to develop innovative virus based gene delivery vectors that are able to compute multiple biomolecular signatures, which in combination are unique to breast cancer, to achieve improved targeting and delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics into breast cancer cells. The virus nanoparticles will be programmed to detect the presence of enzymes misregulated in cancer. A collection of virus nanoparticles encoded with high levels of biomolecular encryption will be developed. The nanoparticles will  unlock  only upon sensing the correct combination of enzymatic inputs preset for identity and intensity. Only successfully unlocked virus capsids will go on to deliver their therapeutic payload into the cell nucleus. Rational and combinatorial design approaches will be used in synergy to engineer virus scaffolds whose bioactivities are actuated by single inputs or by dual inputs under a defined Boolean logic operator. Such sophisticated gene delivery vectors should yield improved therapeutic outcomes. The impact of this research extends far beyond the gene delivery field. The creation of advanced genetically encoded nanoparticles that are able to sense complex stimuli and respond with desired programmed functions can be used as the active components of a number of technologies that already depend on the capabilities of nanoparticles. Nanomaterials able to conduct such complex biomolecular information processing can be very useful for numerous applications, ranging from biomedicine to national defense. This novel technology will enhance the current technical possibilities of nanoscale devices. BROADER IMPACTS:  The PI proposes a highly integrated high school to graduate level training, education, and outreach program centered on educating students about viruses and their exciting place in bionanotechnology. Diversity has been incorporated with care throughout the research and educational plan. The PI will leverage the developed networks of several key organizations, including NSF-funded Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) and Alliances for Graduate Education in the Professoriate (AGEP), to reach large numbers of underrepresented students through lectures, informal lunch meetings, and lab tours and demonstrations. High school and undergraduate students will be exposed to the emerging technologies built from viruses and will be given the opportunity to conduct research in the PIs laboratory. The PI will provide extensive mentorship to students to guide them towards a successful future in science and engineering. Knowledge and inventions derived from the PIs research will be incorporated into a new graduate level course,  Viruses for Bionanotechnology , as well as into the lectures aimed at high school and undergraduate students. Importantly, the PIs graduate students will be trained to become conscientious future mentors aware of the importance of diversity. base; Biological; Biological Markers; Breast Cancer Cell; cancer cell; Capsid; Caring; Cell Nucleus; Cell surface; Cell Surface Receptors; Cells; Collection; combinatorial; Complex; design; Devices; Disease; Education and Outreach; Emerging Technologies; encryption; Engineering; Enzymes; Face; Funding; Future; Gene Delivery; Graduate Education; graduate student; high school; improved; information processing; innovation; Knowledge; Laboratories; lectures; Logic; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; meetings; Mentors; Mentorship; nanobiotechnology; nanomaterials; nanoparticle; nanoscale; Nanotechnology; new technology; Nucleic Acids; Outcome; outreach program; programs; Research; Rice; scaffold; Science; Specificity; Stimulus; Students; targeted delivery; Technology; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Training; Training and Education; Universities; vector; VirusCAREER: ENCRYPTED VIRUS NANOPARTICLES FOR TARGETED GENE DELIVERY",0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
380,"The ability to assess the severity of the biodiversity crisis hinges on addressing the taxonomic impediment -- the serious lack of experts able to identify and classify organisms. This impediment is felt most seriously in the largest groups of animals on earth, the invertebrates, and in particular the mollusks. The primary goal of the project is to assess the diversity and identities of freshwater snails in the family Ampullariidae (apple snails). More than 250 species have been described in this major group of snails, but how many of these are real species, as well as their true identities, is unknown. Knowledge of their diversity and distributions is thus extremely confused and studies of their ecology, behavior, pest status and control are confounded. The project will resolve this confusion by studying the snails' shells, internal anatomy, DNA sequences and behavior. These snails are important components of many ecosystems. One species of apple snail native to the United States is the key food item of the endangered Everglades kite, but introduced invasive apple snails are potentially serious pests in both natural and wetland agricultural (e.g., rice) ecosystems, as well as being potential vectors of parasites that cause disease in humans and animals. Introduced widely in south-east Asia, they have also become the number one pest of rice. Understanding the identities, relationships and origins of these invasive species is thus of great importance. However, the lack of taxonomic expertise in such groups of snails is a serious problem globally, and so a major focus of the project is training of young scientists both in the United States and in South America in order to build this needed expertise, while also providing tools to assist others such as agricultural and customs inspection officials to correctly identify these species.

Keller (Minot State University), Paul J. Overvoorde, Christopher T. Calderone, Rebecca C. Hoye, Keith T. Kuwata, and Kathryn E. Splan (Macalester College).  The ability to quantitatively monitor the dynamics of metabolites in an organism is critical to fully understand the complex interactions of biology's Central Dogma: DNA to RNA to Protein to Metabolite. In part because of the diversity of compounds found in living organisms, especially in plants, the ability to define this critical area in the functional analysis of living plants has been slower to develop than nucleic acid and protein methods. This project addresses impediments to the development of techniques for measuring metabolic dynamics in biological systems. The present limitations include the rather low numbers of compounds that have typically been identified, relatively insensitive procedures that yield insufficient spatial resolution and the dearth of true quantitative methods. The specific aims are: 1) provide improved sample preparation and derivatization methods that yield structural information to create new spectral library resources for metabolite identification by liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), and 2) use stable isotope metabolically labeled plant materials for isotope dilution with robust quantification by LC and GC MS and tandem MS. The work will be focused on rice and tomato, with the expectation that the methods and procedures will be generally applicable to many plant species.Metabolomics as an emerging discipline has yet to realize its full potential for discovery. It is important, therefore, to continue investing in methodological development and access to resources to collect, process and understand metabolomics data. A major component of this project focuses on method development and as such may have its greatest impact by providing educational resources for method implementation. The investigators are strongly committed to recruiting and training people belonging to groups underrepresented in the sciences and attempt to provide undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdocs with a multidisciplinary education in an open minded, diverse and supportive environment. This includes quality mentoring in professional development and research and participation in graduate and postdoctoral programs on the campus. In addition, this proposal will expand the core training in a summer workshop in metabolomics to be held at the University of Minnesota. Interaction with primarily undergraduate institutions will provide access to advanced metabolomic experiences to a wider student population. Short-term dissemination of data, processing algorithms and methods will be accomplished by means of the project website that will be administered and maintained at the University of Minnesota (http://www.metabolomics.umn.edu/).  Metabolite mass spectral libraries will be deposited for long-term access with the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/).

383,"Our mission was to support and establish a formative Center for Children&rsquo;s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research in rural New England. Overall goals of the Center were to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the impact of drinking water and food borne sources of environmental contaminants on children&rsquo;s health, and to strengthen our ties with communities, parents/caregivers and other stakeholders to reduce the risk of environmental threats to children&rsquo;s health.Our formative Center successfully completed its aims to begin: (1) uniting multidisciplinary research teams equipped to identify and address new and emerging children&rsquo;s health issues; (2) engage and mentor promising new investigators (as well as recognized scientists interested in expanding their research) in the investigation of problems related to children&rsquo;s environmental health and disease prevention; and (3) identify and engage potential community collaborators to translate novel and important research findings to key stakeholders, clinicians and the community.Capitalizing upon research and expertise presently underway at Dartmouth, the formative Center comprised an administrative core and four tightly interlinked, and interdisciplinary projects. We designed this formative phase of our Center to maximize our potential for garnering important results, developing a strong team of scientists, clinicians, and public health experts, and supporting an environment that prepared the groundwork for establishing a highly effective, full Center. Our integrated Center was comprised of a talented and diverse team designed to address emerging areas of concern, including the potential for significant exposure to arsenic in infant&#39;s food as well as water. Based on available evidence, these exposures could impact susceptibility to infection and vaccine response and disrupt major pathways involved in human development resulting in birth defects. We have made great strides and unearthed novel insights into the origin of human disease and shed light on places for potential policy change.Project 1: Arsenic and Maternal and Infant Immune Function:The aims of project 1 were to: (1) test the hypothesis that prenatal and early life exposure to arsenic (i.e., via drinking water and food) is associated with an increased risk of infant infections during the first year of life; and (2), to test the hypothesis that arsenic (As) exposure is related to an increased risk of maternal infection during pregnancy. This project extended the work of the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS), an ongoing longitudinal study of women and infants who are residents of New Hampshire/Vermont and who obtain household water from wells, which are potential sources of arsenic exposure. Mother/infant dyads have been recruited into the study and were prospectively followed by interval telephone interviews, and by reviewing prenatal medical records for information on post-partum information on infections, allergies, breast feeding/formula/solid food and other information.Project 2: Food Borne Exposure to Arsenic During the First Year of LifeThis pilot project has contributed to the broader mission of the Dartmouth Center for Children&rsquo;s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research to understand the health effects of low-dose exposure to environmental contaminants, including arsenic, by quantifying sources of arsenic exposure during the first year of life. The public health effects of arsenic in food, especially rice, are only beginning to be evaluated, but are a particularly pressing issue in regions such as New Hampshire where arsenic contamination of private well water is already a concern.

384,"DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The purpose of this training program is to train future scientists to design, implement, select, and evaluate health information technology (HIT) that increases the quality and safety of healthcare. We will achieve this goal by training scientists who can develop and apply human-centered methods and techniques to HIT, drawing from research and methods in human factors engineering, quality improvement, information sciences, and related areas. To prepare scientists to meet this challenge, trainees must intermingle two training experiences. The first gives a solid foundation in informatics, research design and evaluation, human-centered design, and quality improvement. The second offers trainees first-hand experience through research programs that give them the opportunity to put their didactic training to practice by working on HIT that increases safety and quality of care. The program will be managed through the W.M. Keck Center. Trainees may be enrolled at any of the following five Keck Center member universities participating in the proposal: The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, and The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Research opportunities are available at these universities and at several other Texas Medical Center institutions and Centers that have agreed to participate as research sites in the program. These include Memorial Hermann Health Care System, Memorial Hermann TIRR, and the VA Medical Center, among others. Participating Centers include the UT Center for Clinical Translational Science, the UT Medical School Memorial Hermann Center for Healthcare Quality and Safety, the Houston Center for Quality of Care and Utilization Studies, the Center of Inquiry to Improve Outpatient Safety through Effective Electronic Communication, and the UT Center for Health Promotion.

385,"Background:  Blast-induced hearing loss is a common injury sustained by active military personnel and produces a long-term disability that requires chronic management.  However, the treatment of soldiers with blast-induced hearing loss is wholly inadequate.  At present, our ability to design interventions tailored to a patient's injury is frustrated by the inability to visualize the cellular and tissue damage to the ear.  We also lack detailed pathophysiological descriptions of the anatomic, molecular, and genetic changes that occur after blast injury, which are needed to design therapeutic or protective treatments for injured service personnel.This proposal is designed to overcome these limitations and take two parallel and transformative steps forward in our ability to diagnose and treat blast-induced hearing loss.  To provide previously unattainable imaging resolution of the middle and inner ear, we will use optical coherence tomography (OCT).  OCT is a noninvasive, safe method of visualizing living structures on a microscale.  To characterize the pathways of degeneration after blast injury, we will use large-scale gene-chip microarray analysis.  This will permit us to determine which genes within the cochlea are up- and downregulated, and which may exacerbate damage following the initial blast injury.  We will apply these two approaches to a novel animal model of blast injury developed in our labs.Objective/Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that (1) improved imaging of the ear correlated with (2) a detailed understanding of the tissue, cellular, and genetic changes that occur within the ear after blast injury will allow us to develop novel and effective diagnoses and treatments.Specific Aims: (1)  To develop an endoscopic OCT device to image the ear at high resolution.  (2)  To characterize tissue, cellular, and genetic changes that occur within the ear after blast injury.Study Design:    Subaim 1a:  We will characterize the anatomic and physiologic patterns of damage that occur after blast injury in mice using our existing OCT experimental setup.  This subaim will provide the basis for understanding the pathophysiology that occurs in soldiers sustaining this type of injury.Subaim 1b:  We will develop a portable OCT device to image the middle and inner ear in humans at high resolution using miniature endoscopic technology with tunable focusing.  This subaim will result in a device ready to be tested in humans that will permit the clinician to specifically define the damage that has occurred in a soldier who has sustained a blast injury.Subaim 2a:  We will perform histological and gene expression analyses on the inner ears of mice exposed to blast trauma or noise exposure, and correlate these changes with the functional and structural data obtained from our OCT studies in Aim 1a.  This subaim will identify molecular pathways of degeneration that can be targeted by drugs to reduce the severity of the blast-induced ear injury.Subaim 2b:  We will use the findings of subaim 2a to test existing and novel drugs for blast-induced hearing loss in mice.  The goal is to test candidate drugs in preparation for clinical trials in humans.  To accomplish these goals, we have put together a collaborative research team of faculty from Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, and Texas A&M University.  This team includes a clinician-scientist with expertise in human hearing loss, ear surgery, and auditory physiology, two bioengineers with expertise in miniature optics, mechanics and imaging, and two neuroscientists with expertise in inner ear neurobiology, gene regulation, and traumatic brain injury.Impact:  This project will result in (1) a comprehensive understanding of the anatomic, molecular, genetic, and functional consequences of blast injury to the ear, (2) the identification and testing of novel therapeutics for blast-induced hearing loss, and (3) the development of a new endoscopic OCT imaging device to image the human ear.  The ultimate goal of this research is for a clinician to be able to use the OCT imaging device to assess the ear injury that a soldier has sustained, and then to implement the correct therapy for it based upon firm scientific evidence.Project:  Rehabilitation; Task: Restoration and Rehabilitation of Sensory System Traumatic Injury.

386,"Cereals provide a substantial proportion of daily calories for infants, children and women in developing and industrialized nations. When consumed in common serving sizes, the density of essential micronutrients such as iron and zinc in cereal foods is insufficient to prevent deficiencies and more chronic illness in these populations. In addition, bioavailability of these micronutrients can be severely hampered by high concentrations of co-occurring inhibitory food components, or anti-nutrients. Cereal crops have the capacity to accumulate high levels of iron/zinc in vegetative tissues, but this increase is not mirrored by grain iron/zinc accumulation, suggesting the existence of physiological or biochemical barriers to the transport and deposition of iron/zinc in grains. Micronutrient accumulation in grains is a complex trait, resulting from the integration of various physiological processes across several plant tissues over the duration of a growth season. Since we have an incomplete understanding of how such nutrients enter these tissues, our investigation aims to isolate and identify genetic factors controlling iron/zinc delivery from vegetative tissues to rice grains. We will also study how well these nutrients can be absorbed from rice as a food. To identify these genetic controls, we will evaluate a set of select traits in 200 genetically distinct rice cultivars. Data will be used to search for genes associated with seed nutrition. The results will help guide future breeding efforts to produce more nutritious cultivars.

387,"Plants have the ability to detect a wide range of different environmental cues and adapt their metabolism to maximize survival and reproduction. Small molecules called hormones are responsible for the movement of this signal from the cue sensing cells to the entire plant system. These hormones play a role in almost every pathway in the plant. The hormone pathways involved in disease resistance, drought resistance, growth, and seed development have been the most studied in the hopes of creating better crop plants. The activity of any hormone is dependent on the amount present in the plant and whether any molecules (such as sugars or amino acids) are attached to the hormone. This allows the plant to tightly regulate the activity of any hormone through multiple methods. The GH3 family of enzymes is responsible for attaching amino acids to a variety of different hormones. GH3-mediated conjugation can lead to activation, inactivated storage, or degradation of the hormone. So far, only a few GH3 proteins have been studied and their hormone-amino acid preference determined. This project aims to study how the GH3 proteins recognize their hormone and amino acid substrates and how GH3 sequence leads to the hormone-amino acid preference. Understanding the role between GH3 sequence and function will allow the extrapolation of GH3 function to unstudied GH3 proteins in sequenced crop plants and help lay the groundwork for future studies in these crop plants.

388,"Rice is the staple food for over half of the world's population. It is a poor source for protein, iron, vitamin E and lipids, leading to severe health problems in developing countries where rice is the staple. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes regulate gene expression by modifying the position and structure of nucleosomes, the basic structural and functional unit of chromatin, and consequently the accessibility to DNA by cellular molecules, such as transcription apparatus. Seed storage nutrients are specifically synthesized in seeds only. Current studies have shown that chromatin remodeling is essential in controlling tissue specific expression of grain filling genes. Purifying and characterizing these chromatin remodeling complexes and identifying genes subject to the regulation of remodeling complexes will advance our understanding of the general mechanism of chromatin mediated gene regulation and shed new light on the regulatory mechanisms of cereal grain filling.

389,"With plentiful rainfall, abundant land, and mild winters, the U.S. Gulf Coast is among the geographic regions with the highest potential for production of dedicated cellulosic bioenergy crops, especially energy cane and high biomass sorghum. The two most destructive crop pests in the region are Mexican rice borer and sugarcane borer, which also attack graminaceous bioenergy crops. Other threatening pests include root knot and lesion nematodes, and the sugarcane aphid, which transmits sugarcane yellow leaf virus. The expected large-scale production of bioenergy crops will significantly impact the abundance of different plant inhabiting insects and diseases, and will require modification of existing pest management programs. The overall goal of this research is to build a landscape-wide pest management program that will mitigate insect pest and disease pressures and damage to bioenergy crops in interaction with conventional crops in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Critical data on the biological, ecological, and economic impact of major pests and diseases will be obtained through the proposed research. Program activities include landscape-wide plant and pest phenological surveys, multi-crop field and greenhouse bionomics experiments, and pest density/yield response studies. The results will be integrated into an analysis and forecast system that provides the capability to identify optimal pest management strategies. By enhancing bioenergy and conventional cropping system compatibility, the program will help achieve goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. As part of the on-going Sun Grant Regional Biomass energy system, Co-PDs are already developing energy canes for cellulosic production.

390,"Epigenetic regulation refers to hereditary types of gene regulation that do not alter DNA sequences but do change the activity or expression of genes. In plants, epigenetic regulation is thought to influence many biological processes including the responses to environmental stresses. Among the latter, drought stress often poses the greatest limitation for agricultural crop productivity. This project will investigate epigenetic regulation in response to drought in rice by examining the RNA changes and chromatin modifications associated with epigenetic control. Fulfilling our objectives should identify genes, chromosomal locations, and mechanisms that, together with molecular breeding efforts and biotechnological approaches, could expedite the development of drought-adapted rice varieties.

391,"Production of fuels from dedicated perennial grass crops has potential to decrease dependence on oil imports and release of climate-changing greenhouse gasses. Switchgrass is among the most promising grasses for large-scale production of biofuel feedstocks. Because dedicated biofuel crops will need to be grown on large scales, with minimal inputs on marginal land over many years, it will be necessary to utilize genetically improved varieties that can withstand diverse stresses, such as attack by pathogens, a major constraint to crop production in the US and globally. Switchgrass stands will normally remain in production for periods of 10 to more than 20 years and failure to plant a high yielding, disease resistant cultivar may cost a producer substantially during the life of the stand (Hopkins et al, 1995). Our goal is to generate the basic genomics knowledge on switchgrass that is needed for future engineering and marker assisted breeding of improved switchgrass varieties that are disease resistant. We will also identify and characterized key genes involved in the grass defense response using the computational and proteomics tools already developed for rice and then validate the function of individual genes for disease resistance in switchgrass.

392,"Crop productivity is directly related to photosynthetic activity integrate across a growing season. In multicellular plants, leaves function as the primary site of photosynthesis. Fruits and storage organs we harvest must import products of photosynthesis through the plant's vascular system to support growth. This is similar to humans absorbing nutrients from digestion in their small intestine, and circulating those nutrients in their vascular system to feed their extremities. In these experiments, we will use a molecular genetic approach to enhance the capacity of the plant's vascular system to move sugars produced in photosynthesis to the import dependent fruit and storage organs of rice and sugar beet. We predict this will stimulate photosynthetic activity in the leaf leading to enhanced yield. Increased crop yield would benefit society with a more abundant food supply and increased availability of biomass for fiber and fuel.

393,"Plant hormones such as cytokinin influence virtually every aspect of growth and development. Deciphering the mechanism of action of these hormones is a central question in plant biology. Remarkable progress has been made recently in our understanding of cytokinin biosynthesis, metabolism and signaling, primarily from studies in Arabidopsis. A model for cytokinin signaling has emerged that is similar to ubiquitous signaling systems in bacteria called phosphorelays. While all the elements comprising the cytokinin-responsive phosphorelay are found in rice and other monocots, relatively little is known regarding their function. We will analyze the role of these phosphorelay genes in rice using a variety of complementary approaches, including determining their pattern of expression, the effect of disruption of these genes on the growth and development of rice and on cytokinin signaling, and finally we will screen for outputs of this pathway. These studies should greatly increase our understanding of cytokinin signaling in rice, and by inference in other moncots. As cytokinin regulates many aspects of growth and development that impact agrinomically important traits such as grain yield, root and shoot growth, sink/source relationships, nutrient acquisition, leaf senescence, nodulation, and pathogen interactions, a better understanding of cytokinin function in rice and other monocots has significant potential to lead a broad range of improvements in crop species.&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194; Anabolism; Arabidopsis; Bacteria; Biology; Cereals; Cytokinins; Elements; Genes; Growth; Growth and Development function; Hormones; Indium; Lead; Metabolism; Modeling; Nutrient; Output; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Plants; Rice; Role; senescence; Signal Transduction; Source; System; traitROLE OF TWO-COMPONENT ELEMENTS IN CYTOKININ SIGNALING IN RICE",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,0.9986223823532783,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
394,"The proposal is designed to (a) improve grain yield and biomass in rice, (b) modify lignin biosynthesis for biofuel production in rice, and (c) understand the mechanism of disease resistance in common bean. We will use the novel terminator-less (TL)sense transgene constructs for silencing/down-regulating genes such as HOG1 (homologydependent gene silencing 1) that exhibit high affinity cytokinin binding activity, for improving grain yield and biomass in rice. In Arabidopsis, silencing of HOG1 has resulted in significant increase in yield and biomass. We will also use TL constructs for down-regulation of lignin biosynthetic genes, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), hydroxycinnamoyl CoA: shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) and coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3'H) to decrease lignin content in rice. Further, we will use TL constructs to understand the mechanism of rust resistance in common bean. Two loci, Ur-3 and Crg, are known to provide resistance to rust. Silencing of Ur-3 and Crg sequences through TL construct will shed light on the much needed mechanism of rust resistance in common bean. The project will lead to: 1) improved grain yield and biomass in rice, 2) reduced lignin in rice straw for biofuel, 3) better understanding of rust resistance in common bean, 4) trained undergraduate/graduate minority students in biotechnology, 4) establishment of collaboration between UAPB and other institutions, and 5) strengthened research and teaching capacity of UAPB.

395,"Enrollment at WETCC can support only one full-time instructor for the ES Program. A well-rounded program requires coverage of such diverse topics as aquatic science, astronomy, botany, geology, meteorology, mycology, ornithology, soil science, wildlife biology, and the management of the above. The current instructor brought many of these skills to the college and has since expanded his skill set, but deficiencies remain. Two are major components of the ecology of the region, namely mycology and aquatic science. Mycology was chosen as a critical need because fungi are a keystone species within the soils of the forest biomes which dominate much of the White Earth Reservation. In fact, research indicates that a forest cannot exist without the proper mix and abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. There is also research that indicates fungi are an effective tool for protecting and managing forests, and for bioremediation of wastes and the protection of water resources. These latter subjects represent important management and entrepreneurial opportunities for our students. For these reasons, a thorough introduction to mycology would be a valuable addition to the ES program. Another dominant feature of the Reservation ecology is water. Water resources are of particular concern to the Anishinaabeg because two of their most important traditional foods, fish and wild rice, live in the aquatic environment. Furthermore, much of the local economy depends directly or indirectly on water. Agriculture, recreation, real estate, harvest of wild rice and bait leeches, tourism, among others, are all impacted by water quality and management. The majority of WETCC students indicate that they want to stay on the Reservation after graduation and use their education to help their families and communities. The ES students, in particular, all indicate a desire to work in natural resource management fields on the Reservation. Such a career is hard to imagine without a background in aquatic sciences. For all of the above reasons the fields of mycology and aquatic science were determined to be the most pressing need for improvement within the ES curriculum. This effort will require professional development for the instructor, in addition to curriculum development and procurement of instructional materials.

396,"The United States particularly through DOE and USDA has very strong and often integrated programs targeting the development of new energy sources (e.g. biofuels, wind energy, geothermal, etc) and improvements to sustainable energy sources especially solar power. Billions of dollars have been invested in diverse programs. In contrast, similar integrated efforts at similar scales directed towards new approaches to energy conservation (aside from lighting) have not received the same emphasis despite the fact that this should be of equal National importance. The byproducts of biofuels and direct burning processes (of agricultural wastes for example) will always contain a major inorganic fraction likely to be primarily silica because plants selectively extract and concentrate silica from the environment excluding heavy metals. Thus, the resulting silica is relatively pure compared with natural silica sources (e.g. sand), amorphous and high surface area allowing it to be chemically extracted at low temperatures with minimal costs. Mayaterials' researchers have developed a low temperature, green and inexpensive process to extract this silica from agricultural wastes, rice hull ash in particular. Using the various products of this process, Mayaterials is proposing to develop a new type of inexpensive vacuum insulation panels (VIPs). The use of VIPs in refrigeration and housing is currently limited in the USA due to their very high cost. By using agricultural waste as the raw ingredient and getting rid of the complex and expensive processes currently used to make good quality VIPs, Mayaterials plans to decrease the cost of VIPs several fold.

397,"The Arkansas EIPM-CS COORDINATION Program continues on a history of successful delivery of IPM programming to agricultural constituents statewide. Critical needs of IPM in Arkansas include reducing the impacts of diseases, insects and weeds; adopting tactics to delay development of resistance to pesticides; and demonstrating the economic benefits of integrated methods to combat pests, weeds and diseases. This EIPM-CS Coordination proposal includes the Emphasis Areas of Agronomic Crops, Animal Agriculture, Consumer/Urban IPM, Specialty Crops, School IPM and Wide-Area Pest Monitoring and Reporting. Commodities included in the IPM program include rice, soybean, corn, cotton, fruit, and cattle; we also will deliver programming on fire ants to urban constituents and IPM to Master Gardeners, and on IPM to school administrators. The proposed project is based largely on the recent success we have had in delivering locally based IPM demonstrations through a competitive county-level mini-grants program approximately 50 percent of the proposed funding is dedicated to the mini-grants program. In addition to the county-based program, we also will participate in the national ipmPIPE program, with monitoring and disseminating information about Asian soybean rust. The EIPM-CS Coordination Program in Arkansas is essential to build on past successes, and to increase acceptance and incorporation of IPM to improve economic returns for growers and reduce the impacts of agricultural production on the environment.

398,"Apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata), a highly invasive pest affecting wetland crops in 18 countries including the U.S., is listed as one of the 100 Worst Global Invaders. One study showed that due to its voracious appetite, present value damage from the snail could cost Philippine rice production as much as 2.3 billion dollars annually. In Hawai`i, the apple snail invasion has reduced taro harvests for the small and mid-sized farms that comprise the local taro industry by 18% to 25% annually. This project will research a unique control for apple snail on Hawai`i's wetland taro production using the unrefined glycerin co-product from biodiesel production as an agricultural amendment. The research will identify potential active compounds in the glycerin co-product, establish the LC-50 for the amendment, provide an initial assessment of water quality based on residual compounds, and identify the range of variability in the glycerin co-product from different sources of biodiesel feedstock. Results will be used to establish protocols for field testing the product on wetland taro in Hawai`i. The end goal will be to develop a marketable product that provides environmentally safe control of apple snail on taro and enhances the efficiency and profitability of small taro farms. Locally manufacturing an agricultural amendment for use in Hawaiian taro production saves energy through import substitution. Developing value-added co-products from biodiesel refining will improve profitability for the renewable fuels industry. Sustaining and increasing wetland taro production will revitalize rural areas and preserve wetland habitat. Developing a natural organic compound that effectively controls this invasive pest will preserve water quality in streams and coastal waters and has potential applications for wetland rice production and preservation of wetlands globally.

399,"Dysphagia is a disruption in the normal ability to chew and swallow food and drink beverages. This condition is commonly caused by stroke, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, or radiation therapy due to cancer. For those with medical conditions that cause dysphagia, they are unable to break down, manipulate, collect, and swallow the food that is in their mouth. For most of these patients, all food items must be pureed into a  pudding  or  mashed potato  consistency to avoid choking hazards, defined by the American Dietetic Association as Level 1 Puree. Unfortunately, the physical and chemical effects of pureeing food causes flavor, texture, and other changes that make the food less appetizing and, therefore, less likely to be consumed. These effects on an individual's appetite can have adverse consequences on the medically fragile patient who suffers from dysphagia. Current scratch recipes and available products from manufacturers are of marginal acceptability. No company has yet effectively addressed this unmet need. Rubicon's Simply Puree Proteins will feature the following: Improved flavor and aesthetic characteristics Safe texture High nutrient, lower mass density Solving the Retort/Flavor Challenge Shelf-stable formulation Affordable pricing Meeting or exceeding these featured requirements will translate into a growing, profitable product line that has the following expected benefits: Expected Benefits It is anticipated that these improved characteristics will greatly enhance normal food consumption by patients with Dysphagia. This will decrease their risk of choking and aspiration pneumonia, as well as improve their nutritional intake, thereby improving their resistance to infection and other diseases. Increased normal food consumption will also reduce reliance on supplemental nutrition, thereby reducing cost pressures on facility budgets. Methodology Rubicon's food science professionals will be working with two strategic partners, Park 100 Foods and Ameriqual, and leverage their know-how and technology to address this unmet need. Phase 1 development will begin on a pork-based protein. Park 100 has expertise in pureeing food, while Ameriqual has strengths in the retort manufacturing process, two important aspects of this development. A product formulation will be created that will then be tested under conditions similar to what will be experienced in a full production environment and then a food service kitchen. Nursing home customers that have expressed a strong desire for a similar product will then have an opportunity to provide critical feedback. Upon successful completion, phase 2 development will proceed to finish a complete line of meat proteins ready for commercialization. Rubicon Foods has successfully introduced puree carbohydrates, such as puree breads, pasta, and rice to the nursing home industry. They intend to leverage this customer base and logistical channel to offer these complementary products to the market.

403,"The California peach, nectarine, and plum industry has seen demand increasing in the domestic as well as overseas markets for flavorful fresh fruit. Thus, the production and marketing of fresh stone fruits has increased rapidly. However, despite all of the information on the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables, consumption is low for peaches, nectarines and plums at approximately 2.0, 4.5, and 2.5 pounds of fruit per capita, and has even been decreasing in the last decade. This has led us to evaluate the potential for improving the consumer quality by selecting new flavorful cultivars, advancing the maturity, and developing postharvest technologies to express consumer quality and/or protect flavor during handling of fruits packed in large volume operations. During our last 12 years, we learned that the loss of flavor quality due to ?off flavor? development and changes in texture due to chilling injury during postharvest handling are very important in explaining the low consumer acceptance. Due to globalization, high local production, and a slow market, ?sensory damaged? fruit which reduce consumption are available in the market and compete with sound commodities. A recent intensive consumer quality survey (1,552 consumers) indicated that lack of taste (?sensory damaged?), softening, and spoilage are the main barriers restricting California peach, nectarine and plum purchasing in the USA market (Sterling-Rice Group, 2006). Since major sensory quality problems (softening and unfavorable taste or lack of taste) occur during postharvest handling, the production and delivery of flavorful fruit, and prevention of these postharvest quality losses during the cold chain, could be an approach to improve tree fruit consumption. Traditionally, postharvest physiologists have focused on harvest maturity as their starting point; many ?orchard factors? profoundly influence the postharvest performance of the fruit. For these reasons, our research also included investigating how orchard factors influence stone fruit postharvest quality, storage and handling performance, and consumer preferences.

404,"Breast-fed infants have fewer infections and a better immune system when they are young and less obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease later in life than infants fed infant formula. Most of these differences are believed to be due to bioactive proteins present in breast milk, but not in formula. Selected breast milk proteins can now be made by putting their genes into crops like rice, which is produced in large quantities in California. A California biotech company has already expressed two breast milk proteins in rice in large quantities, and when these proteins were added to a water solution and given to children with diarrhea, it shortened the duration of diarrhea and prevented it from coming back. We will identify more proteins in breast milk by novel methods and characterize there activities. The proteins with functions most valuable for infants and young children will first be produced in small scale in the laboratory and their bioactivities will be confirmed by known test systems using human intestinal cells. The possibility of expressing the identified key proteins in large scale in rice will be explored in communication with the California biotech industry. In its extension, the possibility of incorporating these proteins into improved formulas for preterm and term infants, and into novel infant foods will be explored with the California biotech industry, formula companies, state WIC representatives as well as health care professionals and other stakeholders.

The seedlings are derived from true seed obtained from different polycross and paired-cross breeding nurseries, each having a different breeding objective. Sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas, is the seventh most important crop in the world with more than 136 million metric tons produced annually. In developing countries, sweetpotato ranks fifth in importance for its caloric contribution and in acreage cultivated after rice, wheat, maize and cassava. In the United States, sweetpotato is an important specialty crop. During 2004-2008, approximately 97,400 acres were planted annually generating $317.8 million in farm-gate revenue. The number of acres produced has remained relatively stable over the last 10 years, with a slight trend upward in the last three. NC produces roughly 40-45% of the U.S. crop. During 2003-2008, an average of 42,500 acres of sweetpotatoes were planted yearly by NC farmers with farm-gate receipts averaging $107.5 million annually making it the most important vegetable crop produced in the state. About 60% of the U.S. crop is marketed fresh and the remainder is processed by various food processors. In terms of total sales, pureed sweetpotatoes are one of the leading vegetable baby food products sold by food processors in the US, but processors are also marketing them as valued-added canned products, and as sweetpotato chips and french fries in addition to other processed and prepared products. In addition to their utility as a food product, there is great potential for the production of value-added, bio-based renewable resources such as biofuels and sugar-based chemicals from the starch in sweetpotato because the crop is easy to grow and produces high yields per unit area with minimal fertilizer inputs.

411,"The world's population is estimated to reach 9 billion by the first half of this century and the demand for food, fiber and feed will nearly double. More food croplands will be used for bioenergy production and there will be limited rural dwellers and even fewer farmers. The biggest challenge will be increasing food production from less land and farmers. Rice is the staple food for over half of the world's population and accounts for 30-65% of the calorie consumption of nearly more than 3 billion people. Being not a staple food, U.S. grown rice is being exported to rice consuming countries of the world. Improving grain yield has been the focus in rice breeding and genetics programs. There is a significant progress in the development of super rice and super hybrid rice as yields of more than 12 tons per hectare were reported. However, these are still rare and with narrow adaptability. Yield stability is still low, yield advantage of hybrid rice is not fully elucidated, and the breeding for high yield is still a big challenge. Land races are beneficial in increasing yield and promoting diversity but genebank collections are not fully utilized. Natural variations in these collections represent huge untapped resources for breeding and gene discovery. The success of breeding strategies depends on the genetic diversity and this could be found in genebanks. Grain quality of rice is critical as it dictates the market value and the adoption of the cultivar. However, similar to yield and yield related traits, predictable grain quality traits such as milling traits, sensory and cooking quality are difficult to select in breeding programs. The advances in rice genomics created opportunities for the application of DNA markers in breeding and genetics. We will be developing new and more effective markers for predicting rice quality. Gene discovery and understanding the genetic mechanism for a trait are equally important in breeding for high yield and quality improvement. These are continuing activities that will help breeders in developing high quality cultivars. The project aims to identify and develop germplasm to further increase yield, and improve grain quality, and develop strategies that will enhance efficiency of conventional breeding in cultivar release. Studies related to inheritance, mapping and DNA marker development for important traits such as agronomic traits, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and tolerance to herbicides will be conducted and the available germplasm and new technology in the development of improved breeding line for cultivar release and/or parents in hybridization program will be used. These will generate important breeding and genetics information that will provide guidance in breeding for high yield and excellent quality rice.

413,"ROP GTPases (guanine nucleotide binding proteins) cycle between the active (on) and inactive (off) forms and thus act as master molecular switches to control the passage of various extracellular signals to influence plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic environments. Our long-term goal is to manipulate ROP GTPase signaling genes to improve crop productivity or quality such as nitrogen use efficiency, cellulose synthesis, disease resistance, tolerance to various abiotic stresses such as low oxygen, drought and nutrient imbalance, pollination, development of roots and root hairs, leaf morphogenesis, and responses to plant growth hormones such as auxin and ABA. Our studies suggest that ROP GTPase is turned on by RopGEFs (ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and cell surface kinase receptors (named RLKs) that sense extracellular signals and activate RopGEFs. Activated ROPs then pass the signal to their target proteins called RICs to generate specific outputs (such as increased cellulose synthesis and nitrogen use efficiency). The model plant Arabidopsis and the model crop plant rice both contain a large number of RLKs, RopGEFs, and RICs). The specific objectives of this renewal project are 1) to determine the function of all 14 RopGEFs and 11 RICs in Arabidopsis using T-DNA insertional knockout mutants or RNAi methods, 2) to elucidate the ROP signaling pathways that control nitrogen use efficiency and cellulose synthesis in Arabidopsis by determining functional interactions between specific ROPs, RICs, RopGEFs and RLKs that regulate these two processes in Arabidopsis, 3) to translate the knowledge learned in Arabidospis into rice by generating transgenic rice plants expressing wild type or mutant forms of specific RICs, RopGEFs, and RLKs that affect these two processes. We expect that we will have important new insights into how Rop GTPase signaling regulates nitrogen metabolism and cellulose synthesis in plants, and importantly will develop transgenic methods for improving nitrogen use efficiency and cellulose synthesis for biofuel production.

414,"Potato is the third most important food crop in the world, next only to rice and wheat. Late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, is the most devastating potato disease worldwide. The first shock of devastation caused by P. infestans was the well-known Irish Potato Famine, which led to the death of approximately one million people through starvation and disease, with another million thought to have emigrated as a result of the famine. Control of late blight in the United States relies almost exclusively on fungicide application. During an average epidemic year the fungicide cost to control late blight is about $200-300 per acre. Extensive fungicide applications can also result in a major environmental issue. Potatoes contain many resistance genes (R genes) against late blight. At least 11 race-specific late blight resistance genes, all from a wild potato species Solanum demissum, have been incorporated into numerous potato varieties. However, all of these genes have already been overcome by specific P. infestans strains. Because the race-specific resistance genes have been short-lived in breeding practices, it is of great interest to study the mechanisms of broad-spectrum, or race-non-specific disease resistances against late blight. We have cloned such a race-non-specific late blight resistance gene, named RB, from a Mexican wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum in 2003. Transgenic potato lines containing the RB gene showed resistance against various P. infestans strains. Most remarkably, the transgenic lines exhibited a high level of resistance in the Toluca Valley in Mexico, which is the most late blight infested region in the world. The proposed research will investigate the molecular mechanisms of the RB-mediated resistance pathway. We are interested why and how the RB-mediated resistance is different from the resistance conferred by the race-specific resistance gene. Using genomics mythologies we have identified a set of 185 genes that are associated with the RB-mediated resistance. Most importantly, we have discovered a novel receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene, which may play a key role in the resistance pathway. We will use several different techniques, including gene expression, gene silencing, and late blight inoculation tests in greenhouse, to study the specific role of this RLK gene. Results from the proposed research will be important to develop strategies for breeding and deploying the RB gene in sustainable ways.

415,"Abscisic acid is a key hormone mediating plant responses to environmental stresses. It is well known that abscisic acid stimulates stomatal closure and thus supports water conservation by plants during drought. The abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure could also lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide uptake by leaves via stomata thus affect photosynthesis. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that abscisic acid can reduce photosynthetic capacity of leaves by some mechanism other than the stomatal effect. It has been shown in several plant species that some abscisic acid-regulated processes are mediated by abscisic acid-activated protein kinases. In this project, we aim to investigate the role of abscisic acid-activated protein kinases in regulation of photosynthetic processes using knockout and/or knockdown lines of abscisic acid-activated protein kinases in Arabidopsis and rice. Because the reduction in photosynthesis by environmental stresses is a major impediment to crop yield, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of abscisic acid action may facilitate the breeding of new crop varieties with improved performance under environmental stresses. The expected outcomes from this project include strengthened interaction with other investigators, professional collaboration, and scientific publications.

416,"Filamentous ascomycete fungi are the major cause of diseases of crop plants, including both pre-harvest diseases, such as rice blast caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, or the ubiqitous root pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum and post-harvest rots, caused for example, by Botryis cinerea and Aspergillus niger. In addition filamentous ascomycete also cause serious and often fatal diseases in humans, for example, Valley Fever, caused by Coccidioides immitis, and in immunocompromised patients, such as Aspergillosis, caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus. New compounds to combat fungal diseases, especially in humans and animals, often have very toxic side effects, because they are not generally not specific in their action. We have characterized a pathway that induces cell death in filamentous ascomycete fungi, called heterokaryon incompatibility (HI) that they use in nature to combat infection by mycoviruses; HI is a type of fungal  immune system . We have identified a number of proteins that are required for induction of fungal death; these proteins are only found in the genomes of filamentous ascomycete fungi and are absent in plants, humans and animals. These include a fungal-specific transcription factor, Vib-1 and its putative targets, the HET domain proteins. However, it is not clear how Vib-1 mediates death, nor the role of the HET domain proteins in this process. This proposal aims to dissect the direct transcriptional target of Vib-1 and to identify proteins that physically interact with the HET domain proteins, to characterize fully the pathway of HI-induced cell death. The characterization of this pathway may led to the indentification of critical components that we could use as targets for induction of the death pathway in a large number of filamentous fungi, thus convincing to organism to  kill thyself .

417,"Cereal crops represents over 60% of the world's food supply. Rice (Oryza sativa) alone serves as the staple food for over half of the world's population. In milled rice, the content of protein, iron, vitamin E and lipids is low compared with other cereals, contributing to nutrition deficiency in many developing counties where rice is staple food. The consumption of rice in US increased by 250% from 1965 to 2007and USA is the largest rice exporting country outside of Asia. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve rice nutrient quality for both economic and human health reasons. Although extensively explored, due to the complexity of the subject, the improvement in rice nutrient quality is still very limited. Recently, we generated a collection of rice mutants in epigenetic regulatory pathways. We detected desirable protein content increase in milled rice in two mutants, which displayed little change in plant morphology and seed development. Our results suggest that manipulation of the epigenetic pathways holds great promise for improving nutrition quality in milled rice without comprising the yield and other agronmic traits. In this project, we propose to investigate the potential of improving rice grain quality in cultivars currently grown by farmers via genetic manipulation of epigenetic pathway genes.Our research not only have a high potential of generating desired transgenic rice with improved nutrient quality but also open a new avenue for the improvement of seed nutrients.

418,"Diabetes in Hawai'i affects over 20% of the population aged 65-74 yrs and 7% of the total population. The prevalence of diabetes in Hawai'i is higher than the national average and is an immediate health concern. Diabetes is associated with the presence of obesity. Current efforts to promote weight loss in the United States have slowed the obesity trend, but the prevalence of obesity in both children and adults has not decreased. Choosing foods that are high in dietary fiber aids in weight loss and also improves blood glucose control. Rice is a predominant carbohydrate source in Hawai'i and throughout the world. Dietary fiber content (as measured by resistant starch) of rice varies with rice variety and cooking method. The aims of this study are to (1) quantify the resistant starch content of rice varieties commonly available in Hawai'i to augment current nutrient databases such as the USDA National Nutrient Database, (2) characterize the fermentability of rice-derived resistant starch to better understand the mechanisms driving the health benefits of resistant starch, (3) assess the glycemic and satiety effects of various varieties and preparations of rice for the development of a diabetes prevention program and weight loss protocol, and (4) develop a website to educate the consumer about health benefits of dietary fiber and emphasize local, high-fiber foods. This project will provide the foundation for future research grants, as well as benefit the consumer in Hawai'i and the United States by clarifying the importance of dietary fiber.

419,"International trade and competitive impacts stemming from changes in domestic agricultural and economic policies, combined with continued reforms in trade treaties and agreements, will be major factors influencing the continued competitiveness of the Southern agricultural sector. The Southern region is an important contributor to U.S. agricultural production, processing and exports. The region is the major supplier of poultry, vegetables, cotton, peanuts, tobacco, cane sugar, rice, and citrus fruits and an important contributor to the production of grains, soybeans, feeder cattle, poultry, pork and dairy products. Addressing these issues is important for agricultural producers, policymakers, farm organization leaders, agribusiness firms, rural communities, and related constituencies in order for them to have the information necessary for informed decision making and policy design. The outcome of this research project is expected to have positive consequences for several groups associated with Southern agriculture. First, through the work of this project; producers and agribusinesses would have timely, reliable information on which to base crucial economic decisions. Second, policymakers would have access to information from this project upon which to base important domestic and trade policy decisions. In addition, the improved competitiveness of the southern agricultural industry is expected from the availability of research results and recommendations which are expected to strengthen the employment base and consequently to increase the income levels in the Southern States. Additional outputs from this project are journal articles, books and book chapters, professional papers, and conferences organized.

420,"Rice diseases pose a threat to rice production. Sheath blight, blast, and Cercospora are among the most important diseases of rice in Texas. Bacterial panicle blight also has the potential threat to Texas rice production. These diseases cause a significant reduction in yield and quality that costs producers millions of dollars each year. The practical solution to these problems is to develop an effective integrated disease management program by using host resistance, fungicides, biocontrol and cultural practices. Disease resistance is the best option to manage these diseases. Therefore, a new disease resistance screening program will be developed by establishing three disease nurseries located in major rice production areas in Texas. These nurseries will increase our ability to screen for resistance to the major diseases. Best timing and rate and appropriate economic thresholds of fungicide applications will be evaluated and developed by conducting multi-location fungicide trials and establishing the disease-yield loss relationships under different environments. To improve efficacy of fungicides, a weather-based disease forecast will be developed for rice diseases with a focus on Cercospora. In addition, a novel cultural practice using brassica biofumigant cover crops for suppression of sheath blight and utilizing beneficial bacteria for biocontrol of sheath blight and bacterial panicle blight also will be developed in order to enhance the economic and environmental benefits of this integrated management program. The results and information from this research will be effectively delivered to Texas rice producers and other clientele through our ongoing outreach activities.

421,"1. THE EVOLUTION OF WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN THE PLANT KINGDOM WRKY transcription factors are one of the largest and most important families of plant transcription factors. They are of ancient origin but are completely absent from yeast and animal lineages. In higher plants, the majority of these members are key regulators of important stress responses such as the responses to drought, wounding and pathogens. Lower plants contain less WRKY genes and certain subgroups are missing. I aim to discover the roles of WRKY transcription factors in mosses and algae, as well as higher plants and thereby shed new light on the function of this important family of transcription factors across the entire plant kingdom. 2. PLANT PROMOTERS FOR USE IN BASIC RESEARCH AND PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY For many strategies aimed at improving crop plants using transgenes, the stumbling block is not what gene or genes to express but rather how to express it. The right gene will not improve crop performance if it is not expressed in the right way. Being able to express genes in the desired way requires a collection of different promoter regions that can be used to turn a gene on and off when and where expression of the gene is required. Large collections of suitable promoters that direct gene expression in the desired way (for example drought, cold or pathogen inducible) are lacking and this project looks to provide useful promoters for both plant biotechnology and basic plant research. 3. BRACHYPODIUM DISTACHYON AS A MODEL SYSTEM TO STUDY COLD AND DROUGHT-INDUCED GENES IN GRASSES Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is poised to become to monocot crops what Arabidopsis is to dicots - the model system for gene discovery. The JGI describes it as the new model plant for temperate grasses and herbaceous energy crops. This project aims to isolate genes that regulate drought and cold responses in Brachypodium. These genes will then be used to dissect the processes of drought tolerance and cold hardiness. The ultimate goal of the project is to use Brachpodium as a model system for wheat as this should bypass the technical problems associated with wheat and lead to new strategies for wheat improvement. 4. WRKY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AS TOOLS TO IMPROVE DROUGHT RESPONSES Drought is the major culprit behind crop losses worldwide, with billion dollar losses in the USA. WRKY transcription factors are key regulators of many plant stress responses but until recently, there was little evidence linking WRKYs with drought responses. We now know that many WRKY genes are induced by drought. We have identified this as a major gap in our knowledge and an opportunity to increase drought tolerance. Our hypothesis is that WRKYs are regulators of water stress responses and that similar genes regulate these responses in different plant species. Our goal is to identify WRKY genes that regulate drought responses in rice and soybean and develop a tool to identify similar genes in other crop plants. The project will not only increase our knowledge of drought responses in crop plants but also lead to new approaches aimed at reducing crop losses in the USA.

422,"Plants sense when stress such as drought increases and respond in many ways. Plant hormones induced by water stress play a central role in plant dehydration response. The molecular mechanisms underlying plant hormone signal transduction has been under intensive investigation recently. In addition, plant response is modulated by RNA regulation in stress hormone signal transduction though this process is not well studied. is unclear. We have found that Arabidopsis and rice tandem zinc (AtTZF1) acts as a positive regulator of ABA, and a negative regulator of GA accumulation and/or response. Plants over-expressing AtTZF1 are superior in both drought and cold tolerance. By contrast, loss-of-function mutants are drought sensitive. We hypothesize that plant TZF proteins are involved in stress response by mediating the expression of genes involved in ABA/GA accumulation and/or responses. To test this hypothesis, we will genetically characterize the roles of Arabidopsis and soybean TZFs in various stress responses, and further decipher their relationships with hormones and other stress signaling pathways. We expect to identify novel tools for the manipulation of new crops with enhanced tolerance to water stress.

423,"The primary focus of this Hatch project is to understand the underlying mechanisms of soil processes and plant nutrition uptake that regulate nutrient cycling, identify optimal nutrient management, increase crop yield, and decrease environmental impacts. Climate change, food and energy security, population pressure, and limited natural resources are critical challenges facing agroecosystems. Nutrient cycling is an indispensable component of agroecosystem functions. Soil processes determine soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and thus nutrient availability. Flooded water management is one of the most significant characteristics in irrigated rice agroecosystem and fundamentally modifies soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Accordingly, the intensity and quantity of nutrient availability changes spatially and temporally. Secondly, the nutrient use efficiency is also affected by the interactions between the rice crop and soil processes as regulated by management practices. The interactions between soil properties, root development, and management practices are important aspects for integrated cropping system nutrient management. Recently, however, some studies indicated that enhanced cropping intensity exerts an undesirable effect on soil N availability by affecting soil organic matter quality. One important factor was the accumulation of phenolic lignin compounds in SOM, which is biologically more resistant than other forms of SOM. In addition, many studies have indicated that soil structure dynamics (namely soil aggregate turnover) plays important roles in soil processes and nutrient cycling (Six et al., 1999; Six et al., 2002a; Six et al., 2002b; Dou et al., 2006; Dou et al., 2008). Six et al. (2000) summarized the functions of soil aggregates physically protecting soil organic matter, influencing microbial community structure, limiting O2 diffusion, determining nutrient adsorption and desorption, and reducing runoff and erosion. To improve the fertilizer use efficiency, therefore, it is imperative to incorporate these new findings into rice nutrient management. Besides crop production, environmental quality is another important focus of integrated cropping system nutrient management. Over-applied nutrients (mostly N and P) may enter surrounding water bodies and impair water quality. Inappropriate management practices can result in an increase in the loss of C and N in gaseous forms (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, and N2) some of which are important sources of greenhouse gases. Therefore, nutrient management is very critical for ecosystem productivity, health and sustainability.

424,"The strength of the California floriculture industry is important to the health of the state's economy. California leads the nation in the production of orchids, both as cut flowers and potted flowering plants. It is important to maintain this leadership through research on flower senescence, the molecular biology basis of flower through seed development, and disease resistance that benefits the floriculture industry, as well as indirectly other commercially important flower crops. The California floriculture industry is a $ billion USD industry. California leads the nation in the sale of potted flowering plants, including orchids as the number one commodity. In addition, California employment is boosted by the production of orchids, especially in the leading producing counties of San Diego, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Luis Obispo, and others (CDFA Report 2008-2009, Agricultural Statistics Review). Other public sectors that will benefit include allied suppliers, equipment and greenhouse manufacturers, orchid-related businesses, families of commercial orchid grower employees, researchers, students that receive fellowships to work on orchids, orchid organizations, and the consumers. In short, the proposed project will provide fundamental and practical knowledge to benefit the public welfare in an integrated manner. This will support the production of orchids with lasting quality and by overall supporting the floriculture industry. In the larger context, scientific knowledge will be advanced that could result in improvement of a broader range of commodity crops, including other floral crops, and food crops such as rice, wheat, sorghum, barley and maize (all monocots).

425,"Sustainable lignocellulosic fuel ethanol production from biomass feedstocks at the moment poses significant challenges in total biomass production as well as in bioconversion. Current biomass production needs to be increased by a significant margin to relieve pressure off the cultivated land. This project aims to contribute to the molecular understanding of biomass production by dissecting the genetic pathways that lead to higher total biomass accumulation in C4 grasses of biofuel importance primarily sorghum and switchgrass. The overall objective of the research is to understand genetic networks of key developmental programs that significantly contribute to total biomass production, and subsequently manipulate biomass for biofuel feedstock improvement. The program will focus on C4 grasses using sorghum as a model and switchgrass as the main target species, but molecular genetic information will be integrated from other well studied species including Arabidopsis, Medicago, rice, and maize. We aim to uncover major genetic control points and identify key transcription factors that invoke a systems level response in C4 grass developmental programs. We are targeting four major but interconnected plant developmental programs; leaf development, flowering time, plant height, and tiller number, which are all critically important for understanding total biomass accumulation. We also plan to develop a functional genomics tool in sorghum which will help us to discover key biomass regulatory genes and genetic networks in both sorghum and switchgrass and other C4 grasses. We will employ transformation, biochemical, cellular, genetic, and genomic approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of these developmental programs and their interactions with the environment thereby to manipulate biomass for increased feedstock productivity. When these projects are successfully completed, we expect to have: 1) a better understanding of the genes and genetic pathways that control total biomass production in sorghum and switchgrass, 2) a comprehensive understanding of the leaf lamina expansion pathway in plants, 3) molecular markers that can be used for biomass in switchgrass breeding programs, 4) optimized transformation procedure for switchgrass and a potentially higher biomass producing transgenic switchgrass, and 5) a deletion population derived comprehensive forward and reverse genetics tool in sorghum for functional genomics studies in C4 grasses.

426,"Fungi are a predominant component of the terrestrial ecosystem. Although the extent and diversity of ecological niches occupied by fungi has not been fully defined, they are generally acknowledged as the most important class of plant pathogens. For example, annual losses caused by a single fungus, the rice blast fungus, are estimated to approach 150 million tons of grain. The ability of most fungi to cause plant disease is dependent upon their capacity to form filamentous hyphae that are compartmentalized by septa. However, the mechanisms underlying hyphal morphogenesis and septum formation remain poorly understood. Besides providing new insight into how fungi colonize plants, a better understanding of these mechanisms promises to identify attractive new targets for the chemical or biological control of fungal disease.

427,"The lactic acid bacteria have a long history of safe utilization by the vegetable and grain/cereal fermentation industries (e.g. use in the manufacture of sauerkraut from cabbage or ethanologenic manufacture of sake from rice, respectively). As a result, the lactic acid bacteria are attractive candidates to serve as biocatalysts for biofuels fermentations because they possess diverse carbohydrate (sugar)-utilization pathways and are highly resistant to many microbial inhibitors (including ethanol and organic acids) that result from fermentation. These biocatalysts will be used either synergistically with existing culture systems (i.e., to complement their functionality) or to replace them. Ethanol-producing lactic acid bacteria, including: (i) industrial strains currently used in food and beverage manufacture; (ii) strains isolated the gut of foraging insects, such as the wood-eating cockroaches and their close relative, the termite; and (iii) strains isolated from ocontamination-bloomedo biofuel production runs obtained from industrial partners, will be examined for novel metabolic properties. The project proposed here will help to identify fermentation accelerants and inhibitors, which will enable better selection of biocatalysts for a given substrate matrix, that, if better understood, can be used to both optimize and economize biofuel fermentations.

428,"Rice contributes 23 percent of the calories consumed worldwide, but each year 10 to 30 percent of the global rice harvest enough to feed 60 million people - is lost to infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Because traditional plant breeding strategies have been unable to produce durable blast-resistant rice cultivars, containment of this severe threat to global food security is likely to come from a better understanding of the molecular and cellular processes underlying the plant-fungal interaction. M. oryzae is ideally suited to such study because: 1) it can be cultured away from its host plant, 2) it is amenable to rapid gene functional analysis, and 3) both M. oryzae and its rice host plant have sequenced genomes. M. oryzae plant infection is mediated by a specialized structure, called the appressorium, which develops from an asexual spore of M. oryzae adhered to the leaf surface. The mature appressorium generates enormous turgor through the accumulation of glycerol, and this pressure is translated into mechanical force acting on a penetration peg emerging at the base of the cell, causing it to breach the leaf cuticle and enter the plant. However, the physical nature of M. oryzae host entry belies the fact that once within the plant, the fungus forms an intimate association with the plant tissue and proliferates from cell to cell in a symptomless, biotrophic manner for the first 72 hours of infection. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine how M. oryzae is able to evade or suppress the host response, how it controls the development of infectious hyphae during the biotrophic growth phase, and what triggers the switch to symptom development following the first 72 hours. asexual; base; Blast Cell; Breeding; Calories; Cell physiology; Cells; Containment; Development; feeding; food security; fungus; gene discovery; Genes; genome sequencing; Glycerol; Growth; Harvest; Hour; Hyphae; Immune response; Infection; Magnaporthe; Mechanics; Mediating; Molecular; Nature; Oryza; Penetration; Phase; plant fungi; Plant Leaves; Plants; pressure; Proliferating; Reproduction spores; Resistance; Rice; Structure; Surface; Symptoms; Tissues; TranslatingPATHOGENIC GENE DISCOVERY IN THE DEVASTATING RICE BLAST FUNGUS MAGNAPORTHE ORYZAE",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06
429,"In the last century, one significant, observed change in the environment is an increase in night temperatures. Surprisingly, rice yields have dropped in these warmer nights, even though generally warmer temperatures are are associated with increased yield (Peng et al., PNAS 2004; Welch, et al. PNAS 2010). It is not known why this night-time increase in temperature leads to reduced yield. However, one possibility is that the decrease in temperature differential between night and day affects the internal timekeeping mechanism in rice (the circadian clock). Much like humans, plants have an internal clock that controls the timing of daily activities. The plant circadian clock allows the plant to anticipate recurring daily activities. For example, plants increase their photosynthetic capacity before the sun actually rises in anticipation of dawn. Furthermore, plants also track seasonal changes by comparing daylength changes to the  time  of their internal clocks. The circadian clock controls many aspects of plant growth, and, like shift workers and jet-lagged people, plants with clocks that are out-of-sync with the environment are less fit. Therefore, plants use both light and temperature cues (warm days/ cold nights) to keep their circadian clocks set to the right time. When we artificially separate the light and temperature cues, we observe that the photoperiod (light days and dark nights) regulates the expression of thousands of genes. When only temperature cycles were tested (warm days and cold nights) thousands of genes were also regulated. But surprisingly, these genes did not overlap with those regulated by photocycles (Filichkin, PLOS 2011). It is not understood in any plant species how these different environmental cues each contribute to the importance of the circadian clock in regulating growth and stress responses in plants. This study investigates the role that different environmental backgrounds (light cycles, temperature cycles, and combinations of these) play in the regulation of rice genes and the effects that these different environmental cues have on the response to salt stress. Stress from environmental factors, such as high salt-soils, low temperature and drought has a dramatic impact on plant growth in the United States and worldwide, reducing the yield of major crops by up to 50%. With changing climate and weather patterns, these losses may increase, while the demand for food and fuel from our farmlands continues to grow. To understand the impact that the circadian clock has in regulating the response to salt stress in rice we are employing state-of-the art bioinformatic methods to combine circadian regulation of genes with the effects of salt-stress in rice. Analyzing salt-stress responses and effects in this approach will provide a robust start for identifying regulatory mechanisms of salt stress response. These studies have the exciting potential to impact future crop studies and offer the opportunity to apply basic research to alleviating hunger and address the impacts of climate change on crops.

430,"This is a four state collaboration research project. Over 75% of rice production in the U. S. occurs in the South, and Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas are among the leading producers with a value of $ 2 billion annually. Sheath blight is the most serious disease, causing millions of dollars of losses annually. Ratoon (second) crop producers have very limited fungicide options for use and suffer heavy yield losses. None of the leading high yielding cultivars have acceptable levels of resistance. Growers mostly rely on fungicides and apply 1 million pounds of them annually to rice, costing growers 26 million dollars a year for control of diseases, primarily for sheath blight control. Continual, extensive use of fungicides makes existing disease management practices unaffordable and non-sustainable. Rice producers, especially ratoon crop producers, are in urgent need of sustainable and environmentally-friendly management alternatives. Brassica cover cropping and biocontrol bacterial agents have demonstrated ability to suppress sheath blight in our research and offer a new potential for managing this disease. Brassica crops produce chemicals toxic to the sheath blight pathogen and reduce primary inoculum in soil by the process of biofumigation. The overall objective of this project is to develop novel, biologically-based management strategies for integrated control of sheath blight by using brassica biofumigation cover crops and biocontrol bacterial agents combined with reduced fungicide rates and partially resistant cultivars. This program will provide new disease management tools for rice producers in the South while reducing use of fungicides by more than 50%.

434,"Objective(s): (1) Develop spectroscopic imaging procedures (hyperspectral or multispectral) that can be used to assess quality of small grains (emphasizing wheat, rice, and barley) and oilseeds in bulk for grade, class, foreign material, and damage (mold, black point, heat, frost, and insect). (1a). Develop hyperspectral image analysis algorithms for determination of the level of mold damage from Fusarium Head Blight on wheat kernels. This will involve the development of image processing routines that identify the infected kernels in representative samples of intact wheat kernels and determine the regions of Fusarium damage within each infected kernel. (1b) Develop hyperspectral image analysis algorithms for identification of wheat kernels damaged by heat, frost, black point, and insects, as defined by official inspection criteria. (1c) Develop hyperspectral image analysis algorithms for the prediction of flour yield and break flour yield in soft red winter wheat. (2) Develop optical and mechanical methods and instrumentation for grain quality measurement that are applicable at points of sale, such as elevators, terminals, and mills. (2a) Develop rapid and objective optical methods for prediction of starch quality indicators in wheat, such as the ratio of amylose-to-amylopectin, and the identification of wheat into three states of waxiness: waxy, partial waxy, and wild type. (2b) Improve existing procedures or develop replacement procedures that serve as indicators of the level of alpha-amylase activity in harvested wheat.Approach:   Fusarium-inoculated hard red spring and hard red winter wheat samples will be imaged using an in-house near-IR hyperspectral system. Image analysis will be a multistep process. First, for each kernel a mask will be created from one of images whose wavelength creates a strong contrast between kernel and background. The mask will be applied to the images at all other wavelengths in order to remove the background. Principal component analysis (PCA) loadings from images of damaged and normal regions will be examined to identify the wavelengths at local minima and maxima, which inherently possess the greatest contrast between Fusarium damage and healthy endosperm. Hyperspectral image analysis will also be used to examine three wheat milling properties: milling yield (% straight grade flour) defined as the percent by mass of all flour fractions recovered through a 94-mesh screen; solvent retention capacity in 50% (w/w) sucrose solution, a measure of the water affinity of the macro-polymers (starch, arabinoxylans, gluten, and gliadins); and solvent retention capacity in 5% (w/w) lactic acid, an indicator of gluten strength. Near-IR spectroscopy will explored as a method for measuring the degree of waxiness in hexaploid wheat. Wild type, partial waxy (waxy null alleles in one or two genomes), and waxy samples (null alleles in all genomes), drawn from breeders' advanced lines of hexaploid wheat, will be used. Gel electrophoresis will be used to identify the waxy protein (granule bound starch synthase, GBSS) in each sample. Lastly, a near-IR procedure for wheat gluten quality will be developed in conjunction with a rheological procedure. The wheat samples consist of approximately 50 lines grown in field replicated (3x) plots over three consecutive seasons. Half of these lines are transgenic, in which the gene construct modifies the length of the central repeat region within the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits. Different levels of gene expression, hence, level of glutenin protein, are represented as a function of the transgenic ancestor. Thus, this set will contain a much wider range in the ratio of glutenin-to-gliadin than naturally encountered. Flour from these samples will be evaluated for glutenin and gliadin contents by SE-HPLC another ARS laboratory. At Beltsville, the flour will be scanned in the NIR and FT-mid-IR regions. Rheological properties, such as the recovery response for a gluten specimen subjected to a controlled regiment of compressive force and hold time, will be measured at a third laboratory. Spectral calibrations for glutenin and gliadin concentrations, as well as calibrations for the rheological parameters (percent recovery and recovery time constant), will be developed using partial least squares regression. Additionally, classification algorithms (PLS discriminant analysis and SVM) algorithms will be developed that will identify the genetically modified lines based on their spectral response.

Develop legume-based beverages formulated with conventional and non-conventional food ingredients, flours and protein powders from rice, wheat, and barley cooked by extrusion processing, drum drying, open kettle, pressure cooking, microwave cooking, and infrared cooking. The resulting cooked legume-based products in the form of powders will be used directly or pretreated by high pressure, microfluidizer processing, and high shear technology, as the base component for beverages with functional properties. This project involves the production of novel snack foods and beverages from legumes, barley, rice, potatoes and other agricultural products. The development of nutritious and tasty foods requires knowledge about the phytonutrients and flavor precursors present in the raw materials.

The scientists on this project have expertise in their respective areas and will work closely to achieve the objectives.Approach:   Extrusion processing will be used to produce new value-added foods with enhanced nutritional and sensory properties. Extrusion operational parameters such as moisture content, temperature, feed rate, screw speed and screw element configuration will be optimized. Ingredients from barley, rice, and potato will be added to legume flours to enhance the physicochemical properties of the extruded products including both snacks and beverages. To understand the influence of processing on flavor, phytonutrients and antioxidant activity, qualitative and quantitative studies will be performed on the agricultural products before and after processing. Impact flavor constituents will be localized, characterized and quantified using aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), calculation of odor units, and preparation of aroma models. Aroma compounds responsible for desirable and undesirable flavor characteristics will be identified and formation pathways will be elucidated.

436,"This pilot project has contributed to the broader mission of the Dartmouth Center for Children&rsquo;s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research to understand the health effects of low-dose exposure to environmental contaminants, including arsenic, by quantifying sources of arsenic exposure during the first year of life. The public health effects of arsenic in food, especially rice, are only beginning to be evaluated, but are a particularly pressing issue in regions such as New Hampshire where arsenic contamination of private well water is already a concern. We began the pilot project with one primary aim and two secondary aims:Primary Aim: To determine how infant consumption of breast milk and formula contributes to exposure to arsenic during the first 4 months of life.Secondary Aim 1: To begin evaluating how increased infant consumption of solid foods affects arsenic exposure during the period from 4-12 months.Secondary Aim 2: To test the feasibility of measuring urinary metabolites of arsenic in infants at 4 months of age, and determine the relationships among urinary arsenic, arsenic ingestion estimated from food and water, and toenail arsenic levels. During the course of the project, primary aim and secondary aim 2 coalesced, in that we evaluated exposure via breast milk and formula not only via direct arsenic measurements in these food sources, but also using urinary arsenic biomarkers in 6-week old infants. To our knowledge, these are the earliest measurements of urinary arsenic made to date. Quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) of the urinary arsenic measurements is ensured through the use of National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable standards, certified standard reference materials, blank samples, and blinded replicate samples by the analytical laboratories to which samples were sent. The primary achievements of this pilot project include nine published papers, two papers in preparation, numerous presentations at scientific meetings, and direct communication with the press and the public about our findings. For example, results to date confirm the seminal role of rice cereal, but have also demonstrated arsenic exposure due to the rice-based sweeteners (especially organic brown rice syrup, OBRS) that are increasingly used in place of high-fructose corn syrup in certain food markets. Our paper on OBRS (Jackson et al. 2012b) alerted a toddler formula manufacturer to the presence of arsenic in their products, and prompted a re-evaluation of the supply chain that resulted in reduced arsenic exposure within about 6 months of the paper&rsquo;s online publication. Moreover, our work on OBRS goes well beyond children&#39;s health, since this product is widely used in both the organic and athletic performance food markets (Jackson, et al., 2012b).

437,"Mortality and morbidity due to trauma are major public health problems. The leading cause of death for persons ages 1 to 34 is trauma and 3rd for persons age 35 to 54. It is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States for persons of all ages (Hoyert et al., 1999).  The majority of trauma-related deaths are due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent estimates indicate that 80,000 to 90,000 have a new onset of disability each year due to TBI (Thurman et al., 1999a).  More than a million Americans to live with disability due to TBI (Thurman et al., 1999b).  While the emotional cost of TBI is incalculable, the lifetime cost for persons who sustain TBI each year is estimated to be 37 billion dollars (Max, MacKenzie, & Rice, 1991). In addition to civilian-related trauma, America’s armed forces are sustaining new and complex traumatic injuries as part of the current military activities. Military servicepersons are returning from war with a myriad of complex medical conditions including TBI.  At this time, the physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments remain a challenge to the VA Healthcare system. The Veterans Affairs Central Office has developed an inter-agency agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’s National Institute on Disability, Independent Living,  and Rehabilitation and Research (NIDILRR) TBI Model System Program to manage a database of variables associated with injury severity and outcomes associated with the longitudinal recovery course associated with TBI for persons in the VA health care system. Collaboration with the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC), a component of the Defense Centers of Excellence (DCoE), through data collection, data sharing and expertise on traumatic brain injuries, especially with the active duty military and veteran populations, will also be part of this joint initiative. Among many uses, the primary purpose of this data will be used to gauge performance of VA PRC inpatient rehabilitation programs relative to the private sector TBI inpatient rehabilitation programs part of the TBI Model Systems Programs. The TBI Model System Program is a competitively funded, longitudinal multi-center study which examines the course of recovery and outcomes following the delivery of a coordinated system of acute neurotrauma and inpatient rehabilitation in the private sector. Currently, the TBIMS program has documented outcomes for persons up to 20 years post injury. Approximately 8, 000 persons with TBI having undergone inpatient rehabilitation are being tracked in the TBI Model System Program. The knowledge and expertise of this competitively funded system is being adapted for characterization and monitoring of outcomes for persons with TBI treated in the VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center (VA PRC) health care system. Knowledge gained from systematic comparison of VA TBI Model System programs with private sector TBI Model System programs will help develop benchmarks for program improvement within the VA PRC health care system. Finally, data collected will be used to supplement investigator-initiated studies of TBI within the VA PRC health care system.

438,"ABSTRACT Intellectual Merit: Lignocellulose can be thought as a spatially and compositionally complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. There has been great progress in understanding and controlling the breakdown chemistry of cellulose and hemicellulose, in the upconversion of their constituent carbohydrate intermediates into ethanol, BTX, furans, and other chemical species. In contrast, there is less progress on lignin and the effect of lignin interaction with cellulosic components during the process. The association of lignins with carbohydrates presents a serious challenge for the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. This proposal from Investigators Michael Wong of William Marsh Rice University and Conrad Zhang of KiOR Inc. describes a one-year collaborative research plan between the university and industrial corporation that focuses on the  interface  chemistry between the building units of lignin and cellulose of different feeds, and to study the impact of this chemistry on the rate and product distribution profiles during a thermocatalytic conversion process. Unlike other studies which either focus solely on model lignin or cellulose breakdown products, this project focuses on lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs) as a model of a lignocellulose breakdown intermediate. It is hypothesized that the pyrolytic decomposition of lignocellulose generates LCCs as a chemical intermediate, and its chemistry is, so far, not accounted for. The goals of this work are to determine the heterogeneously catalyzed transformation routes and kinetics of LCCs, and to establish some general criteria for designing catalytic materials that can control LCC transformation pathways and kinetics.Broader Impacts: The renewed academic and industrial interest in lignocellulosic biomass as a sustainable sourceof fuel, chemicals, and energy has been tremendous, in response to the worldwide concerns ofenergy security, global warming, and sustainable development. Various approaches to convert lignocellulose into higher-value products are being investigated, with catalytic conversion into transportation fuel and basic chemicals as a promising direction. The unknown nature of the  interface  between the lignin and cellulose fractions in lignocellulose presents technical challenges in the catalytic upconversion of biomass. Studying lignincarbohydrate complexes addresses these challenges, potentially lowering the activation barrier to improvements in commercialization. This project, as a collaboration between a university and a company, will also provide for the multidisciplinary training of 1 post-doctoral research associate in chemical kinetics, heterogeneous catalysis, and materials chemistry, state-of-the-art analytical techniques, and industrial collaborations. The post-doctoral member will receive guidance and training according to a well-defined postdoctoral mentoring plan.

440,"Flooding events significantly damage agricultural production in the US and elsewhere. The development of crop cultivars that can survive short-term flooding can help stabilize and increase food production. The recent recognition of rice varieties tolerant to short-term flooding has led to the identification of the submergence tolerance regulator gene called SUB1A. The precise genetic characterization of SUB1A has allowed breeders to develop new high-yielding rice varieties with submergence tolerance that are now grown in flood-prone fields of South and Southeast Asia. This project will continue the molecular characterization of SUB1A and seek new submergence regulators that act earlier in development. Rice plants that can survive flooding during seed germination can reduce labor cost and herbicide use. The effectiveness of combining SUB1A with the recently identified ANAEROBIC GERMINATION 1 (AG1) gene will be explored in rice. Additionally, the characterization of molecular responses to flooding will be extended to corn, a vital grain crop that is flooding sensitive. These analyses will examine genetic variation in anaerobic germination and submergence tolerance in maize as well as profile and manipulate molecular responses to these stresses. The results will provide a greater understanding of sensing, signaling and response mechanisms to flooding during seed germination and vegetative growth in rice and maize. The research will be carried out at a Hispanic Serving institution. Postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers will receive cross-disciplinary training in physiology, molecular biology, analytical chemistry and systems biology in a multicultural laboratory and institute environment. The development and dissemination of a science-learning module will allow 8th graders, many from underrepresented groups, at Title I schools to participate in hands-on science experiments demonstrating the significance of plant biology research on food security and sustainable agriculture.

443,"PI: Michael Purugganan [New York University (NYU)]CoPI: Richard Bonneau (NYU)Key Collaborator:  Endang Septiningsih (International Rice Research Institute, the Philippines)Plants in the real world are continuously exposed to multiple environmental signals and must respond appropriately to the dynamic conditions found in nature. Environmental signals can fluctuate during an individual's life cycle with varying degrees of predictability, and complex natural environments are the norm. This project will analyze public data and undertake time-series microarray experiments to infer Environmental Gene Regulatory Interaction Networks (EGRINs) in the rice leaf associated with fluctuating environmental signals. The research focus will be on temperature and water availability, and examine genomic networks for these environmental signals in four different landraces adapted to rainfed upland versus paddy field lowland environments. This research will adapt and scale-up computational methods for biclustering and network inference for use with plant transcriptome data, including the use of data from multiple genotypes. Rice global gene expression patterns in natural seasonal environments will be studied by carrying out transcriptome analyses in different agricultural field conditions. This study provides a systematic determination of genomic networks associated with environmental signals and their behavior in ecologically relevant field conditions. This work lays the foundation for a broader dissection of plant responses to both normal environmental fluctuations as well as extreme environmental conditions that lead to plant stress, and develop systems biological approaches to understanding plant-environmental interactions. These results will be especially useful in understanding plant response to climate fluctuations, as well as develop cultivars that can tolerate temperature and water stress in agricultural environments.This project will develop software packages for gene network inference in plants, and provide inferred gene biclusters and networks to the plant science community through Gramene (www.gramene.org).  As part of the outreach efforts, graduate-level science journalism students from the NYU Science, Health and Environment Reporting Program will also be trained in plant genomics and systems biology. Finally, plant biologists from both the US and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) will also be trained in systems biology by developing a Rice Systems Biology training workshop to be held at IRRI.

444,"In plasmas, charged particles move together in concert to produce density or velocity patterns that oscillate in time in what are called collective modes. Collective modes often dominate the properties of plasmas, such as their stability, so it is crucial to understand them. This work will study ion collective modes in ultracold neutral plasmas for the first time. Ultracold neutral plasmas are created by laser ionization of clouds of atoms that have been cooled to temperatures as low as 1/1000th of a degree above absolute zero.  In addition to expanding our fundamental understanding of an exotic regime of nature, these experiments may shed light on the physics of dense plasmas in thermonuclear devices or the cores of gas giant planets.The broader impact of this proposal starts with the training of graduate students for careers in science and technology. It is augmented by the diversity of Rice's physics program and strength of Rice's geographical location for attracting minority students to the program. One third of the students who have worked on these projects in the past have been women, and one third have been under-represented minorities. An additional goal of the project is to attract and retain more students in science and engineering through involvement of undergraduate students. These experiments are ideal for this purpose because concepts are accessible and lasers capture students' imaginations. career; Charge; density; Devices; Engineering; Gases; Geographic Locations; Goals; graduate student; Imagination; ionization; Ions; Lasers; Light; Minority; Nature; particle; Pattern; Physics; Planets; Plasma; programs; Property; research study; Rice; Science; Stream; Students; Technology; Temperature; Time; Training; Underrepresented Minority; Woman; WorkSTREAMING ULTRACOLD NEUTRAL PLASMAS",0.999999,1e-06,3.904772491212727e-05,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
445,"This NSF award by the Office of Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation supports a collaboration between investigators at Rice University and the University of Washington to engineer bacterial stem cells to grow and divide into a wide variety of multicellular patterns and structures. In biology, multicellular tissues and organisms arise from undifferentiated stem cells via complex processes of embryogenesis and development. How large numbers of noisy and error-prone biological cells precisely coordinate their actions over space and time remains an open and challenging question. Here the investigators will take an engineering approach to this problem, by constructing a model multicellular  developmental  system in the bacterium E. coli. The genetics of E. coli are well understood and the organism is therefore very amenable to engineering.  Moreover, because E. coli does not naturally form patterns, it is a blank slate where any pattern formed can be more easily attributed to the engineered genetic program.This research program combines immediate practical impact with conceptual depth. The proposed work will enable a potentially transformative technology for controlling the growth of tissues and higher order cellular structures through engineered cell-cell communication. The approach incorporates key features of biological pattern formation, such as (i) the use of positional information encoded within gradients of extracellular signals, (ii) intercellular communication, (iii) feedback and signal processing and (iv) epigenetic inheritance of states. The investigators will develop and quantitatively characterize molecular devices for implementing each of these core functionalities and will then modularly combine those elements into increasingly complex pattern-forming circuits. Experimental work will be guided by mathematical modeling and will take advantage of a custom-made programming formalism for specifying desired shapes and patterns. This group of investigators has highly complementary expertise in signal processing, cell-cell signaling, distributed computing and synthetic biology. This will allow the investigators to produce a combined experimental-computational design cycle that will accelerate the rate of progress in this challenging and important research area.This technology will have great scientific, economic and societal impact. The last decade of synthetic biology boasted a series of significant advances in engineering cellular sensing and signal transduction and constructing synthetic DNA at large scale. Harnessing these advances for the engineering of coordinated multicellular behaviors, best exemplified in pattern formation, is now a major goal in the field. This collaborative effort will significantly advance the current state of the art in programmed pattern formation by developing a rigorous framework to engineer a single stem cell to grow and differentiate into any arbitrary pattern. The outcomes of this work will impact developmental biology, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, metabolic engineering and biomaterials research.This work is tightly integrated with an outreach program that has two main goals. The first goal is to develop an educational program to teach students the interdisciplinary skills necessary to be successful in synthetic biology. To achieve this goal, the PIs are developing a three course curriculum that is coordinated between several departments at Rice University and the University of Washington. The second goal is to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in engineering disciplines. This will be achieved through established outreach programs aimed at high school teachers, incoming freshmen, underrepresented minorities and women. In particular, the PIs will develop new biological teaching tools that take advantage of the visually compelling experimental systems constructed here.

448,"Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is saline and two-thirds of the existing fresh water deposit is locked away in snow and ice, leaving only one percent for human use. Since the majority of fresh water is used to grow food, the changing climate will challenge our food supply as drought events become more frequent and intense. Therefore, it is critical to develop a new generation of crops that can sustain productivity with reduced fresh water input. This project fills a significant gap in our understanding on how unfavorable environment perturbs seed development and ultimately affects plant productivity. Because seeds from cereals (such as rice, maize, and wheat) are the primary source of calories, and rice is an established model for cereals, this work will focus on how drought stress adversely affects early seed development in rice resulting in reduced seed size. Taking a molecular and biochemical approach, the project team will identify rice genes that are critical for normal seed development, but whose expression is altered by drought stress. This work will elucidate how seed, arguably the most economically important plant organ as food source, senses and adapts to a changing environment. This project will be important for developing future crops that are needed for mitigating and adapting to changing climate. The project will broaden participation in STEM workforce by training persons with disabilities. The PIs will work with the Office for Students with Disabilities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) to recruit, and train qualified individuals into project research activities.

449,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The research goal of this EAGER project is to probe one of the most important problems on the mechanical behavior of metals at the nanoscale, namely experimental verification of the existence of a mechanism of plasticity involving the transition from a dislocation interaction controlled regime to a surface dislocation nucleation dominated regime. The specific technical objectives are to integrate recently developed in situ micro-mechanical nanoindentation stages in both the SEM and TEM. These will be used for systematic high-resolution quantitative investigations of the deformation of high-quality single crystalline Au, Ag, Cu and Ni nanowires with well-controlled dimensions. In addition to geometrical size effects, the roles of strain rate and temperature will also be investigated.NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The study of deformation mechanisms in metals has been of paramount importance in developing the field of metallurgy. With the recent emergence of nanotechnology and the advancement of experimental techniques, investigating the deformation mechanism of metals at the nanoscale has become both technologically relevant and scientifically important. The successful implementation of the proposed work will help elucidate the important transitions from dislocation-interaction-controlled-plasticity to surface-dislocation-nucleation-controlled plasticity in metals. The studies carried out at different loading rates and temperatures will provide valuable information on kinetic aspects of metal plasticity at the nanoscale. The educational goal of this EAGER proposal is to inspire students to pursue successful careers in science and engineering fields. This will be done by integrating the proposed research work with a number of educational and outreach efforts, including creating innovative lab modules for undergraduate students at Rice, mentoring under-representative undergraduate students and local high school teachers and students for summer research experiences. career; Dimensions; Dislocations; Engineering; experience; Goals; high school; In Situ; innovation; Investigation; Kinetics; mechanical behavior; Mechanics; Mentors; Metallurgy; Metals; nanoindentation; nanoscale; Nanotechnology; nanowire; outreach; Research; Resolution; Rice; Role; School Teachers; Science; Staging; Students; Surface; Techniques; Temperature; Transition Elements; WorkEAGER: PROBING DEFORMATION MECHANISM TRANSITION OF METALS AT THE NANOSCALE",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
450,"Intellectual Merit:  This project focuses on Pack-MULEs, a special group of  jumping genes  (transposable elements) that are abundant in plants. A unique feature of Pack-MULEs is their ability to duplicate, reorganize, and shuffle DNA fragments in the genome. As a result, Pack-MULEs are potential  gene machines , capable of generating new genes or modifying existing genes and thus contributing to gene and genome evolution. Despite the abundance of Pack-MULEs, little is known about often Pack-MULEs acquire new gene functions or the mechanisms by which these elements duplicate DNA fragments. This research will determine how many of the 3,000 Pack-MULEs in rice encode bona fide proteins and will study the function of a subset of Pack-MULE-associated proteins. In addition, this study will elucidate the impact of Pack-MULE formation on existing genes and determine the factors that promote sequence duplication by Pack-MULEs. Together, these studies will contribute to better understanding of how transposable elements shape genome evolution.Broader impacts: Students at different levels will be trained with cutting-edge approaches in molecular genetics and computational biology. This project will assist undergraduate students from under-represented groups in their application for graduate study. Through a local public educational garden, this project will provide education to K-12 students and other visitors on  the importance of plants for food and on  genetic mechanisms that result in phenotypic diversity.

453,"Drs. Cymene Howe and Dominic Boyer (Rice University) will study the political culture of wind power development in Mexico. Although the transition from carbon fuels to cleaner energy is widely regarded as one of the most pressing environmental and social challenges facing humanity in the 21st century, it remains unclear how energy transition goals can be achieved, especially when dominant economic and social policies across the world often question the legitimacy and effectiveness of government-led development.This project's central research question is whether contemporary states, especially those already struggling to meet their governmental obligations, possess the political authority to implement important programs of national development such as renewable energy. The research focuses on Mexico, a country that has been deeply impacted by economic globalization and neoliberal policy since the early 1980s, and that has experienced significant recent declines in oil production. In response, the Mexican government has outlined an ambitious plan to develop renewable energy resources over the next 15 years. Wind power is a centerpiece of this plan owing to excellent wind resources in the southern state of Oaxaca.  Drs. Howe and Boyer will complete 16 months of field research in Mexico in 2012 and 2013 using interviews, participant-observation, focus groups, archival research and two community surveys. The project's research hypotheses focus on the interactions between four major stakeholders in wind power development - state and federal government officials, Oaxacan communities, transnational energy corporations, and media organizations. The primary objectives of the study are (1) to map the interactions between these stakeholders, (2) to identify instances of contention, cooperation and brokerage among them, and (3) to identify assertions and relations of political authority in order to determine what set of interests and considerations are ultimately driving the process of wind power development.  The study will generate uniquely rich ethnographic data on the political culture and processes of renewable energy development in Mexico that will inform scientific research and policy debates on attempts to transition to renewable energy internationally. authority; Automobile Driving; Carbon; Communities; Community Surveys; Country; Data; Development; economic impact; Economics; Effectiveness; Environmental Wind; Ethnography; experience; Federal Government; Focus Groups; Goals; Government; Government Officials; Humanities; interest; Interview; Legitimacy; Maps; meetings; Mexican; Mexico; Oils; Participant; Policies; Policy Research; Process; Production; programs; Research; Research Project Grants; Resources; response; Rice; social; Social Policies; UniversitiesTHE POLITICAL CULTURE OF WIND POWER DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHERN MEXICO",1e-06,1e-06,0.999939708841582,1e-06,1e-06,0.009086854433928267,0.999999
454,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor R. Bruce Weisman and his group at Rice University are devising methods to better characterize single-walled carbon nanotubes, which are among the most promising new materials emerging from nanotechnology research. These long molecular-sized tubes of chemically bonded carbon atoms display remarkable physical properties which promise advances in fields including high performance materials, nano-scale electronics, solar energy harvesting, and medical diagnostics and therapy. A barrier to realizing these applications is often the assortment of different nanotube structures - each with different properties - which result from nanotube synthesis. This project is developing and enhancing convenient and nondestructive optical nanotube analysis methods using near-infrared light. Novel instrumentation is being developed to enhance the speed and effectiveness of analysis, and to improve capabilities for physically sorting nanotube mixtures by structure. This work should enable progress in sorting nanotube samples according to length, an important goal for many applications.The project provides valuable research experience to a number of undergraduate and graduate students. The analysis methods developed and refined will likely be incorporated into commercial scientific instruments. More broadly, the technical results of the project will also help overcome some of the obstacles that now hamper commercial production of nanotube-based devices and products. This may have a positive effect on the U.S. economy because of the substantial potential value of nanotube applications. base; Carbon; Chemicals; Chemistry; Devices; Diagnostic; Effectiveness; Electronics; experience; Goals; graduate student; Harvest; Image; Image Analysis; improved; instrument; instrumentation; Length; Light; Measurement; Medical; Methods; molecular size; nanoscale; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; novel; Optics; Performance; physical property; Production; professor; programs; Property; Research; Rice; Sampling; single walled carbon nanotube; Solar Energy; Sorting - Cell Movement; Structure; Tube; Universities; WorkOPTICAL ANALYSIS AND IMAGING OF SINGLE-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,2.8004260293191508e-06,3.7757825286195115e-06
455,"The central topic of this project is Diophantine and Combinatorial Properties of Dynamical Systems in general and Interval Exchange Transformations (IETs) in particular.  In 1993 the PI, Boshernitzan,  initiated study of Quantitative Recurrence (QR) obtaining a quantitative enhancement of the celebrated Poincare recurrence theorem claiming that typical orbits of dynamical systems (under some mild conditions) return arbitrarily close to their initial position. The quantitative enhancement addresses the question how soon and how close this recurrence takes place. It turns out that the answer to these questions is possible in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the space. In the last two years the PI and his student, Jon Chaika, initiated research that studyies in a  quantitative manner the Connectivity and Proximality phenomena in dynaThe Connectivity property of a dynamical system manifests itself in that, for a typical pair of points in the space, the closures of the orbits of these points coincide. Connectivity is more restrictive than Recurrence. Certain assumptions (like minimality or ergodicity) are imposed for the phenomenon to hold.  The Proximality property manifests itself in that a typical pair of points is proximal, i.e. their orbits approach each other arbitrary close. The phenomenon of Proximality is not universal (but it holds for weakly-mixing systems). Some initial results on Quantitative Connectivity and Proximality (QCP) were obtained recently in joint work by the PI and his student, Chaika, where a number of important related questions were posed. These results generalize and strengthen some classical results in Diophantine analysis (in Number theory) and are related to the recent work of others in the area of  shrinking targets  and  monotone shrinking target property  of dynamical systems. The results are detailed and complete and of interest when applied to IETs. IETs are invertible piecewise orientation preserving isometries of the unit interval into itself and their study is motivated not only by their intrinsic interest as generalizations of the rotations of the unit circle and the simplest invertible maps which preserve Lebesgue measure, but also by their applications such as to area preserving flows in compact surfaces, and in Teichmuller theory. The study of QR initiated in 1993 attracted a lot of attention in the national and international mathematical community motivating much further research and development in this and related areas.  The QCP project is a natural continuation of the QR project and it is hoped that it will have an impact on research in Dynamical Systems and related fields similar that of the CR.  Many open problems and various connections with other fields of mathematics (Ergodic Theory, IETs, Teichmuller Theory, area preserving flows in compact surfaces), may keep researchers in the subject busy for years to come.  Throughout the last 28 years, PI Boshernitzan has been responsible for the selection and coaching the Rice team (and all interested students) for the Putnam mathematical competition. He has mentored graduate students, the most recent one is Jon Chaika (2010) who himself has earned much recognition by the mathematical community.

458,"TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis CAREER award supports theoretical research aimed at developing new analytical and numerical tools to treat strongly correlated many-body dynamics in nanostructures and low-dimensional systems.  The main focus of the proposal is to understand general properties of many-body dynamics of strongly correlated systems out of equilibrium.  The proposal concentrates on the investigation of systems that can be described by effective models of impurities coupled to a continuum of modes, as illustrated by the case of a quantum dot coupled to leads.  Most of the specific projects will be addressed using techniques introduced by the PI directed towards the description of impurity-type models and their generalizations. In particular, the following directions will be pursued:(i) The Kondo effect in nanostructures. The ultimate goal of this research direction is to obtain new analytical results for the non equilibrium dynamical properties of nanostructures in the Kondo regime, such as nonlinear conductance through the quantum dot.(ii) Strongly correlated quantum optics. Preparation and control of   strongly correlated states of photons by coupling them to quantum dots will be considered. (iii) Non equilibrium dynamics of ultracold gases on nanofabricated chips.  Ultracold gases provide a fertile ground to investigate non-equilibrium phase transitions, thermalization and transition from integrable to chaotic behavior in an isolated quantum system.(iv) Two-dimensional Fermi-Luttinger liquids. A universal approach to dynamical properties of two-dimensional quantum liquids will be developed, bridging the gap between one-dimensional Luttinger liquids and three-dimensional Fermi liquids.The educational part of this award involves advising undergraduate students and the development of a new graduate course on the physics of ultracold atoms, which will span a wide range of topics in conventional atomic and molecular optics, condensed matter physics, and quantum optics. Such a course will integrate PI's research program and his educational activities, and will contribute to the training of future leaders in this rapidly developing line of research.  The outreach component of this award will take advantage of PI's extensive experience in organizing physics contests and coaching high school students for the Physics Olympiads during his college years.   The PI will develop an open-access website with a collection of online instruction materials for use by high-school teachers and students.  The website will focus on preparing talented high-school students for Physics Olympiads. Such effort will also take advantage of Rice University's unique location to reach underrepresented and minority students. NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis CAREER award supports theoretical research aimed at understanding the properties of systems of interacting electrons and atoms in confined geometries at very low temperatures, a regime where quantum mechanics plays a major role. When the motion of these quantum particles is spatially confined, their collective behavior changes drastically compared to their bulk form which is described relatively well by conventional theories.  The resulting motion of the constituent particles is strongly correlated.  The PI will focus on understanding general dynamical properties of such strongly correlated systems, in particular when they are driven out of equilibrium.  To achieve this goal, the PI will adopt a strategy of investigating particular systems in connection with current experiments and focus on calculating concrete observable quantities and making predictions that can be verified in laboratories. Successful implementation of the research project will significantly advance our fundamental understanding of strongly correlated phenomena and will be of importance to current experimental efforts on systems of dimensions that are some millionth the size of the human hair and/or systems confined in some of the spatial dimensions.  In the long run, the research supported by this award may contribute to the development of new devices for high-precision measurements at the quantum level, spin-dependent transport and electronics, and quantum computation.

459,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY This research project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) Program in the Division of Materials Research, National Science Foundation aims to study kinetically-controlled syntheses of anisotropic gold nanostructures and their colloidal crystallization in aqueous media. While numerous 3D crystals of spherical particles are known, there are no analogous systems composed of rod-like building blocks. This is because nearly all existing syntheses of nanorods cannot control their length, which often makes them unsuitable for long range 3D crystallization. Seed-mediated synthesis of gold nanorods is a rare example of the reaction producing rods that are fairly well-defined in terms of their length. However, this method is currently non-scalable and cannot offer a sufficient quantity of nanorods to conduct a comprehensive study of their crystallization. This project will develop a route that can scale the synthesis up to four orders of magnitude. The key of the proposed approach is based on uniform amplification of preformed nanorods by reducing residual gold ions on their surface. Preliminary findings show that this goal can be achieved if the rate of reduction is very low, which allows for complete suppression of random nucleation events. Once the large quantities of near-monodisperse nanorods are produced, their crystallization into 3D single crystals will be systematically studied. The project will determine the role of various parameters such as size distribution and purity of rods, their interaction with the underlying substrates, and the rate of solvent evaporation. Of particular importance will be the role of CTAB surfactant that must be present in solution during crystallization. When the best combination of structural and physical variables is identified, periodic arrays of colloidal single crystals will be assembled on lithographically patterned substrates. Measurements of optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of crystals along and perpendicular to the axes of nanorods will be performed in order to assess their direction-dependent vectorial nature.NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY Significant interest in gold nanoparticles with controlled shapes has grown dramatically in the past decade. However, they are often too difficult to make and/or purify. The current commercial price of gold nanorods is more than 7,000 times the price of bulk gold. Therefore, a development of more efficient large-scale synthesis will resolve the issue of their accessibility, which is the main bottleneck of their real-life applications in anticancer therapy, military devices, and invisible cloak technology. Better understanding of mechanisms that govern the assembly of non-spherical particles into large crystals will offer novel types of nanomaterials with direction-dependent properties. The new scientific knowledge generated in the course of this project will be widely disseminated via information sharing techniques and Web2.0 communications. Video materials containing a detailed demonstration of the synthesis of gold nanorods and real-time imaging of 3D crystals by optical and electron microscopy will be posted on the YouTube and Rice University web sites. Of particular importance will be the interactions with science teachers from local middle schools that have a large population of minority students. The PI and his graduate students will use their extensive experience with molecular graphics for 3D visualization of nanostructures and colloidal assemblies in order to create a unique type of activity in Houston public schools that currently collaborate with Rice University. In addition, an exciting outreach activity is planned at the intersection of science and art, which will involve collaborative interactions with the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. aqueous; Arts; base; cancer therapy; Chemistry; Communication; Crystallization; Development; Devices; Electron Microscopy; evaporation; Event; experience; fine art; Foundations; Goals; Gold; graduate student; hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide; Image; Imagery; interest; Ions; junior high school; Knowledge; Length; Life; Measurement; Mechanics; Mediating; Methods; middle school; Military Personnel; Minority; Molecular; Museums; nanomaterials; nanoparticle; nanorod; Nanostructures; Nature; novel; Optics; outreach; particle; Pattern; Population; Price; programs; Property; Reaction; Research; Research Project Grants; Residual state; Rice; Role; Route; Schools; Science; Seeds; Shapes; solid state; Solutions; Solvents; Students; Surface; surfactant; System; teacher; Techniques; Technology; Time; Universities; web siteLARGE SCALE SYNTHESIS OF NEAR-MONODISPERSE GOLD NANORODS AND THEIR ASSEMBLY INTO 3D ANISOTROPIC SINGLE CRYSTALS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,3.651835757053523e-05,1e-06

462,"PI: Aaron P. Smith (Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College)Co-PI: Niranjan Baisakh (Louisiana State University Agricultural Center)Rice is a staple crop that feeds more than two billion people worldwide. Agricultural lands used for growing rice frequently contain sub-optimal nutrient levels. Low availability of two important nutrients, phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe), commonly limits crop productivity, whereas excess Fe can cause toxicity in rice grown under flooding conditions. Because of these growth restraints, plants modulate complex responses to fluctuating P and Fe levels via genome-wide transcriptional regulatory networks that involve numerous genes. DNA is found in the nucleus wrapped around histone proteins into structures known as nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin, which is a fluid, higher-order assembly that is modified by many remodeling complexes. Although chromatin structure plays a substantial role in controlling gene expression, the chromatin-level mechanisms involved in regulating nutrient homeostasis in plants are not well understood. Previous work has shown that the interaction between P and Fe influences the onset of deficiency-induced stress responses. The goal of this project is to identify chromatin-level mechanisms that regulate the uptake, assimilation, and utilization of P and Fe in rice. The four specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine the physiological and transcriptional changes in rice seedlings under P and/or Fe deficiency; 2) identify nutrient deficiency-dependent changes in nucleosome positioning across the rice genome; 3) examine the role of the H2A.Z histone variant in regulating gene expression in rice genome-wide; and 4) characterize the histone post-translational modifications present at rice P and Fe homeostasis genes during nutrient deficiency. By correlating three key components of chromatin structure (i.e. nucleosome positioning, histone variant localization, and histone modifications) with gene expression profiles, the regulatory mechanisms that modulate P and Fe deficiency responses will be revealed. Identifying these chromatin-level mechanisms will provide opportunities for developing crops with improved nutrient use-efficiency, significantly improving U.S. and global agriculture. All sequence data generated during this project will be made available to the public through the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).This project will contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate students. The investigators have research groups diverse in ethnicity and gender, and will continue to foster involvement of underrepresented groups in research by mentoring students through programs available through LSU, including the Pre-doctoral Scholars Institute and Noyce Tigers Research Internship. Other planned activities include K-12 outreach through the annual Super Science Saturday event, and training of student-teacher pairs from area high schools in hands-on research for two weeks during the summer. agricultural center; Agriculture; Area; Assimilations; biological adaptation to stress; Cell Nucleus; Chromatin; Chromatin Structure; college; Complex; Data; Databases; DNA; Event; Feeds; Floods; Fostering; Gender; Gene Expression; Genes; Genome; genome-wide; Goals; Graduate Education; Growth; Hand; high school; histone modification; Histones; Homeostasis; improved; Institutes; Internships; Iron; land use; Liquid substance; Louisiana; Mechanics; Mentors; Molecular Profiling; Nucleosomes; Nutrient; outreach; Phosphorus; Physiological; Plants; Play; Positioning Attribute; Post-Translational Protein Processing; pre-doctoral; Productivity; programs; Proteins; Research; Research Personnel; response; restraint; Rice; Role; Science; Seedling; Structure; Students; teacher; Tigers; Toxic effect; Training; Universities; uptake; Variant; WorkIDENTIFYING CHROMATIN-LEVEL MECHANISMS THAT REGULATE RESPONSES TO PHOSPHORUS- AND IRON-DEFICIENCIES IN RICE",0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.9997947441369782,1e-06,1e-06
463,"The usual state of affairs in nature is one of populations fluctuating around some trend or stable average. Occasionally, however, this scenario is interrupted by an abrupt shift to a dramatically different regime, as when the populations of many species suddenly jump to different abundances in synchrony in the open ocean. The obvious intuitive explanation for such changes in nature is the occurrence of a sudden large external impact. However, theoreticians have long stressed that this need not be the case. Even a tiny incremental change in conditions can trigger a large shift in some systems if a critical threshold known as  catastrophic bifurcation  is passed. Intuitively, this is like the tipping over of an overloaded boat when too many people move to one side. A question of interest is whether such tipping points also exist in actively managed ecosystems, like irrigated rice paddies.In spring 2011, a pilot study of traditional, small-scale irrigation systems (called subaks) on the Indonesian island of Bali produced the first empirical evidence for the presence of multiple regimes in an actively managed social-ecological system. One group of four subaks responded confidently to economic and environmental challenges, while a second group of four experienced a rapid decline. Subaks have existed on Bali since the eleventh century, but most are now at risk, and last year a thousand hectares of terraced fields went out of production. Signs that the subak system is under severe threat led to a proposal from the Government of Indonesia to create a UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Landscape to support the subaks.  For the World Heritage to succeed, it is vital to understand what causes subaks to tip from one regime to another. This project will train Indonesian researchers to use the new multi-scale analytical methods developed for the pilot study, to investigate tipping points in 23 subaks. This study will also evaluate the potential of the new methods for understanding critical transitions in other social-ecological systems. analytical method; Boat; Economics; Ecosystem; experience; Government; Indonesia; interest; Irrigation; Island; Methods; Nature; Oceans; Pilot Projects; Population; Production; Research Personnel; Rice; Risk; Side; social; Stress; System; Training; trend; UNESCORAPID: CRITICAL TRANSITIONS IN AT-RISK BALINESE SUBAKS",1e-06,1e-06,0.9983924660037071,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999

BéninSweet potato is among the most important food crops in the world and an extremely important food crop for subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is grown throughout the African continent and currently around 34.5% of global sweet potato area is in Africa. One major limitation in sweet potato production is cultivar decline, mostly due to the cumulative effect of virus infection on this vegetatively propagated crop. Thus, viral diseases are considered a major limiting factor in sweet potato production worldwide, and particularly in SSA. The objective of this project is to evaluate a novel approach, deep sequencing of small RNAs from field-grown sweet potato samples collected throughout Africa, to systematically and efficiently identify known and novel virus genome sequences. A total of around 1750 geo-referenced field-grown samples of sweet potato will be collected from more than ten countries in Africa. Small RNA populations of these samples will be prepared and sequenced using high throughput next-generation sequencing technology, and then assembled to identify known and novel sweet potatoviruses.Broader Impacts: Food security remains a huge challenge for millions of Africans, particularly for those in sub-Saharan regions, who depend on agriculture for their subsistence. Emerging and reemerging pathogens, including many viruses, continue to cause devastating losses of food production in Africa. Current knowledge of crop viruses in Africa is limited and sporadic at best. Novel virus genome identification technology through deep sequencing of small RNA population is potentially applicable to continental surveys as its efficiency in virus identification has been proven with both greenhouse and field grown samples. This technology can then be applied to systematically determine the total virus genome sequences (virome) on a number of other major crop plants in Africa such as maize, rice, tomato, bean, and cassava. Public availability of such information will provide the scientific community and government unprecedented possibilities to understand crop virus distribution in Africa, guide phytosanitary requirements, predict risks of future epidemics, and suggest regional disease management strategies. Data generated under this project will be disseminated through the project website (accessible via http://bti.cornell.edu/ZhangjunFei.php) and raw and processed small RNA sequences will also be available through EBI Sequence Read Archive and NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, respectively.

466,"Over 10,000 species of grasses are known to science.  Grasses proliferated rapidly, obscuring their historical relationships.  This project integrates three broad approaches in a study of grass diversification using contemporary methods to reconstruct the genealogy of the grasses.  Next generation DNA sequencing methods will be used to determine complete chloroplast genomes and subregions of the nuclear genome from at least 100 species.  Bioinformatics analyses will explore patterns and rates of DNA sequence evolution.  Studies of development, especially in leaves, will be used to test whether particular adaptations are correlated with historical migrations into new habitats.

469,"Archaeological survey and excavation at the ancient Swahili stonetown of Songo Mnara will enable the exploration of aspects of ancient urban planning in coastal East Africa. Dr Jeffrey Fleisher (Rice University) and Dr Stephanie Wynne-Jones (University of York) will lead an international team of specialists from the U.S., U.K., and Tanzania in the investigation of economic and ritual activities at Songo Mnara and of how they related to planned and unplanned parts of the town. Support from the National Science Foundation in collaboration with the Arts and Humanities Research Council in the United Kingdom, allows for three seasons of fieldwork at this site on the southern Tanzanian coast. Swahili stonetowns, found along the eastern African coast, were the home to an indigenous and cosmopolitan form of urbanism that linked Africa with the Indian Ocean world system from AD 700 to 1500. A World Heritage Site, Songo Mnara is recognized as the most impressive of all Swahili townscapes, including more than 40 coral-built houses and room-blocks, 5 mosques and multiple cemeteries.  Occupation of the site was brief, from the 14th to 16th centuries AD, coinciding with the golden age of Swahili towns along the coast, and particularly at its neighboring site of Kilwa Kisiwani.This work will contribute substantially to discussions of organizational principles in ancient town plans more generally, and to research on aspects of town layouts that were formed by movement, activity and use, rather than formal planning from above.  By exploring the way the actions of people both shaped and were shaped by town plans, this study will provide a holistic case study that addresses current concerns with the plans and spatial practices of ancient complex societies.  The fieldwork will explore the urban space of Songo Mnara at four interlinked scales: (1) household activities through excavations within and around buildings; (2) public and communal practices in the open areas and monuments of the site; (3) the site plan will be accurately plotted; and (4) the site will be positioned within its broader island landscape. The exceptional preservation at Songo Mnara allows the construction of a robust dataset to explore how Swahili towns were both planned and unplanned.  This will offer insight into the multiple ways that towns plans emerged - through the efforts of powerful people, but also through the more basic and daily acts of those living in and moving through the town.  Broader impacts of the project include important training for American, British, and Tanzanian students, both graduate and undergraduate.  Additionally, the project contributes to the preservation and conservation of Songo Mnara, which remains an  endangered  World Heritage Site.  A long term commitment to archaeological research at the site will provide important opportunities for community involvement, and educational opportunities to demonstrate the unique role that archaeology can play in its preservation and documentation.

470,"This REU site engages 11 undergraduate students in the key elements of research on sustainable land and water resources that are essential to improving management practices, with a focus on the interdisciplinary nature of this research. Students work on one of three teams on projects that integrate the Earth-surface dynamics, geology, ecology, limnology and paleolimnology, and hydrology principles and techniques required for sustainable land and water management and restoration.  They will use an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods. One team will focus on stream restoration-related experimental work at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, one team will examine the effects of surface water management practice on groundwater resources in Montana, and one team will investigate paleolimnology and current habitat conditions of wild rice lakes in northern Minnesota. An All-Team Gathering at the conclusion of the program will expose all students to laboratory experiments at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory and include an ethics program that considers student research in the context of the community. Global climate change and associated impacts on our national waterways has led to new pressures for the development of excellence in land and water resource management. This is true to an even greater extent on Native American reservations; which deal with complicated resource management issues and lack young Native American scientists to meet current needs. Both researchers and practitioners need, now more than ever, to understand physical and ecological processes in quantitative ways that form a firm foundation for predictive approaches to resource management. Through participation in one of three teams, all students leave this REU with a robust understanding of the quantitative predictive research and management approach critical to sustainability of land and water resources. Students from groups underrepresented in the Earth sciences are the major focus of our recruiting efforts, and will comprise at least 75% of the students in the program. In addition, students will be prepared for careers in land and water resource management in the U.S. in general, and specifically related to Native American reservations. career; climate change; Communities; Development; Ecology; Elements; Ethics; experience; falls; Foundations; Geology; Habitats; hydrology; improved; Indian reservation; Laboratories; Left; meetings; Methods; Minnesota; Montana; Native Americans; Nature; Practice Management; pressure; Process; programs; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Personnel; research study; Resources; restoration; Rice; Science; Scientist; Site; Stream; Students; Surface; Techniques; Water; WorkRESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATES SITE ON SUSTAINABLE LAND AND WATER RESOURCES",0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,2.3921947847187e-06
471,"PI:  Venkatesan Sundaresan (University of California-Davis)Co-PI: Scott D. Russell (University of Oklahoma-Norman)Collaborator: Clarence Hedge (Langston University)Plants reproduce through pollination and fertilization, resulting in the fusion of an egg cell and a sperm cell to generate a single cell called a zygote.  The zygote divides and grows to form an embryo inside the seed, which after germination gives rise to the entire adult plant. Thus, the zygote is a totipotent cell, with the capacity to regenerate all the tissues and organs of a plant.  The growth of the zygote and the early embryo is initially dependent upon maternal factors provided by the egg cell. As the embryo develops, it later becomes independent of these maternal factors and relies only upon embryonically synthesized RNAs and proteins. The transition from the fertilized egg, reliant on maternal gene products, to independent growth controlled by embryonic genes and gene products, is called the Zygotic transition. During this transition, extensive changes occur to the zygotic genome: the DNA in the chromosomes is re-packaged, genes are activated in the zygotic nucleus, and the maternally-supplied RNA is removed. The Zygotic transition is therefore a landmark event in the life-cycle of a plant.  Due to the small size and inaccessibility of the plant zygote, very little is currently known about this fundamental transition.  This project will address the problem by utilizing recent advances in genomics to exploit advantageous features of rice plants. In rice, the time from pollination to fertilization is one of the shortest of all flowering plants, and dissection of zygotes at precisely defined stages of development is feasible. The project will determine on a genome scale the changes in gene expression as the zygote progresses from fertilized egg to the first embryonic division, and gain insights into gene networks that underlie this transition.  It is known that expression of many genes during seed development depends upon the parent-of-origin, i.e. expression of maternally-inherited and paternally-inherited genes are different, due to modifications of the DNA or its packaging called epigenetic changes.  The project will evaluate individual contributions of the paternal and maternal genomes of the zygote in crosses between two different rice strains, to determine the extent of parent-of-origin effects on zygotic transcription, and genes that show such effects will be characterized for the nature of their epigenetic modifications.  The zygote is a critical transition in the plant life cycle, when the genome is reprogrammed for the initiation of a new diploid generation that arises from this one cell.  This project will therefore be addressing a significant gap in the understanding of plant reproduction.Understanding of the zygotic transition in embryos has agricultural applications for increased seed yields, for regeneration of plants from tissue culture, and for improved methods of breeding hybrids. The project will focus on rice, one of the most important food crops in the world, and also a major crop in many states of the USA.  The project findings should also be applicable to other crops, especially cereals.  For this purpose, the data generated by the project will be made available for wide access through public databases such as GenBank and Gramene, and the analysis through a publicly-accessible project website at the University of California-Davis.  Additionally, the project will provide training in plant genomics to students and faculty from Langston University, a historically African-American institution, through summer internships at the University of Oklahoma, and at the University of California-Davis. The project will also provide training for undergraduate students and graduate students at University of Oklahoma, and for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows at the University of California-Davis.

472,"Under the supervision of Dr. Adria LaViolette, Jack Stoetzel will conduct an archaeological investigation to reconstruct the relationship between Swahili people and coastal ecosystems between A.D. 600 and 1600. Swahili identity emerged along the coast of tropical East Africa during the first- millennium A.D. and is predicated on a cosmopolitan worldview that includes an openness to engage with external material cultures and ideologies. Physical evidence of the cosmopolitan worldview characteristic of Swahili identity includes the adoption of rice agriculture, integration into the Indian Ocean commercial system, and conversion to Islam. This project treats archaeological plant remains as indicators of past ecological ecosystems. Two types of plant residues will be considered in this research: (a) microscopic phytolith remains which are to be used to reconstruct species composition of botanical communities through time; and (b) visible charcoal remains which will be analyzed to identify cultural use and preference of particular plant species recovered in a range of archaeological contexts.Understanding of Swahili influence on environmental change along tropical coastlines that will result from this project will insert East Africa into the burgeoning discussion of coastal resource management. The research will provide insight into the relationship between a Muslim society and the ecosystems it occupied.  The project will help explain contemporary ecological conditions and create the opportunity to model effects of current and future social activity throughout the region. This research therefore has the potential to inform future environmental legislation mandates throughout coastal East Africa.Swahili archaeology has largely overlooked the potential that environmental archaeology can have in reconstructing past lifestyles across the region. When evoking environmental conditions, previous researchers situate Swahili within contemporary conditions or quote historic documents. By acknowledging that human actions influence environmental conditions, this research has the potential to situate Swahili actions within ecological contexts they experienced as well as track the effects such decisions had on plant communities through time. In order to achieve this result, the project combines theories from both household archaeology and environmental archaeology. In order to achieve the goals of this research, a comparative collection must be created that represents microscopic phytolith and charcoal specimen available across the Swahili coast. The time and financial investment which this research program must undertake to create a comparative collection will be rewarded by the development of an online database that will feature digital photographs, descriptions, and names of unique shapes identified in both phytoliths and charcoal wood- grain. African scholars and those otherwise interested in the area will benefit from the database because the collection reduces start- up costs and time investment necessary to research archaeological plant remains throughout tropical East Africa.

473,"Gustavo Scuseria of Rice University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for research to develop accurate approaches for describing strong (also known as static or non-dynamical) correlations in electronic structure theory.  More than eighty years after the formulation of Schrodinger's equation, computational quantum chemistry has matured considerably, yet there remain formidable challenges to describing the electronic structure of many molecules and solids. When near or exact degeneracies are present, the single determinant picture breaks down and a description of strong correlation due to these degeneracies becomes crucial for even a qualitative description of the electronic structure. Addressing emergent electronic phenomena in chemistry, biology, and materials science requires calculations with significantly large active spaces, necessitating the development of alternative, more efficient descriptions of static correlation. The focus of this proposal is a method known as Constrained-Pairing Mean-Field Theory or CPMFT. The work is expected to significantly enhance our ability to model from first-principles the behavior of electrons in molecules and solids, resulting in better understanding and prediction of materials properties and chemical reactions. Many of the tools developed in the PI's group are widely used in academia, national laboratories, and industry. The current work is expected to have an equally broad impact and to contribute to the training of students at all levels.

474,"Proposal No: 048558 PI name: Massoud, Yehia Inst.: William Marsh Rice Univ Title: Integrated Automation Strategy for Interconnect Design: A New Paradigm for Mixed-Signal Nanoscale Integrated CircuitsAbstractDue to aggressive technology scaling and increasing operating frequencies, interconnect has become the main performance limiting factor in integrated circuits.  Consequently, interconnect synthesis plays a vital role in facilitating today's mixed-signal designs, but current design automation techniques fail to include deep sub-micron interconnect effects directly into the synthesis process, resulting in costly redesign.  To promote synthesis strategies that handle the increased complexity of mixed-signal nanoscale integrated circuits, the PI proposes a new interconnect synthesis paradigm that evaluates the circuit signal integrity and performance during interconnect synthesis.  Under this new paradigm, interconnect in mixed-signal systems is modeled, optimized and synthesized taking all aspects of the system's interconnect into account.  This includes analog interconnect structures and integrated components as well as interconnect in digital portions of the design.  To facilitate and develop our new system-oriented interconnect synthesis paradigm for mixed-signal nanoscale ICs, the PI will research and create: (i) analytical modeling, optimization and synthesis methodologies that facilitate generalized design automation in integrated mixed-signal and system-on-chip designs; (ii) system-oriented interconnect synthesis strategies utilizing statistical modeling methodologies incorporating inductance to produce layout that meets design constraints. To further prepare students for mixed-signal interconnect design, the PI will employ dynamically changing computer engineering curriculum in both his graduate class, which utilizes innovative semester-long projects emphasizing original research, and his undergraduate class, which stresses the fundamentals of the VLSI design process and provides students with an intuitive understanding of critical concepts. abstracting; Accounting; analog; Automation; Computers; design; digital; Educational Curriculum; Engineering; innovation; meetings; Methodology; Modeling; Names; nanoscale; Performance; Play; Process; Research; Rice; Role; Signal Transduction; Statistical Models; Stress; Structure; Students; submicron; System; Techniques; TechnologyCAREER: INTEGRATED AUTOMATION STRATEGY FOR INTERCONNECT DESIGN: A NEW PARADIGM FOR MIXED-SIGNAL NANOSCALE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.0001600338961796754
475,"Rice University will lead an initiative of major southwestern research universities; Rice, the University of Texas-Austin, the University of New Mexico, The University of Arizona, the University of Houston, and Texas Tech University along with the states; partnering minority-serving institutions (MSI);to plan a next-generation alliance with the mission to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students who pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) Ph.D.s and subsequently enter academic positions. Concentrated in the southwest is the nation's growing Hispanic population, Native Americans, and primarily in its cities, a significant number of African Americans. Schools in the southwest must increase participation to serve the needs of this citizenry. The participating universities can make a difference. They represent thousands of URM STEM undergraduates. Key participating faculty and administrators also provide experience and expertise that will be shared across the alliance. For instance, Arizona, New Mexico and Rice U have faculty members who are former Rice AGEP graduate students. The proposed project leadership has learned much from its eleven years of AGEP participation, and this knowledge will inform the work of this next-generation alliance, including a) it needs to do a better job of systematically motivating and inspiring URM undergraduates at research universities to pursue graduate studies, b) it needs to more fully and systematically engage faculty members, critical to the success of the program, for functions such as evaluating graduate admissions, mentoring, role models, academic graduate advising, selecting research advisors, advocating for post-doc and faculty placement, to name a few, c) it needs a systematic way to produce new faculty members, for most, through a post-doctoral fellowship, d) it needs to integrate the broadening participation effort more fully into the mainstream research, and e) it needs a more systematic way of defining participation in the AGEP program so that it is indeed increasing participation of the nation's URM population rather than merely increasing international minority participation. Alliance planning will be led by Rice University. Rice will begin this one year project by hosting an in-person meeting of participants from all universities to build understanding around a common vision and organize committees to continue planning from a distance. Subsequently, cross-institutional committees formed around strategic topics will meet weekly through teleconferences. Committee chairs will also meet weekly with the Project Director. To facilitate the planning, each committee will have staff support, and access to technologies that support distant collaboration. In addition to crafting a new alliance plan, the project will share through a report what is learned through this collaborative activity and disseminate it broadly. Intellectual Merit: This project will bring together many of the nation's leaders in the area of diversity to develop a next-generation AGEP --one that is focused strategically on producing URM faculty leaders. It builds on a base of experience and builds towards new understandings and efforts. Broader Impacts: No population is more critical to the health of the nation than that of the southwest, with its concentration of a growing Hispanic population, Native Americans, and concentrated in its cities, a significant number of African Americans, and because of this growth, none provides greater potential.

477,"Dr. Julia Comerford is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Texas at Austin. A wealth of observations have shown that galaxy mergers are common and that nearly all galaxies host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH); consequently, some galaxies must host two SMBHs as the result of recent mergers. The two SMBHs are known as  dual SMBHs  for the first ~100 Myr after the merger when they are at separations >1 kpc. These dual SMBHs have significant potential as probes of galaxy evolution, as they are observational tracers of galaxy mergers, the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy mergers, and SMBH mergers. However, the full potential of dual SMBHs for studies of these topics has not yet been realized, due to the small number of known dual-SMBH systems. Dr. Comerford proposes to use optical spectroscopy to increase the number of known dual SMBHs several folds and build a statistical catalog of 0 Dr. Comerford will also teach science communication workshops for astronomy undergraduates to increase the students' effectiveness in communicating to the general public and to the astronomical community. Undergraduate workshop participants will share their research experiences with minority high school students at Eastside Memorial High School in Austin.

478,"Rice University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Texas at Austin are awarded collaborative grants to develop and implement algorithms and software tools for the analysis of gene genealogies and inference of species phylogenies from them. A gene genealogy, also known as gene tree, models how genes replicate and get transmitted from one generation to the next during evolution. A species phylogeny models how species arise and diverge. A species phylogeny is traditionally inferred by a three-step process: (1) a genomic region from the set of species under study is sequenced; (2) a  gene tree  is inferred for the genomic region; and, (3) the gene tree is declared to be the species tree. However, recent evolutionary genomic analyses of various groups of organisms have demonstrated that different genomic regions may have evolutionary histories that disagree with each other as well as with that of the species. Further, evolutionary processes such as horizontal gene transfer, result in network-like, rather than tree-like, species phylogenies. This joint project will develop accurate computational methods for determining the causes of gene tree discordance, and inferring species phylogenies (trees as well as networks) from gene trees despite their discordance. Special emphasis will be put on the efficiency of the methods so that they allow for analysis of genome-scale data sets. All methods will be implemented and extensively tested for performance. All methods developed will be made publicly available in software packages that we have been developing in the respective groups. The material will be integrated into courses that the PIs regularly teach at their respective institutions.

This joint project will develop accurate computational methods for determining the causes of gene tree discordance, and inferring species phylogenies (trees as well as networks) from gene trees despite their discordance. Special emphasis will be put on the efficiency of the methods so that they allow for analysis of genome-scale data sets. All methods will be implemented and extensively tested for performance. All methods developed will be made publicly available in software packages that we have been developing in the respective groups. The material will be integrated into courses that the PIs regularly teach at their respective institutions. Last but not least, the project will culminate with a two-day workshop, open to students and post-doctoral fellows from around the country, with presentations by the investigators on the methodologies developed, as well as hands-on tutorials on using the tools in analyzing data.

481,"The research is a study of dynamical properties of translation flows on flat surfaces, with a special emphasis on connections with probability theory. In previously funded work, the proposer has obtained new limit theorems for translation flows. These results give a completely new type of limit theorems in ergodic theory and open a wide array of questions. The proposer will continue his study of limit distributions for translation flows. An important particular case is that of flows along stable foliations of pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms.A specific tool essential for this study is the symbolic coding, developed and studied by the proposer, of translation flows as suspension flows over Vershik automorphisms, a construction developing earlier work of S.Ito. Strongly chaotic, hyperbolic behavior of the Teichmueller flow controls the mildly chaotic, parabolic behavior of translation flows.In the second, more geometric, part of the project, the proposer will continue his investigation of the chaotic properties of the Teichmueller geodesic flow.We see chaotic behavior in the evolution of stock prices, weather patterns, turbulent fluids and traffic jams. How to control chaotic behavior? A key role in our modern perception of chaos is played by the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. The proposed research studies the slow chaos for flows on surfaces, a central class of examples in geometry and physics. The project also has an important pedagogical component. Through lectures by visiting scholars, working seminars and reading projects related to the proposal, the proposer will continue involving Rice undergraduate and graduate students in Mathematical research.

482,"The proposing team will quantify the role of writhing motions in coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar filament eruptions and examine the role such motions might play in either initiating the eruption or modifying its subsequent evolution. This is motivated by recent work by the principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators that supports the idea that writhe of the filament axis is a possible driver of filament eruptions and could define the nature of the eruption. In their analysis, the proposing team will use high cadence, ground-based observations from the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) in Hawaii and Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) in California, along with data from several spacecraft. MLSO instrumentation, in particular, will allow for Doppler velocity discrimination and provide a unique diagnostic capability for determining writhing motions in conjunction with intensity data. The expected results should improve our understanding of the initiation of CME eruptions and provide the necessary input for accurate modeling of the initiation and evolution of CMEs.This research will directly support the development and mentoring of young scientists and graduate students, and will contribute to at least one PhD thesis. The results of this research will also be incorporated into the PI's undergraduate lecture courses at Rice University, and will provide a basis for student research opportunities through Rice's undergraduate research program. The PI will also make use of Rice's  Century Scholars  program (which partners faculty as mentors for top-tier freshmen) to recruit two new Scholars (with his recruiting focus on under-represented student populations). The proposers will provide public outreach opportunities by inclusion of their science results into the  Solar Week  educational web site at http://www.solarweek.org, which was created by the PI to encourage middle school girls to pursue careers in science. base; California; career; Data; Development; Diagnostic; Doctor of Philosophy; Evolution; Faculty; Filament; girls; graduate student; Hawaii; improved; instrumentation; junior high school; lectures; Loa; Mentors; middle school; Modeling; Motion; Nature; NCI Scholars Program; outreach; Play; Population; Principal Investigator; programs; Recruitment Activity; Research; Rice; Role; Science; Scientist; Spacecraft; Students; Universities; Ursidae Family; web site; WorkSHINE: DETERMINING THE ROLE OF IDEAL INSTABILITIES IN THE INITIATION OF CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES) THROUGH MULTIWAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06

484,"There is a clear need to increase crop productivity to feed our growing population. The enzyme RuBisCO is critical for the fixation of carbon dioxide into sugars in all plants, but its low efficiency makes it a major bottleneck in photosynthesis. To compensate for RuBisCO's low efficiency, plants with a photosynthetic process known as  C-3  (such as rice and wheat) devote a large fraction of their resources to producing the RuBisCO protein, which constitutes up to 50% of the total protein in their leaves. Unlike C3 plants, many algae have developed a means to drastically reduce the amounts of RuBisCO protein needed for efficient photosynthesis, by using a biophysical carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). The CCM increases the carbon dioxide concentration within a subcellular compartment called the pyrenoid where RuBisCO is located, thus enhancing carbon dioxide assimilation with less RuBisCO protein.The ambitious goal of this program is to transfer the CCM from the green alga Chlamydomonas to the model C3 plant Arabidopsis, thus improving rates of carbon dioxide assimilation. The program will use a cutting-edge genome-wide screen to discover novel components of the algal CCM, including pyrenoid components. The physiological functions, localizations and physical interactions of known and newly-discovered components will be characterized by molecular and cell biological approaches, including electron microscopy and mass spectrometry. A modified RuBisCO will be developed and inserted into Arabidopsis to enable formation of a pyrenoid-like organelle. Known components and, progressively, key newly-discovered components, will be transferred to Arabidopsis and their impact on photosynthesis will be assessed. The process will be guided and supported by the development of advanced computational models.This transformative program represents a leap forward towards improving the photosynthetic efficiency of C3 crop plants, by introduction of a biophysical CCM from green algae. Additionally, the research will provide a much clearer molecular definition of the algal CCM, which is a fundamentally important yet poorly understood biological process. The research will provide undergraduate students opportunities to learn from a broad base of biological research.

485,"INTELLECTUAL MERIT  ABC (ATP binding cassette ) proteins represent a gene family that has greatly expanded in plants, with twice as many members in Arabidopsis and rice (over 120) as any other sequenced genome of a multicellular organism (eg. human, worm, fly). The reason behind the expansion of this family in plants is unknown but hints to kingdom specific evolutionary constraints.  This project focuses on the Arabidopsis ABC protein, Atwbc19 (ABCG19), a member of a plant-specific clade.  Atwbc19 confers antibiotic resistance but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Preliminary results suggest that Atwbc19 does not function as a transporter but as a translational regulator. Thus the goal of this project is to demonstrate cleavage of Atwbc19 resulting in a soluble ABC protein, confirm its association with the translation apparatus and identify regulated transcripts. Ultimately, a new paradigm for antibiotic resistance in plants may be established.BROADER IMPACT The project has three educational objectives. First, long term research opportunities will be provided to undergraduates.  Second, a research based course will be developed. And finally, research experiences will be provided in the traditional classroom through an upper level Plant Biology course. Overall, the project will contribute to the strategic goal of the College to increase student participation in research or internships from 30% to 100% by 2015. At the departmental level, the project will contribute to a curriculum that is being significantly revised towards a stronger emphasis on linking research to teaching. Ultimately, one goal is to inspire African American female students to engage in intellectual and personal development that leads them to Graduate School.

486,"Photorespiration can account for yield losses of 25-50% in C3 plants, which include rice, wheat and soybean, three of the top four crops in terms of global grain production.  Photorespiration occurs because oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) compete for the same acceptor molecule in photosynthesis.  The process can be very simply inhibited by increasing the concentration of CO2.  When CO2 is increased artificially  in greenhouses or in open fields, very significant yield increases are obtained.  However, artificially elevating CO2 over millions of acres of fields is not feasible.  Some cyanobacteria solve this problem by confining the fixation of carbon to a structure termed a carboxysome, where localization of specific enzymes cause a concentration of CO2.  Although chloroplasts, which contain the photosynthetic machinery of crops, lack carboxysomes, they evolved from cyanobacteria, which were symbiotically recruited into the ancestors of todays plants and crops.  This research project will provide the foundation for a synthetic biology approach in which carboxysomes will be engineered into the chloroplasts of crop plants to enhance photosynthesis.  Optimization will involve manipulating a model plant that is readily transformable and the development of an in silico model of the system to evaluate the use of different proteins and the minimal system that is needed.   A multidisciplinary approach will be implemented through collaboration of four research groups, each contributing complementary expertise: carboxysome genetics and assembly (Berkeley), chloroplast and nuclear transformation (Cornell), photosynthetic systems modelling (Illinois) and physiological and biochemical characterization of the whole plant (Rothamsted, Cornell and Illinois).

Wessler (University of California - Riverside)CoPIs: Thomas Brutnell (Boyce Thompson Institute), Jason Stajich (University of California - Riverside) and Qi Sun (Cornell University)Senior Personnel:  Joyce Van Eck (Boyce Thompson Institute), James Burnette (University of California - Riverside), Wen-Gui Yan (USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center) and Yutaka Okumoto (Kyoto University)The overall goal of this project is to understand the impact of a rapidly amplifying high copy number transposable element (TE) called mPing on generating diversity in rice. This goal has both applied and basic aspects. The applied goal is to develop and make freely available novel collections of reverse genetic resources that will be characterized from genome to transcriptome to phenome. The basic goal is to analyze for the first time how a high copy TE rapidly diversifies the genome of an organism and, in doing so, alters its ability to respond to a changing environment. It is paradoxical that rice, with the most stable genome among characterized crop plants, is host to the most active TE characterized in any eukaryote.  This fortunate set of circumstances will facilitate the application of next generation sequencing methodologies to sequence related rice cultivars and survey global changes in gene expression associated with abiotic stress responses. To this end the project will resequence five closely related rice strains where mPing has amplified to over 1000 copies during the past century and where it is still actively transposing. Comparison with the closely related reference genome Nipponbare will document for the first time the global impact of independent TE bursts in any organism. To assess the consequences of mPing insertion(s) on quantitative traits, the project will exploit recombinant inbred (RI) populations where the parents vary widely in their copy number of mPing insertions and where significant phenotypic variation exists for many traits.  The contribution of candidate genes with mPing insertions to phenotypic variation will be assayed in transgenic rice. To exploit the full range of mPing amplification, from very low to very high, the project will activate mPing in US cultivars and create up to 1500 lines carrying novel mPing insertions through a non-transgenic approach.  Finally, the project will use expression profiling (RNA-seq) to examine the role of mPing in reshaping the leaf transcriptome in response to abiotic stress.The expected broader impact of the project includes the development of novel collections of non-transgenic mPing-mutagenized rice strains that will be characterized from genome to transcriptome to phenome. All genomics data generated will be deposited at GenBank. Visualization of the datasets will be supported using in-house servers and at Gramene. All biological materials generated during the course of this project will be propagated at the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart (AR) and seed stocks of non-transgenic materials will be freely distributed through USDA-ARS Genetic Stocks - Oryza (GSOR) Collection. All outreach activities will be channeled through the PI's  The Dynamic Genome  courses, which will be taught in a newly constructed Science Learning Facility at the University of California - Riverside.  These courses, which are designed to replicate the PI's research laboratory, will serve as a conduit that integrates the research output of this project with the development of classroom modules for colleges and high schools focused on next generation sequencing methodologies.  As such, these courses will bring the excitement of next-generation technologies to undergraduates and high school students and teachers.  Finally, project involvement in the iPlant Collaborative's Education Outreach Team will facilitate the broader dissemination of successful modules.

490,"The Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing (CHM) is a leading research and education center for the development of precision and cost efficient process platforms and tools for the manufacturing of next generation, nanotechnology-enabled devices for electronics, energy conversion, resource conservation and human health.  The Center's approach involves the integration of components and systems across multiple length scales using novel nanofabrication processes for sub-30 nm elements based on directed self-assembly, additive-driven assembly, nanoimprint lithography, and conformal deposition at the nanoscale in combination with either Si wafer-based technologies or high-rate roll-to-roll based production tools.  The CHM effort is made comprehensive by research on device design, modeling and prototype testing in functional architectures that take advantage of the specific hierarchical nanomanufacturing capabilities developed by the Center.  The research structure consists of three Technical Research Groups (TRGs) and system-level test beds in which the key science, engineering and process barriers to the manufacturing of device nanostructures using the CHM platform tools are identified, systematically addressed and resolved. TRG 1, Nanoscale Materials and Processes, addresses the materials systems and processes necessary for high reliability nanofabrication and supports fundamental research on the CHM's core technologies. TRG 2, Nanoscale Devices, Systems, and Metrology, supports fundamental studies in magnetics, photonics and device design to generate proof-of-concept prototypes that can be assembled using advances from TRG 1 and the CHM's process platforms. TRG 3, Sensors and Environmental Monitoring, is creating new systems for on-chip separations, diagnostics and environmental monitoring. This includes new strategies for tracking nanomaterials in the environment and assessing their toxicity and biodistribution in plant and animal species. The test beds are the heart of process and platform development where promising concepts transition from laboratory results into reliable, rapid, high-yield and transferable methodologies.  CHM test beds include a unique a roll-to-roll process facility for self-assembled materials and devices, including custom coating lines for nanohybrid materials and roll-to-roll nanoimprint tools. Test bed demonstration projects include polymer batteries, flexible photovoltaics and nanoporous films for separations.  The CHM's fundamental science and test bed efforts incorporate faculty and research professionals at UMass Amherst, Binghamton University, MIT, The University of Michigan, Mount Holyoke College, NIST, The University of Puerto Rico, and Rice University and benefit from collaborations with leading groups in Europe and Asia. In terms of broader impacts, the implementation of efficient nanomanufacturing strategies that are compatible with Si wafer processing or high-volume roll-to-roll processing will enable the production of high performance computing, memory, sensing and photonic/optically active media and devices as well as nano-enabled products in energy conversion, organic electronics and displays at acceptable cost.  Such advances will help to transform our nation?s substantial investment in basic research into products that provide substantial social and economic benefits.  In addition, the CHM is the administrative hub of the National Nanomanufacturing Network (NNN).  The NNN is a catalyst for U.S. nanomanufacturing-based economic development and research collaboration.  It comprises a network of manufacturing facilities and expertise, a dynamic web-based information resource, and a pathway for university-industry-government partnerships.  The NNN efforts include InterNano, a freely accessible digital library and information resource on nanomanufacturing.  The NNN coordinates, hosts and distributes the outcome of workshops on emerging areas in nanotechnology research, implementation and societal implications.  The CHM further serves a broad educational audience, including those in K-12, community college, undergraduate and graduate schools, and the public.  The CHM's strategy focuses on training K-12 teachers in nanoscience curriculum, developing re-purposeable educational materials for various audiences and levels, piloting and disseminating nanomanufacturing and nanoscience educational content to community colleges, and enhancing undergraduate and graduate training in nanotechnology. The CHM champions the principle of diverse participation in all of its activities: research, education, outreach and management.

491,"Intellectual meritThe goal of this project is to discover mechanisms through which plants export nitrogen nutrients from leaves to the growing organs. This transport process is essential for optimal plant growth and health, as transport activity affects the accumulation of nutrients in edible parts of the plant, such as seeds and tubers. Grains used as feedstock are often low in protein and essential amino acids, which need to be supplemented at cost to the farmers. Reliance on a single staple food (maize, cassava, rice) is common in the developing world, and often leads to malnutrition because these plant organs are poor in protein and/or essential amino acids. Increasing the capacity of plants to export nitrogen nutrients to edible parts of the plant is expected to lead to more nutritious food containing more protein, and is hence a highly desirable trait. The team led by Okumoto has developed biosensors for glutamine, the amino acid plants mainly use for the export of nitrogen from leaves to edible parts. By using this sensor, the team aims at discovering genes responsible for glutamine export from plant cells. The discovered genes will further be analyzed by Pilot and Okumoto, whose expertise areas are in the transport process of plants. Selected genes will be used for creating plants that are more efficient in nitrogen transport to the storage organs.Broader ImpactsPlants are familiar to all of us as sources of food, fiber and fuel. Since the process of nitrogen export has an impact on plant growth, and their quality and quantity as food source, this is a great topic to stimulate the interest of high school students and engage them in early scientific research activities. Dolan is the principal investigator of the Partnership for Research and Education in Plants (supported by a Science Education Partnership Award from the National Center for Research Resources). Through this program, high school students conduct authentic scientific research by challenging Arabidopsis mutants with various treatments that have not been tested previously. Okumoto, Pilot and Dolan will collaborate with high school students to investigate the roles of genes discovered through this project. To increase diversity in the academic environment, undergraduate and graduate researchers from underrepresented groups will be recruited through the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program at Virginia Tech, with whom Okumoto has an established relationship as a participating mentor.

493,"Jacot1055942Current understanding of stem cell-derived heart tissue has primarily focused on embryonic stem cells, and, recently, induced pluripotent stem cells. These cell populations can form tumors, limiting their therapeutic use. Adult stem cells have shown little ability to differentiate into cardiac muscle. However, recent characterization of a population of amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSC) suggests that these cells have potential similar to embryonic stem cells, but do not form tumors, and some researchers consider AFSC to be the most promising therapeutic stem cells. However, AFSC behave differently than embryonic stem cells, particularly in heart tissue formation. AFSC have shown the potential to express cardiac marker proteins in laboratory studies, and have been shown to differentiate into contractile cells in coculture and animal studies, but laboratory differentiation into contractile cells has not been demonstrated. The differentiation of progenitor cells into functioning heart muscle requires a specific interplay of physical and chemical stimulation. Studies by this PI, as well as other groups, have demonstrated a link between physical cues, particularly substrate stiffness, fluid flow and electrical stimulation, and the maturation of heart muscle, though the effect on stem cell differentiation and the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly understood. This proposed study will investigate the effect of controlling the biophysical environment, and specifically substrate stiffness, fluid flow and electrical fields, on the differentiation of AFSC into heart cells and on the signaling pathways involved.The intellectual merit of this proposal is based on the hypothesis that the use of tuned substrate stiffness, fluid flow and electrical stimulation will produce a mature, functional cardiac phenotype in AFSC. To test this hypothesis, AFSC will be cultured in a series of rationally designed experimental conditions to quantify the effect of chemical protocols, alterations in substrate stiffness over a physiologic range, alterations in fluid flow in a range found in the developing heart, and chronic electrical pacing, as well as combinations of these factors. Expression heart protein markers and functional assays of calcium handling and cell contraction typical of heart tissue will be evaluated. Additionally, the effects of inhibiting certain pathways involved in sensing mechanical cues will be measured, and the activation of specific pathways shown to be involved in mechanical sensing will be quantified. Results will indicate the mechanism of mechanical sensing involved in AFSC response to substrate stiffness, fluid flow and electrical pacing and cooperative effects of these biophysical cues on differentiation into heart cells. In the long term, we envision a novel future therapy that allows collection of amniotic fluid by amniocentesis when a heart defect is detected prior to birth, growth of heart tissue in a laboratory setting, and surgical reconstruction of the newborn heart using functional tissue constructs created from the infants own cells. This technology could allow surgeons to consider transformative changes in heart reconstructions and pave the way for development of a total bioartificial heart.The broader educational and social impacts of this proposal are tightly integrated with the intellectual merit. Specifically, the proposed educational program is leveraged to engage a large number or elementary, middle and high school students in inquiry-based exploration of the cardiopulmonary system and inspire lifelong interest in science and medical technology.  Curricula will be developed in cooperation with the John P. McGovern Museum of Health and Medical Science (MMHM) in Houston to be used in field trips to the museum and teacher workshops, in presentations to local high schools, and in teaching Systems Physiology to Rice University undergraduates. The PI, Dr. Jacot, will also serve as a consultant on the planned expansion of the MMHM exhibitions, including a redesign of the Amazing Body exhibit with a large focus on the heart. Educational curricula will be posted to digital libraries and research results will be shared in peer-reviewed literature and at scientific conferences. adult stem cell; Amaze; Amniocentesis; Amniotic Fluid; amniotic fluid derived stem cell; Animals; base; Biological Assay; Birth; Calcium; Cardiac; cardiopulmonary system; Cells; Chemical Stimulation; Chemicals; Chronic; Coculture Techniques; Collection; Congenital Heart Defects; Cues; Development; Digital Libraries; Educational Curriculum; Educational process of instructing; Educational workshop; Electric Stimulation; embryonic stem cell; Environment; exhibitions; Exhibits; Experimental Designs; fluid flow; Future; Generations; Growth; Health; Heart; heart cell; high school; Human; induced pluripotent stem cell; Infant; interest; Laboratories; Laboratory Study; Link; Measures; Mechanics; Medical; Medical Technology; Museums; Myocardium; Newborn Infant; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Pathway interactions; Peer Review; Phenotype; Physiological; Physiology; Population; programs; Proteins; Protocols documentation; reconstruction; Research; Research Personnel; response; Review Literature; Rice; Science; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Social Impacts; stem cell differentiation; Stem cells; Students; Surgeon; symposium; System; teacher; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Uses; Tissues; tumor; UniversitiesCAREER: GENERATION OF CARDIAC TISSUE USING STEM CELLS DERIVED FROM HUMAN AMNIOTIC FLUID",0.999999,0.007444712472614246,2.903031068178394e-05,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06
494,"Doctoral student Yancey Orr (University of Arizona), under the supervision of Dr. J. Stephen Lansing, will research how differences in environmental knowledge emerge within highland Balinese communities in Indonesia. This research will focus on multiple levels of how people relate to and interact with their environment and in so doing address basic anthropological questions about the generation of knowledge from experience. Research will address topics such as how individuals understand ecological interactions, interpret the behavior of animals and visually perceive landscapes.  The researcher will use data collected from cognitive science experiments and interviews conducted among wet rice agriculturalists and craft producers.  This information will be used to see how directly experiencing the environment through labor and observation affects knowledge and skill.This research is important because it is a departure from existing studies of environmental knowledge which have typically focused on classification schemes which take linguistic groups as the unit of analysis.  Instead, the proposed research is aimed at uncovering the difference in environmental knowledge within communities and how people come to have such knowledge.  The research will contribute to cognitive science research on mental models and their development. Beyond addressing questions within anthropology, this research has practical application for Bali as its highlands, once the agricultural center of the island, have, in many areas, been transformed by craft production into servicing tourists.  The effect that this change in the labor landscape has on Balinese knowledge of the environment is a component of this study.

495,"With this CAREER Award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is supporting the research of Professor Zachary Ball of Rice University. Professor Ball is developing a new concept for the proximity-based chemical modification of proteins through a new combination of supramolecular chemistry and organometallic catalysis.   This approach results in catalytic activity based on shape and secondary structure rather than inherent functional group reactivity. Professor Ball's method will be used to characterize polypeptide binding interfaces, based on the ability of dirhodium metallopeptides to convert transient binding into covalent modification. Fleeting interactions between proteins govern numerous biological signaling processes, yet are challenging to study. The new approach may provide a conceptually novel alternative to traditional affinity-labeling and photo-affinity labeling, and potentially one that will be able to capture weaker and/or more transient protein-protein interactions.This Rh-carbenoid labeling technique could have important applications in chemical biology, in the longer term, both to identify as yet unknown binding partners for a given probe ligand, and to potentially even begin to identify new cellular signaling or regulatory pathways.  The project will serve as a platform to train future scientists, both through graduate student training and through affiliated teacher-training programs in local districts with significant populations of economically disadvantaged students and of minorities traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Professor Ball will conduct a comprehensive teacher-training program consisting of instruction in chemistry and chemical education, research experience, and new curriculum development. Teachers will spend a summer in the PI's lab to conduct research and to develop inquiry-based lessons based on their research. Lesson plans will be disseminated through talks at regional ACS meetings, workshops for other high school teachers in Houston, and via the web. affinity labeling; Affinity Labels; Award; base; Biological; Biology; Catalysis; catalyst; Chemicals; Chemistry; computerized data processing; Development; Economically Deprived Population; Education; Educational Curriculum; Educational workshop; experience; functional group; Future; graduate student; high school; Instruction; Internet; Label; Life; Ligands; meetings; Methods; Minority; Modification; novel; novel strategies; Organometallic Chemistry; polypeptide; Population; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Process; professor; programs; protein protein interaction; Proteins; Regulatory Pathway; Research; Research Support; Rice; School Teachers; Science; Scientist; Shapes; Signal Transduction; Structure; Students; teacher; Techniques; Training; Training Programs; UniversitiesCAREER: STRUCTURE-SELECTIVE PROTEIN MODIFICATION WITH DIRHODIUM METALLOPEPTIDE CATALYSTS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06

497,"This grant supports the Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS). TAGS is a weekend regional meeting held each spring since 2005, hosted in turn by Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University.  The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states.  Although many participating institutions have Algebraic Geometry seminars that run through the academic year, the audience at each location is small. TAGS provides regional concentration benefits: we have many speakers in a short time who can reach many listeners in one place. We aim to bring a diverse collection of excellent speakers who are doing cutting-edge research across the many subfields of Algebraic Geometry. Background talks are given for the benefit of students and young researchers; there is a poster session for graduate students to afford them both feedback from and exposure to experts.Algebraic geometry is a broad field of mathematics concerned with the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  It has amply documented connections to many areas of mathematics (number theory symplectic geometry, representation theory, mathematical physics, etc.), and its applications reverberate in a variety of contexts (robotics, coding theory, complexity theory, etc.).  Conferences like TAGS help algebraic geometers stay abreast of current developments in this rapidly-evolving area of mathematics.

500,"The annual global production of rice husks (RHs) is ca. 160 million tons. The current application of RHs has been very limited, mainly owing to their tough, woody, abrasive nature, low nutritive properties, great bulk, and high ash content. RHs are often burnt in open field in developing countries, generating serious pollution issues, and are disposed at additional cost in developed countries. Therefore, RHs are widely considered as a bio-waste.RHs are mainly composed of lignocellulose (ca. 85 wt%) and hydrated silica (ca. 15 wt%). We aimed to develop an effective approach to first separate lignocellulose from RHs by dissolving it in ionic liquids (ILs). The dissolved lignocellulose was subsequently separated and can be used as a starting material for fabric products, biofuel, etc. The remaining RH residues after extraction that contain a high concentration of hydrated silica were thermally treated to synthesize nanostructured silica materials, such as nanoparticles, porous frameworks. This project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between students from science major and engineering major. Science students focus on fundamental aspects, while engineering students focus on process design and scale-up. In summary, the objective of this project is to produce two value-added products: lignocellulose and nanostructured silica, from RH biomass, which in turn helps significantly minimize pollutions and cost associated with the current disposal of RHs.

501,"Butte‐Glenn Community College District (ButteCollege) is a public, two‐year institution of higher education that enrolls 14,000 students. Ourcampus is rurally isolated, and we are situated half way between San Francisco and the Oregonborder, in the fertile upper reaches of the Sacramento Valley. We are considered a leader infostering understanding of sustainability in all our curriculum and college activities (Blanchet2008). Our community college district serves two counties: Butte, equivalent in geographic sizeto the state of Delaware; and Glenn, equal in size to Rhode Island. Our economy is agriculturebased, and we are experiencing an explosive growth of first generation Hispanic students, andother low income minorities including African‐American, Sikh, and Hmong. Our enrollmentscontinue to surge because of chromic high unemployment in California, 9.3 %, and 12.9 % inButte County and even higher, 16.9% in Glenn County. Loss of agricultural jobs due tomechanization is creating structural unemployment in our region. Many of our students want toreverse the situation facing their parents and grandparents, by achieving higher aspirations inScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Our successful MathEngineering Science Achievement (MESA) program has achieved this goal for many of our firstgeneration, low‐income students. We have been able to build upon the success of the MESAProgram’s Student Research Projects through the Environmental Protection Agency’s People,Prosperity and the Planet (EPA P3) Program. Our intent is to leverage our MESA studentresearch projects to achieve a clear transfer path to four‐year colleges and universities for them.With this in mind, we are pleased to submit to EPA our student‐led project, “Rice Hulls asAlternative Building” (RHAB), for Productive Use of Agricultural Waste Report and Phase IIproposal. Of the 45 2011-12 awards made in the EPA P3 Phase l grants to colleges anduniversities, Butte College was the only community college awarded.Accomplishing the goals of the Rice Hulls as Alternative Building” (RHAB) projectwould impact the communities affected by the rice growing areas locally and globally. Theobjective of this project is to provide an appropriate, environmentally acceptable disposal of agricultural waste, in this case, rice hulls which are left behind in huge quantities after harvestingand processing rice produced in Northern California and other rice producing areas in the UnitedStates and around the World. This is to be done by the development of structural insulatingpanels (SIPs) for use in residential and commercial building construction utilizing rice hulls astheir primary raw material. Normally, structural insulating panels are made of a layer ofStyrofoam panel sandwiched between two sheets of plywood. We plan to modify this concept tomake use of rice hulls.Potential economic benefits resulting from this project could be very large if thedevelopment effort is successful. The supply of rice hulls, the principal raw material of theproposed RHAB building system, is plentiful in Northern California. The local industry resultingfrom the manufacturing of the RHAB building system could be a multi-million dollar annualbusiness with a marketing area over the entire western part of the United States. AdditionalRHAB manufacturing facilities could be established in other rice growing regions, such as themid-west and southern United States, indeed around the World, because rice is one of the mostwidely grown agricultural products worldwide.A potential significant positive environmental and heath impact offered by the project isthe reduction of air pollution and emission of greenhouse gases that could be achieved by theworldwide application of the proposed RHAB b Achievement; Affect; African American; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Area; Award; California; college; Communities; community college; County; Delaware; Development; Economics; Educational Curriculum; Engineering; Enrollment; experience; Generations; Geography; Goals; grandparent; Grant; greenhouse gases; Growth; higher education; Hispanics; Industry; Institution; Left; Low income; manufacturing facility; Marketing; Mathematics; Mind; Minority; Names; Occupations; Parents; Phase; Planets; programs; Reporting; Research Project Grants; Rhode Island; Rice; Rural; San Francisco; Science; Students; success; System; Technology; Unemployment; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Universities; wastingRICE HULLS AS ALTERNATIVE BUILDING (RHAB) PROJECT",0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999

504,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Introduction: Despite an information explosion about antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in bacteria, patients are dying of untreatable infections for the first time since antibiotics were discovered. The main cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in gram-negative bacteria is active efflux of drug by bacterial pumps. Knowing how the pumps are regulated is the key to understanding MDR development: bacteria can become MDR simply by increasing expression of these efflux pumps. Significance: Bacteroides fragilis are ubiquitous gut commensals that cause devastating disease when they escape the gut; their resistance to antimicrobials is rising significantly. In aerobes, MDR is caused by efflux pumps regulated by transcription factors (TFs). We hypothesize that MDR efflux pumps in B. fragilis are similarly regulated by TFs. These TFs, and the pumps they regulate, may also regulate other virulence factors. VA patients are particularly at risk for anaerobic infections. Mortality in Bacteroides bacteremia is high (25- 50%) and liver disease, common in VA patients, is a risk factor for increased mortality. We identified several MDR clinical isolates (including one from a GI in Afghanistan) with increased pump activity; these isolates were resistant to metronidazole and other agents and resulted in one death and one amputation, respectively. Preliminary Studies: In the previous funding period, we identified and characterized the B. fragilis bme efflux pump genes and showed that they were implicated in clinical MDR (described in 23 publications); we found that increases in pump levels and in resistance could be induced by a variety of agents and stressors including antimicrobials, salicylate, bile and quorum sensing molecules. We constructed new vectors and modified them to mimic the molecular tools available for use with aerobes. Research Plan: Our long term goal is to unravel the complex regulation of MDR in B. fragilis. Specifically, our goals now are to: AIM 1: Identify the TFs most important in efflux-mediated MDR (both activator and repressor TFs) using a functional genomic approach. AIM 2: Characterize TFs most important in efflux-mediated MDR. Determine the phenotype associated with the TF, measure MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) and determine the relevant bme genes. Demonstrate binding by physical and functional approaches. AIM 3: Determine the clinical prevalence of TF regulation in efflux mediated MDR. Measure TF transcription levels in clinical isolates, including the recently acquired MDR strains. Determine the effect of TF on efflux-mediated MDR and on ability to form biofilms. Assess the effect of bile exposure on TF transcription levels, MICs and biofilm forming ability. This study takes advantage of our unique resources: expertise with molecular and biochemical approaches, access to a massive collection of clinical isolates and associated MIC data, and excellent collaborative relationships with world-class experts. Once completed, this work, together with the studies already conducted, will reveal important new information about regulation of BF MDR pumps and will greatly contribute to our knowledge of regulation mechanisms in this bacterium that is subject to very different stresses than aerobic pathogens. B. fragilis is an important component of the gut microbiome (which has been called a separate  organ  within the human body) that is recognized as having its own impressive metabolic profile and profoundly affects almost every aspect of human health and disease. In this global environment, there is little time from the emergence of the first MDR strains to widespread resistance. Racing to develop effective drugs when untreatable infections emerge is not a viable public health strategy. Regulators of MDR efflux are important targets in drug discovery; identifying and understanding the TFs that are most important in these MDR organisms will lead to the development of new and effective interventional therapies that target the expression or translation of these factors.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Rising antimicrobial resistance costs 5-30 billion dollars and 90,000 lives in the US alone! Multi-drug efflux pumps are largely responsible for this resistance.

505,"Flooding and drought are increasingly experienced in agricultural systems as a consequence of global climate change, which can cause serious reductions in food, fiber and forest production worldwide. Rice is a semi-aquatic plant that is mostly grown in flooded paddy fields. However, complete submergence due to flash flooding results in considerable yield loss ($1 billion / year) in Asia. Flooding in the US in 2011 affected rice production. Drought is also a major natural disaster, which decreases rice productivity. Submergence and drought are extremes in precipitation, but the two environmental stresses can occur sequentially during a single crop cycle significantly deceasing rice yield. Our international collaboration team identified a single gene, called SUBMERGENCE-1A (SUB1A), which is sufficient to confer submergence tolerance to intolerant rice. Rice cultivars containing SUB1A are produced by breeding and called Sub1 rice. These can endure complete submergence for 14-16 days and reinitiate growth and development after floodwater resides. We found that the submergence tolerance regulator also enhances drought tolerance. The major goal of this USDA-AFRI funded project is to obtain a clear understanding of mechanisms of submergence and drought tolerance regulated by SUB1A. Our AFRI studies revealed that SUB1A functions to restrict carbohydrate consumption and elongation growth, reducing carbohydrate starvation during submergence. We also found that Sub1 rice form new leaves and tillers even when severely damaged by submergence and drought. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that: 1) SUB1A may safeguard the specific regions of rice shoots which are necessary for production of new leaves after the stress. 2) SUB1A may regulate carbohydrate production, consumption, and translocation differentially in the organs which store or consume carbohydrate reserves. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a series of comparative analyses using lines that differ in their DNA only in the presence or absence SUB1A. We will evaluate the functional importance of SUB1A in the regulation of gene expression and metabolism at specific organs. We will also determine the impact of SUB1A on cell division at the leaf-forming regions during and after stress conditions. This project should provide new insight into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the complex organ-specific responses to submergence and drought, which is of benefit to create new rice cultivars with enhanced stress tolerance.

506,"Pathogens and pests can be the most important constraints on crop yields. They can also poison food supplies by contributing to mycotoxin contamination. Genetic resistance is the preferred solution because of its low cost and ease of deployment but often resistance is futile. The short generation time and large populations of pathogens and pests enable them to evolve new races that overcome resistance. They similarly overcome pesticides. Many biotic threats to US crops are controlled solely by quarantine. Clearly there is a need to understand crop immune systems sufficiently so that stable, artificial immunity can be generated and deployed. In plants the natural sensors that detect infection produce weak signals but these are amplified to an effective level by a poorly understood mechanism. Our project is focused on understanding how the signals are amplified. The amplification mechanism is based on the creation and detection of specific plant peptides. We will study both creation and detection and we will validate our findings by attempting to generate stable, artificial immunity in maize to fungal infection. Validated findings should be broadly applicable to the other grass crops including wheat, rice, sugarcane, barley, oats, switchgrass, and Miscanthus.

507,"Rice is an excellent species for understanding both host/microbe interactions and small RNAs. To date, connections between plant small RNAs and plant defenses have been described almost exclusively in the model dicot, Arabidopsis; this proposal examines the underlying basis of a novel relationship between small RNAs and defenses that we have identified in rice. The role of the HEN1 protein is to methylate small RNAs. This modification is essential for the biological function of small RNAs, as a loss of HEN1 function leads to rapid degradation of small RNAs. Reduction of HEN1 levels in Arabidopsis or rice mutants results in defective developmental phenotypes. Several lines of evidence connect the rice OsHEN1 to plant defense responses. We have established that Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice, modulates the expression of the host OsHEN1 via a transcription activator-like (TAL) type III  effector protein  called PthXo8. PthXo8 is a virulence factor in Xoo since pthXo8 knockout causes strains to be less virulent. On the other hand, OsHEN1 is a host disease susceptibility gene as rice plants with nonfunctional OsHEN1 become more resistant (or less susceptible) to Xoo than the wild type control. Furthermore, in an Oshen1 loss-of-function mutant, levels of microRNA miR398 and miR408 are substantially impacted, and the target genes of these miRNAs involved in modulating cellular copper (Cu) levels. Recent work by other labs has shown that Xoo infection (strain PXO99) changes Cu distribution in rice leaf tissues and that removing Cu from xylem is associated with development of disease. This project will address the role of OsHEN1 in the modulation of cellular Cu levels and rice defense responses. The hypothesis underlying this work is that modulation of small RNA levels by OsHEN1 plays an important role in the response of rice to Xoo by altering small RNA levels, and this is potentially related to altered cellular copper levels, although other cellular functions regulated by miRNAs or even regulation of siRNAs may be involved, so we will investigate other miRNAs that are impacted by altered OsHEN1 levels. In addition, developing a better understanding of OsHEN1 function will provide fundamental insights into small RNA biology of rice and will serve as a model for other grasses.

508,"Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. Like many other pathogens, the rice blast fungus develop a specialized infection structure known as appressorium to penetrate plant. The fungal pathogen can recognize various plant surface signals for regulating appressorium formation. However, molecular mechanisms of surface sensing and importance of different signals are not well understood. Recently, the Msb2 signaling mucin and Sho1 sensor genes were found to be important for appressorium formation in the rice blast fungus. The goal of this study is to characterize surface sensing mechanisms involved in the activation of the signal transduction pathway that regulates appressorium formation and invasive growth in this pathogen. Objective 1 is to further characterize the activation and mode of action of the MSB2 sensor. Some of genes that interact with Msb2 may play roles in transducing signals to the activate appressorium formation. Objective 2 is to determine the functional relationship between MSB2 and CBP1 in surface sensing. CBP1 is structurally similar to MSB2 and it also plays a role in appressorium formation. These two sensors may have overlapping functions in recognizing different plant surface signals. Objective 3 aims to determine the interaction of PTH11 with other receptors and appressorium inducing activites of different epicuticular wax components. PTH11 is the only receptor gene that is known in the rice blast fungus to be involved in recognizing surface hydrophobicity. Results from this study will provide better understanding of surface recognition mechanisms. Many plant pathogenic fungi may use similar molecular mechanisms to respond to plant surface signals. Disruption the recognition of surface signals will provide a novel approach to control fungal diseases.

509,"With past research funding, we obtained compelling evidence suggesting that the globally devastating blast fungus manipulates rice plasmodesmata (PD) for disease development. Plasmodesmata are tiny cytoplasmic communication channels connecting cells across the thick plant cell wall. First, the fungus appears to use PD for cell-to-cell spread of its specialized disease factors (effectors), which function to hijack host cells before invasion. Second, the fungus appears to co-opt PD for moving into new host cells without causing damage. This indicates remarkable manipulation of PD since hyphae are >100-times larger than the empty cell wall tunnels housing PD components. To understand fungus-PD interactions, we will label fungal effectors and rice PD components with complementary fluorescent reporters and use fluorescence and electron microscopy to produce a detailed view of structures and events involved. We will determine how fungal infection impacts PD structure, and if it controls the sizes of molecules that pass through PD. We will determine if the fungus impacts PD-associated callose, the carbohydrate involved in determining the opening size or totally closing off PD and isolating plant cells. We will understand if the fungus co-opts a natural plant mechanism for enlarging PD tunnels in order to pass through. This research opens a significant new front in plant-fungal pathogen research, with the potential to provide many novel targets for disease control.

510,"Cogongrass has invaded 1.5 million acres in the southern US. Current control measures of herbicide application and tillage are too costly for the largely economically-depressed, rural southern US. Moreover, these control measures do not adequately control Cogongrass, which demonstrates extraordinary adaptability to a range of soil types, rainfall regimes, and temperature conditions. Furthermore, Cogongrass has been identified as an alternate host for Rice Yellow Mottle Virus and for Imperata Yellow Mottle Virus, a maize pathogen and thus constitutes a significant threat to domestic and global food security. Cogongrass is a compelling example of a species for which biological controls should be developed. This project will produce a population-genetic profile with sufficient resolution to correlate US Cogongrass genotypes to genotypes from the native range(s) in order to identify and genetically characterize potential host-specific biological controls for this noxious weed. The project will involve large-scale sampling of US and international Cogongrass populations, use of next generation high-throughput genotyping by sequencing and extensive surveys for natural enemies in its native range(s) with the intent of identifying and evaluating potential host-specific biological controls for US deployment.

511,"Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are used in cosmetics, hygiene products, biomedical applications, electronics, optics, food packaging textile, water treatment, fuel cells, sensors, and environmental remediation. They have unique physicochemical properties that are not found in bulk materials with the same chemical composition. Because of their unique properties and interactions with the environment, some ENPs are reported to be harmful to human and other ecosystem components. With rapidly growing demand and production, ENPs are finding their way into the environment via air, water, and soil routes. Plants, being the primary components of the food chain, are the most important gateways through which nanoparticles may enter the food chain, contribute to their bioaccumulation, and find their way to human receptors. This is an emerging threat to human food safety and health. This research will study the life-cycles of two ENPs (zinc oxide and carbon nanotube) in plants from germination to maturity. Uptake and transport of ENPs, their effects on plant growth, and impacts at the genetic and genomic levels will be studied in a fresh crop (spinach) and a major food crop (rice). The research findings are expected to throw lights on accumulation of ENPs and their genetic manifestations in human foods. The computer-based models developed by this research will pave the way to simulate other nanoparticles for different food crops.

512,"The Same Canoe Community Garden's Project is fostering a network of 12 organizations, 24 non-profit community People's Garden projects, and 120 neighborhood mini-garden demonstration projects. The goal of these projects it to empower West Hawaii's low income, high poverty, food desert, and at-risk populations to gain access to healthier foods they grow themselves. In addition to food gardens, this community collaborative will also work on wildlife habitat gardens and reforestation projects. A total of 144 community and neighborhood People's Garden plots will be the outcome of this project and will generate over 1,500 pounds of fresh nutritious foods as an active step towards addressing food desert and food insecure area needs by reclaiming our local food system. $82,000 of the $110,500 grant request will go directly to People's Garden materials, equipment, and technical support. Total audience will be 1,720; total direct end users 254, with 48 directly involved in developing community capacity building leadership skills. The Same Canoe Community Gardens Project seeks to reclaim a nearly-lost heritage of sustainable local food systems by learning from Hawaii's pre-contact agriculture practices and by adopting new enhanced production methods for food gardens, wildlife habitat gardens, and for local native reforestation projects. The discovery and settling of the Hawaiian Islands was originally accomplished by building on a foundation of Polynesian canoe gardens. These first Hawaiian gardens were models of food security and sustainability and were essential to survival over many hundreds of years. Today, in a time where 90% of foods consumed in Hawaii are imported from ports over 2,500 miles away, a meal's ingredients will have traveled an average of 4,000 miles from farm to plate. This dependence on processed, less-than-fresh foods, with a high carbon footprint, is causing significant health problems for all Hawaii residents. The rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in Hawaii show that: 80.6% are overweight or obese, 61.5% have diabetes and high cholesterol, 68.35% have hypertension, and Native Hawaiians are 5.7% are more likely to die of diabetes that whites living in Hawaii (per statistics from the CDC). The irony of living in a potential year round fruit basket but having ubiquitous imported white rice and imported high fat meats as primary staples is alarming - and is inspiring a growing local foods interest. The Same Canoe Community Gardens Project is addressing this interest in local food production and will provide the knowledge, tools, and materials to assist over 1700 people to understand the methods that can lead to improved food self-sufficien.

513,"Ojibwe view Nibi (water) as sacred and central to all aspects of Ojibwe culture from the creation story to the prophecies that instructed the people to migrate westward to where they would find Manoomin (wild rice)  food that grows on the water.  Wild rice and fish are fundamental and essential to the traditional Ojibwe diet and depend on clean, healthy, diverse aquatic ecosystems. All of those resources are threatened by untreated wastewater from non-compliant and failing septic systems. Federal regulations do not address septic system maintenance, which means individual Bands are responsible for septic system maintenance and homeowner education. To date, 630 SSTS inspections have been completed and 60% of the inspected systems have been found to be non-compliant or failing. Both non-compliant and failing systems contribute to ground and surface water pollution. If we assume 60% noncompliance and failure rate for all 2,000 SSTS on the Reservation, approximately 1,200 septic systems are currently polluting the water resources of the Leech Lake Reservation. EPA's established guidelines for wastewater estimate 75 gallons of water usage per person daily, and assuming a three-bedroom home with two occupants per bedroom, 1,200 failing SSTS result in approximately 1.9 million gallons of untreated wastewater per year being released into the environment on the Leech Lake Reservation (Mayer et al., 1999). Tribal populations are especially susceptible to adverse health effects from exposure to pollution. Tribal communities practicing traditional, cultural and spiritual lifeways have greater environmental contact rates compared to members of suburban communities. For example, the established fish consumption rate for a Leech Lake Band member is 224 grams per day, while the established suburban consumption rate is 17.5 grams per day (Leech Lake Reservation Tribal Council [LL RTC] 2001). In addition to food intake, many tribal practices contribute to increased frequency, intensity and duration of environmental exposure such as gathering and preparing plants, clays, and minerals for food, medicinal purposes and other traditional practices. SSTS on the Reservation are failing, in part, because of the Band's housing situation. In Minnesota, septic systems are designed based on the number of water-using appliances and the number of bedrooms. Occupancy of two people per bedroom with each person using 75 gallons of water per day is assumed. The reality is that most homes on the Reservation have a greater number of occupants per residence than non-Native homes. Also systems are not properly operated and maintained with periodic pumping. The average life of a septic system is 20 years; however, that time span can be expanded to 30 years and beyond with proper operation and maintenance (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA],1999). Septic systems on the Reservation are not being properly maintained in large part because homeowners have not been educated on the proper operation and maintenance of their systems. Many residents of the Reservation are unaware of the importance of proper wastewater management to protect their drinking water and food sources.

514,"The U.S. is a major exporter of rice, and both domestic consumption and export has been increasing in recent years. Due to the impending phase-out of the fumigant methyl bromide,revised integrated insect pest management plans specific for rice mills are critical to maintaining product quality and economic viability. Red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is the primary pest in rice mills, and is the most frequently targeted pest for methyl bromide fumigations under the continuing use exemption program for rice mills. We are proposing to develop integrated pest management programs to reduce reliance on methyl bromide fumigation for red flour beetle control in rice mills in the U.S. The results should also be applicable to other insect pests in the rice milling system as well. Spatial distribution and movement patterns of red flour beetle populations will be assessed to determine the impact of rough rice storage as a source of infestation in mills, and thus limits the infestation sources to reduce the need for whole-plant control measures such as fumigation. As rice is milled, various components are produced, and we will develop predictive models for population development on various milling components, i.e. milled rice, husks and bran. At the same time, we will evaluate the effects of accumulations of these milled fractions on surfaces treated with residual insecticides, how these accumulations impact residual efficacy of the compound, and determine impacts of sanitation and cleaning on red flour beetle population development, in addition to conducting field assessments. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis will integrate sampling and control. Technology transfer and information delivery will be accomplished through posting documents on eXtension and other websites and conducting workshops with stakeholders. Implementation of this program will allow rice mills to reduce the need for and frequency of structural fumigations and better meet EPA required terminations for methyl bromide.

515,"Rice is fundamentally and uniquely important as the staple food that feeds half the world's population. Meeting the challenge of feeding increased population from finite resources will require improved yields in rice, particularly under limiting conditions. Not only is rice (Oryza sativa) an important crop plant, but it is a model species for cereals and cereal genomics. Rice has a smaller genome than other monocot crop plants, a deep collection of germplasm accessions of domestic and wild rice is available, and it is the most readily transformable cereal crop. Molecular and genetic resources for rice have grown in recent years. The combined set of resources make the advances in genetics and genomics in rice arguably the most advanced in any cereal crop. The aim of this project is to support the participation of US students, post-docs and scientists in an annual international conference on rice functional genomics. The rice community meets annually to advance cereal genomics and biology by sharing current, cutting-edge research, as well as through strategic planning and discussions of future international collaborative efforts. The participation of young and diverse US scientists ensures the future of our field.

As a foundation for this model, IC has reviewed and analyzed the cultural backgrounds of other Native American tribes and bands. This research shows that his history of the Native American people provides evidence of a culture strong enough to withstand the most difficult hardships. Though their lives were changed in many ways over the centuries, their cooking and eating traditions have become mainstays of contemporary American cuisine. Many Native American recipes have been adopted by white populations in different regions in the United States, including succotash in the South, wild rice dishes in the northern Plains, pumpkin soup in New England, chili in the Southwest, broiled salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and corn on the cob in most areas of the country. Indeed, Native Americans have influenced American cuisine in many ways. For complex reasons, Alaska Natives have not had the opportunity to access health care in ways that other Americans have, this has caused serious health problems. The limitations imposed on their living conditions, in concert with the socioeconomic obstacles that Native Americans face in general, challenges their livelihood. Though some programs have begun to target Native Americans' health problems, their future depends on receiving proper care for modern-day diseases.

517,"Apple snail, (Pomacea canaliculata), a highly invasive pest affecting wetland crops in 18 countries including the U.S., is listed as one of the 100 Worst Global Invaders. One study showed that due to its voracious appetite, present value damage from the snail could cost Philippine rice production as much as 2.3 billion dollars annually. In Hawai`i, the apple snail invasion has reduced taro harvests for the small and mid-sized farms that comprise the local taro industry by 18% to 25% annually. This project will research a unique control for apple snail on Hawai`i's wetland taro production using the unrefined glycerin co-product (UCP) from biodiesel production as a soil conditioner. The research will identify a uniform product, test the product on non-target species and conduct field trials on wetland taro to determine efficacy in controlling apple snail and impacts on soil and plant health. The end goal will be to develop a marketable product that provides environmentally safe control of apple snail on taro and enhances the efficiency and profitability of small taro farms. Locally manufacturing an agricultural amendment, Aina Mo, for use in Hawaiian taro production saves energy through import substitution. Developing value-added co-products from biodiesel refining will improve profitability for the renewable fuels industry. Sustaining and increasing wetland taro production will revitalize rural areas and preserve wetland habitat. Developing a natural organic compound that effectively controls this invasive pest will preserve water quality in streams and coastal waters and has potential applications for wetland rice production and preservation of wetlands globally.

518,"The long term goal of this project is to eliminate insect pests from the US food and feed supply with a sensor device, minimize exposure of humans and animals to residual chemicals or insecticides, and reduce financial losses due to grain damage. The lesser grain borer (LGB) is a devastating, long-lived pest of stored wheat, corn and other cereal grains in the US and other parts of the world. Adults and larvae are voracious feeders causing damaged kernels, insect fragments in milled products, powdery residues (frass), a characteristic pungent odor, price discounts, and possible rejection of commodity. The LGB can penetrate many types of packaging material including seed sacks in addition to sound grain. Grain production, storage, and processing are important industries. More than 12 billion bushels of corn and wheat are grown in the US each year with a value exceeding $25 billion. Additionally, over a billion bushels of barley, oats, rice, rye, and sorghum are grown each year with a value over $3 billion. It has been estimated that 5-10% of stored grain in developed countries and 35% of stored grain in developing countries is lost to insect damage. Because of the extensive reach of this insect, there is also very broad societal benefit in achieving widespread use of effective sensors for detecting the insects early. Estimates of the cost of grain loss due to insect, mold, and mycotoxin damage to the 15 billion bushels of grain stored in the US each year have ranged from $500 million to more than $1 billion. Domestic flour millers have a low tolerance for live insects: their presence signs of insect feeding can result in grain rejection. Rejection produces additional fumigation and transportation expenses, as much as 10-20% of the grain value. The foundation of a successful integrated pest management (IPM) program is an effective monitoring system. SDC declares that it can provide that foundation with its sensor device. SDC has two objectives in this proposal: 1) Modify the preliminary prototype device for LGB detection, using basic and applied knowledge, and compare its performance and efficacy with current methods in a field test and 2) Demonstrate uniqueness and the concentration levels of marker pheromones associated with infestations of the LGB. SDC's hypothesis is that specific organic volatiles can be good markers to differentiate insects infesting stored crops from other harmless emanations, e.g. gases associated with normal crop odor, or other MVOCs. Marker biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from this insect, the aggregation pheromones dominicalene 1 and dominicalene 2, are found in sufficient concentrations in the headspace in enclosures containing these insects to permit detection with SDC's highly sensitive and selective sensor device. SDC is confident that this work will result in a complete sensor device that can be used effectively to detect BVOCs from lesser grain borers, relate those BVOCs to LGB infestation size, and provide the information needed by farmers and elevator operators to take action to prevent infestation growth in our food and feed supply.

519,"Weed management is generally viewed as a major challenge in conventional, transitional and organic cropping systems. Natural product herbicides have the potential to play an important role on organic farms by reducing reliance on tillage and cultivation and by replacing expensive hand weeding operations. On the other hand, cost effective natural products with high efficacy could replace more toxic pesticides currently in use on conventional farms. One of the current problems in today's agriculture is the development of herbicide resistance among weeds, particularly among biotypes of rice weeds such as early and late watergrass. Natural product herbicides with novel chemistries can potentially offer a solution for resistance management, particularly if their efficacy is based on new modes of action. The research proposed here is focusing on the development of efficacious natural product herbicides based on microbial metabolites and other natural products. More specifically, we are proposing the development of a microbial bioherbicide which combines a strain of actinomycetes (Streptomyces sp.) isolated from marine sources with another synergistic natural product compound. The secondary metabolite from the herbicidal Streptomyces strain, thaxtomin A, has in preliminary tests shown good herbicidal activity as well as selectivity for rice. The research proposed here will evaluate the herbicidal efficacy and phytotoxicity of microbial thaxtomin A when used in combination with other active compounds produced by microbes or derived from plant extracts against the most common rice weeds in the US. Part of this project will focus on determination of mechanism of action for novel herbicidal compounds obtained in the applicant's in-house screening program. Preliminary bioassays on some of the novel herbicidal compounds have shown good efficacy against grass weeds, which suggests that they could be used in combination with thaxtomin A to enhance its efficacy against grass weeds in rice cultivations. The results from the Phase I research will help assess the commercial potential of these new bioherbicides, especially the one selective for rice. The results indicating low toxicity, economical production, and good efficacy support the registration of these novel products as biopesticides for use in both conventional and organic farming. We expect that these new biocontrol products would first be used for organic production but due to increased demand for new herbicidal products for resistance management, they will also benefit conventional farms looking for new pesticides with low toxicity and new modes of action.

[NP 301, C4, PS 4A]3: To determine the function of genes through transgenic tests. [NP 301, C4, PS 4A]Approach:Maize is an important crop as well as a model organism for other cereals such assorghum, barley, rice and wheat. The large number of genetic mutants, incombination with the ease of obtaining and mapping additional mutants, makes maize an excellent system for determining the function of genes. We propose to identify genes that regulate maize leaf development and shoot architecture. We will carry out mutagenesis with defined inbreds using the chemical mutagen EMS. Mutants will be characterized genetically and histologically. The genes will be mapped to position and cloned. The functions will be determined by expression analysis and further genetics. We already have two mutants at different stages of analysis. The dominant Liguleless narrow mutant has been mapped to position and beginning characterization is under way. The dominant Wavy auricle in blade1 (Wab1) mutant has been localized to a BAC contig. Once we clone Wab1, we will determine the function of the wild-type gene product. In order to follow expression of the genes we clone, we have developed a vector for gene fusions. We are presently testing this vector with the liguleless1 gene. REPLACING 5335-21000-028-00D (09/10).

523,"Agricultural output can be reduced by abiotic stressors including lack of rainfall, shortage of irrigation water, unseasonably cold temperatures and saline soil, or biotic stressors including insects and microbial pathogens. The quality of seed, fruit, and other primary products can deteriorate during post-harvest handling, including cold storage. Tolerance of abiotic and biotic stresses from seedling emergence through delivery of the final product can avoid losses of billions of dollar annually in the US. Crop plant germplasm generally contains genetic diversity that remains a rich resource for further gains in plant performance in relation to this suite of environmental stresses. Genetic determinants of tolerance and resistance traits can be located genetically and followed in plant breeding schemes using nearby molecular markers. Each marked trait determinant also provides an opportunity to develop a mechanistic understanding of the underlying genes and proteins by applying molecular cloning methods to identify the gene. Global studies of gene expression patterns and cellular-level studies further refine a mechanistic understanding of how the trait operates, and ultimately lead to perfect genetic markers of the trait. This project provides molecular markers for a range of environmental stress tolerance and resistance traits in crop plants including mainly cowpea, barley and citrus, and to a lesser extent wheat, rice, cassava and banana/plantain. This project integrates molecular markers into plant breeding programs in California, nationally throughout the US, and worldwide. This project also encompasses detailed mechanistic studies of specific stress-related genes and proteins. Mechanistic studies of some of the most promising proteins are being conducted through biochemical and physicochemical analyses. A family of drought-related proteins called dehydrins remains a prominent component of this project.

524,GTPases are involved in critical signaling events within the cell. This includes immune responses to pathogens such as the blast fungus which attacks rice and other crops. This research focuses on determining the unique features in GTPases of interest that differentiate the particular protein from its many evolutionarily related family members. For this we use methods in structural biology such as X-ray crystallography and computational analysis. The long-term anticipated benefit is to be able to design or discover ligands with function towards specific crop and animal diseases without affecting critical functions of closely related and therefore structurally similar proteins.

525,"The Arkansas rice breeding program is a key component for maintaining a viable rice industry. Long-grain rice yields have increased in the last decade with the addition of Katy, Alan, Millie, Adair, LaGrue, Kaybonnet, Drew and Wells rice cultivars. Jupiter, Cheniere, Catahoula, and Cocodrie semi-dwarf cultivars occupy a significant portion of Arkansas rice area and production. Locally developed semi-dwarfs offer advantages including better stress tolerance and more stable yields. Further improvement through the transfer of desirable characters into new semi-dwarf rice cultivars will be continued. Both conventional and molecular techniques are utilized in our project to efficiently generate and evaluate new germplasm and breeding lines. The incorporation of novel rice germplasm into Arkansas cultivars requires careful characterization of the new introductions. Plant pathology, entomology, cereal chemistry and plant nutrition are taken into account prior to programming crosses. Genetic analysis using molecular marker technology will improve efficiency of gene incorporation. Field evaluation of advanced experimental lines is required prior to release of new cultivars, coupled with recommended management practices. At least 7 to 10 years are required to develop and release a new cultivar.

526,"Food quality and safety issues relating the oil and fat composition of major Arkansas agricultural commodities will be addressed, as oils and fats play an important part in food nutritional value, rancidity flavor quality and general health. Studies will focus on health promoting properties of beneficial oil/fat components and their incorporation into food systems. Obtaining an understanding of oil/fat chemistry that affects food acceptability and human health will be of particular interest. Since many oils/fat can produce rancid off flavors, an improved understanding and control of the potential for rancidity deterioration in oil/fats will be gained and novel methods will be developed as necessary. These new methods may be conventional chemical analysis or spectroscopy to obtain new insights into chemical changes of commercial and nutritional importance. Techniques will be developed to enhance the nutritional value of food lipids by increasing the content of desirable health promoting substances and introducing novel desirable substances into lipid foods. The impact of such dietary lipids on key nutritional indicators of health, such as low density lipoprotein, will be explored from nutritional and epidemiological perspectives in cooperation with nutritional scientists. The development of food co-products for food and non-food value added products will continue in response to company needs, to further develop markets. A major focus will be incorporating rice hull silica extraction within a broader framework of extracting other commercially useful components within the frame work of a sustainable biorefinery system, to exploit all the hull components to their full potential. This nwill be done in cooperation with other scientists.

527,"Research on unique functional properties, and industrial uses of plant proteins has been emphasized as an expanding area of national need. Rice bran and soy bean meal are co-products of the rice and soybean oil processing industry, and if novel uses for the proteins in rice, rice bran, soybean meal and alternate crops could be found, it would add value to both these industries. This project investigates modified proteins, and co-products, as value-added ingredients for functional and health benefits. Investigating the functional properties of these native and modified proteins differing in albumin, glutelin, globulin and prolamin content will give valuable information that could lead to design of suitable protein mixtures to obtain novel protein ingredients with unique functional properties and possibly enhanced nutritional value. Moreover, hydrolyzed proteins and their resulting peptides can also bear functionalities that can be used in a variety of food product applications. Since proteins are highly complexed with other constituents, improved and optimized methods need to be employed to obtain optimum quantities of the proteins or peptides. For the purpose of human consumption the proteins/peptides need to be resistant to the degradative environemnt of the gut and hence, processes need to be developed to obtain proteins/peptides resistant to the gut. Without proper separation and fractionation techniques it will be difficult to characterize the proteins/peptides that show enhanced functions.

528,"Just as organisms come in many shapes and sizes, so does the DNA in their genomes. Complex organisms tend to have larger genomes, carrying more information in terms of the number of DNA bases. The plant kingdom contains the largest genomes of all, and though it will be some time before the very biggest are sequenced, the large genomes of crop plants such as maize, soybean and rice are now completed. Although annotation of the genomes will provide an overview of the protein coding sequences, regulatory sequences of crop plants are not currently accessible to automated annotation, with some relatively simple exceptions such as intron splice sites. This problem is essentially one of code breaking. The more that is known about the functions, expression and structure of genes and their products, the more the deficiencies in our knowledge about the regulatory DNA become apparent. The regulation of gene expression is the key to understanding most of the agriculturally important characteristics and responses of plants, including tolerance to environmental stresses, nutrient partitioning and morphology. Great strides have been made in understanding these systems in the model plant Arabidopsis and it is now possible to transfer many of these discoveries and methods into crop systems.

These viruses need a function endowed to the outer capsid protein to transmit outside of the insect vector cells. Assembly of each of viral proteins enables the accomplishment of the life cycle via an double-shell capsid particle. Various function of the viral proteins and their roles during their infection cycles could now be investigated, including attachment and penetration to insect vector cells, propagation in the viroplasm, intra- and inter-cell transfer, and the release of the viruses from the infected cells. The spiral organization of the liquid crystalline dsRNA, guided by the positioning of a small viral protein, allows the RNA to be processed efficiently when RDV extrudes nascent mRNA into infected cells for replications.

530,"For crops and other organisms, genetic materials are passed by genes or pieces of DNA in the genomes. The presence of genes in the production of specific proteins which determined the growth and product of plants. As could be imagined, the improvement of crops relies on the modification of the genome, either naturally or artificially. This project studies transposable elements - the  jumping genes  of plants. The genome sequence is in a certain order, and change of the order will lead to change of the function, or the emergence of new traits, which is important in agriculture. Transposable elements are one of the factors that change the order of the genome sequence. The transposable elements involved in this project are called  Pack-MULEs , which are abundant inthe genome of plants. A unique feature of Pack-MULEs is that they are capable of duplicating, reorganizing, and shuffling the DNA pieces in the genome. As a result, Pack-MULEs are potential  gene machines  for generating new genes with novel functions. Despite the abundance of Pack-MULEs and their potential in generating new traits, not much is known about how frequently Pack-MULE serve as new genes and the mechanism how they duplicate DNA pieces. With this proposal, we will determine how many of the 3,000 Pack-MULEs in rice are making protein products, which imply they are true genes. In addition, we will utilize bread yeast and genetic markers to observe how Pack-MULEs duplicate genomic sequences. Finally, we will further characterize a Pack-MULE which is shown to improve the stress tolerance of model plants and test its application in crop plants. This study may enable more powerful breeding methods and the emergence of new crop varieties.

531,"In temperate regions, the family Rosaceae ranks third in economic importance. Its commercially valuable members include fruit producing (e.g., stone fruits, apples, brambles, and strawberries), nut-producing (almond), lumber producing (e.g. black cherry) and ornamental (e.g. roses, flowering cherry, quince, and pear) species. Rosaceae is the type family for the Rosales, the largest order in the Rosidae. In the study of Rosaceae genomics, we have established a consortium of laboratories in the US and worldwide. These laboratories are carrying out research on genome organization of representative species of five genera (Malus, Prunus, Rosa, Fragaria, and Rubus). The goal of our research is to develop peach as a model genetic resource for the identification, characterization and cloning of important genes of Rosaceae species and employ comparative genomics to transfer this information into other species including strawberry, apple, raspberry etc. Although the Rosaceae is typified by broad diversity in growth habit, fruit type, reproductive traits and other important characters, we have insufficiently capitalized on this unique resource for basic research. This is in part historical in that many Rosaceae species are, in general, not easily amenable to traditional basic genetics analysis (long generation time, significant requirements of space and labor) and, in part, due to the strong emphasis of funding agencies into plants with a perceived greater potential for economic return (maize, rice, soybean). However with the introduction and application of molecular genetics technologies and the tools of genomics and transgenics, species which in the past were considered unsuitable for basic research are now moving to the forefront because they present unique opportunities to extend and enhance our understanding of the evolution of specialized gene systems and their diverse functions in different plant families (e.g. the floral genome project). It is in this regard that the Rosaceae offers one of the best systems for the comparative study of the evolution of particular plant genes systems in relation to the exploitation of specific growth habit niches. This fact has become rapidly apparent, as genomics projects on Rosaceae species have revealed that the diploid species representatives of this family have very small, compact genomes: 200 Mb strawberry, 290 Mb (raspberry), 220 MB (peach) and at the same time exhibit a huge diversity in growth form ranging from herbaceous to cane to bush to tree forms. Thus, of the plant families available for genomic scale comparative studies in respect to the adoption of particular growth forms, the Rosaceae genome (Roseome) is unparalleled. However, to exploit the Roseome for understanding the genome scale evolution of specific character states whole genome sequences of the key diploid species genomes are critical. In this regard, sequencing of two of the three genomes (strawberry, peach) has already been completed and the sequence assemblies are available to us. The remaining key genome (Rubus idaeus, the cultivated red raspberry) has also been proposed for sequencing as part of this project.

532,"The soybean crop is second only to corn in annual value in the US and was produced on approximately 76.8 million acres in 2009. Nearly half the world soybean crop is grown in the US. The US soybean crop is worth approximately twice that of wheat and 10 times that of rice. Soybean has numerous nutritional and industrial uses due to its unique seed chemical composition. With its high protein content (40%) and moderately high oil (20%), the soybean seed is the world's main source of vegetable protein and oil. It accounts for 55% of all oilseeds produced. Unfortunately soybean suffers from both biotic and abiotic stresses, and on an annual basis it suffers yield losses worth over 2 billion dollars just from biotic stresses. Therefore, improvement of soybean for disease resistance is a major priority to protect yield, growers' income and country's export and gross national product. Abiotic stress resulting in from iron deficiency chlorosis is a major problem in Iowa and much of the upper Midwest soybean producing states. In addition to improving soybean for resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses, we will investigate the basis of insect attractants of flowers for improving cross pollination between male sterile and fertile lines for producing hybrid seeds. The project uses current molecular tools in understanding the genetic components involved in the expression of resistance or tolerance of soybean against the biotic and abiotic stresses. We will apply the new knowledge to be gained from these molecular studies and conventional breeding strategies in improving soybean for resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Similarly, we will apply a genetic-molecular approach in order to decipher the genetic mechanism of pollen attraction for improving soybean for enhanced cross pollination; and thereby, higher yield from heterosis.

533,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are endogenous plant growth-promoting hormones that act at nanomolar concentrations to influence cellular expansion and proliferation and the phenotype of mutants affected in BR biosynthesis or signaling clearly show that these plant steroids are essential for normal organ elongation, vascular differentiation, reproductive development, timing of senescence, and leaf development. Given the large body of literature on application of BRs to agricultural crops and the demonstration that even minimal modulation of BR signaling or biosynthesis can have dramatic effects on rice yields and tomato fruit development, it is evident that understanding the molecular mechanisms of BR action will have practical applications in regulating the growth and development of many crop species. We previously identified mutations in a specific Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase (LRR RLK), BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), involved in hormone signal transduction in both Arabidopsis and tomato, and showed that the phenotype resulting from these mutations was essentially identical in the two species. Sequence analysis of BRI1 shows a high degree of conservation between the two species and we are currently determining the extent of functional equivalence. Our experiments will use molecular genetic and biochemical approaches to test how conserved molecular mechanisms of BR signaling are between Arabidopsis and tomato, and should provide a model for comparison of other crops. While Arabidopsis is still the best model system for global proteomic studies, tomato is rapidly becoming an excellent model system for horticultural crops with an extensive genetic map, EST sequence database and a relatively efficient procedure for transformation. It also offers unique advantages in the study of fleshy fruit development. Our experiments will provide molecular mechanisms of BR signaling in both vegetative and reproductive development of this important crop plant, and provide a model for comparison to other crops.

534,"FIRST In the absence of BLB resistant onion hybrids, the control of BLB in long-day temperate regions is chiefly achieved through intensive preventive fungicide spray programs that begin in mid-June and continue on a weekly schedule until harvest in August.. Reliance on fungicides as the primary means for control of BLB is non-sustainable and costly to growers, consumers, and the environment. The use of BLB resistant or tolerant onions would be an economically and environmentally sound component of a balanced IPM strategy to control BLB while substantially reduce use of and reliance on fungicides in onion production. SECOND Due to the biennial nature of onion, progress at transferring new traits, and creating new onion lines, can require 12 or more years. This greatly delays the exploitation of novel traits in the onion germplasm collection. The creation and use of doubled haploid lines, created from haploid cells in developing flowers, could reduce the time of line development to less than 3 years, speeding the introduction of new traits to usable onion lines and germplasm. THIRD Since each onion seed produces one onion plant, and each onion plant produces one bulb, seed production levels and onion seed availability are critical concerns, determining potential onion production. Loss of seed in onion seed is difficult to control, since the seed heads shatter easily, and the onion scapes are tall and often lodge, a tendency increased by the spread of iris yellow spot virus. Seed production of monocot grains, such as wheat and rice, were very significantly increased, resulting in the Green Revolution, by the use of dwarf genes to prevent lodging even with increased fertilizer use. The use of a dwarfed scape character in onion female lines could similarly increase attainable seed production levels, to eliminate the occurrence of seed supplies of desired onions varieties being insufficient to meet onion grower demands.

535,"Lepidopteran pests pose a constant threat to corn production. Traditionally, European corn borer has been the pest of primary concern, but in much of its range, European corn borer is being controlled by use of transgenic varieties of corn that are resistant to corn borer feeding. We are evaluating the efficacy and value of some of these lines in the face of the current European corn borer population sizes. We are also evaluating the risk posed by western bean cutworm (WBC), Striacosta albicosta, is a corn pest that has been expanding its range of activity for a little over a decade. In 1999, WBC were found feeding in experimental plots of corn throughout southwestern Minnesota (O'Rourke and Hutchison 2000). Though present in South Dakota for many years (Fauske 1982), it did not cause economic damage there until 2000 (Catangui and Berg 2004). In 2001, widespread damage to corn crops occurred throughout western Iowa (Rice 2002), and was reported for the first time in Illinois and Missouri in 2004 (Dorhout and Rice 2004). The species continues to spread eastward and is now found in Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, (Rice and Dorhout 2006, Pope 2007, DiFonzo and Hammond 2008) and Ontario (Baute, personal communication). At present, little is known about the factors that initiated and sustain this range expansion, although population genetic evidence indicates it was not due to a sudden breach of a topographical barrier (Miller et al. 2009). Research has been initiated across the current WBC range on possible reasons why its range has expanded and on an array of WBC biological, ecological, and behavioral factors that will be used to develop a comprehensive IPM program for this pest. Outcomes of our work will give growers a better understanding of the efficacy of transgenic products in the face of diminished European corn borer populations. Growers will also understand the extent of western bean cutworm populations across the state and the threat that this pest poses to their crops. bean; Behavioral; Biological; Ecology; Economics; European; Face; feeding; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Michigan; Minnesota; Missouri; Ohio; Ontario; Outcome; Personal Communication; Population; Population Genetics; Population Sizes; Production; programs; Reporting; Research; Resistance; Rice; Risk; South Dakota; Time; Transgenic Organisms; Wisconsin; WorkECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF EUROPEAN CORN BORER AND OTHER LEPIDOPTERAN PESTS OF CORN",1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.0008351583699882931,9.64756394317231e-06,0.999999
536,"Global food security is a major challenge of the 21st century. A doubling in food production in the next thirty years is required to feed the estimated 9 billion people who will inhabitant the Earth in 2050. This can only be accomplished through increases in production of crops such as rice (Oryza sativa), the grain of which feeds billions of people. Although productivity of this vital crop has more than doubled per hectare since the 1960s, a significant further enhancement of production is essential. The most feasible way this can be achieved is by developing cultivars that can produce excellent yields despite sub-optimal environmental conditions such as temperature extremes, excess minerals, soil dehydration and flooding. To make agriculture more adaptive, we need a clear understanding of the genes and cellular mechanisms that facilitate stress acclimation and tolerance. These responses are controlled by the genetic make-up of the plant. Rice improvement is likely to have a profound impact on farmers in developing nations, as well as on California rice production. Our goal is to understand the cellular mechanisms that determine fitness under adverse growth conditions. The research project will focus on signaling mechanisms initiated by abiotic stress that result in altered gene regulation. We will further elucidate the sensing and response to flooding and other abiotic stresses in rice and the model plant Arabidopsis. The project will also develop and implement technology for high-resolution evaluation of gene expression and protein synthesis. The project will also study the function of genes that are poorly characterized in plants, but play a role in the response to abiotic stress.

537,"Modern society generates tremendous amounts of waste through industry and agriculture. This waste, if left untreated, causes a detrimental impact to human health and the environment. Appropriate disposal of industrial, agricultural, and municipal wastes is imperative for environmental safety. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a technological innovation that takes advantage of naturally occurring microbial anaerobic metabolism in order to reduce organic waste pollution. The anaerobic degradation of organic wastes produces biogas, mainly composed of methane, which is a renewable source of bioenergy (Sekigushi et al., 2001; Angenent et al., 2004). The methane produced can be used for the production of electricity and heat (Stafford, 1992). These tasks are accomplished with minimal environmental and health impact (Ahring, 2003). Anaerobic digestion is a desirable cost effective means of treating organic wastes (Narihiro and Sekiguchi, 2007). Organic waste is produced in mass quantities across the world as a byproduct of agriculture. This waste becomes problematic as it pollutes the air and water supplies. Swine, poultry and cattle waste has polluted 35,000 miles of U.S. rivers and has contaminated ground water in 17 states (USDA and US EPA, 1998). Over 335 million tons of manure is produced on U.S. farms every year (USDA, 2005). The West Virginia poultry industry produces 145,000 tons of chicken waste every year (U.S. EPA, 1999). Poultry house waste includes manure, litter, waste feed, dead birds, beaks, and feathers. Litter is the bedding used in poultry houses during production. Poultry litter may consist of sawdust, wood chips, shredded paper, straw, peanut, or rice hulls and is mixed with the poultry excrement during the production cycle. At the end of the production cycle, the manure and litters are removed from the poultry house and must be disposed. Post-production poultry litter has been used as an agricultural soil amendment thereby recycling nutrients (Keller et al. 2002). However, overuse of untreated litter results in air pollution, contamination of ground waters, spread of pathogens, and uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions (Kelleher et al., 2002). West Virginia poultry waste generation has contributed to the pollution of two major water sources: the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay (U.S. EPA, 1999). Anaerobic digestion (AD) technologies take advantage of naturally occurring microbial metabolic processes to treat industrial and agricultural wastes. While AD has been in use for over a century, the technology continues to be plagued with issues of instability. Greater stability of these systems would allow for more wide-spread use of AD technologies. External disturbance continues to be an issue with maintaining digester stability. This study will utilize controlled external disturbances to the benefit of AD. Controlled disturbances will be used to cultivate greater digester microbial diversity and flexibility. This in turn will create a more stable and resilient digester.

538,"Objective A: Laboratory Studies: Experiments will be conducted to assess the newly developed soil testing techniques for the identification of potentially mineralizable-N. Procedures will include both aerobic and anaerobic incubation procedures as well as correlation with existing indices of N availability. Field Study: Soil samples down to a 60-cm depth in 15-cm increments will be collected from N rate trials across Arkansas for wheat, corn, rice, and grain sorghum. Zero N fertilizer plots will be used to determine if any of the soil N liberated by the analytical methods correlates with the plant's total N accumulation and grain yield. The N fertilizer rates will range from low to high in six incremental steps. Measurement parameters will include grain yield, grain quality, dry matter production, total nutrient uptake and lodging. Objective B: Greenhouse Studies: A series of greenhouse studies will be implemented to determine the optimum height and growth stage for sensing cereal crops in the Delta region of the Midsouth. Comparison of NDVI values with plant TN uptake as well as other indicators of crop nutrient status, such as chlorophyll meters, will be conducted to determine the ability of these technologies to correlate with crop response. Soils with varying degrees of native N release will be selected and utilized for the greenhouse experiments. Field Studies: Response trials will be implemented across the state. Treatments will consist of varying rates and applications of N, which will allow determination of the response index (RI) and harvest index (HI) for each site. Plant samples will be collected to determine TN uptake and correlated with NDVI values to estimate fertilizer N use efficiency. Grain yield, grain quality, lodging and disease incidence will also be quantified to determine their relationship with NDVI. Objective C: Laboratory Studies: A series of experiments will be conducted to assess the N credits and debits from previous crops, cover crops and green manures that are commonly utilized in the Midsouth. Procedures will include both aerobic and anaerobic incubation procedures as well as correlation with existing indices of N availability and comparison to known estimates of N such as TN and KCl extracts. Various crop residues will be labeled with 15N to allow more precise estimations of the N quantified by diffusion and direct steam distillation procedures and track N movement from residue through different pools of N available in the soil. Greenhouse Study: 15N labeled residues will be added to the soil and allowed to mineralize for a period of time before a successive crop is planted to determine the rate at which different residues breakdown and are subsequently taken up by a following crop. Field Study: Several field studies involving crop rotation with various cover and green manure crops will be established to determine the benefits of utilizing these practices for increased nutrient availability as well as retention of nutrients under varying climatic conditions.

539,"Rice has been an important crop for Southeast Missouri as well as other states. But according to recent studies, further increases in production are jeopardized mainly by increasing costs of inputs, climate change effects, environmental pollution issues and water scarcity. The rapid increase in greenhouse gases presents increased global temperature on rice production. Despite the positive CO2 fertilization effect via photosynthesis, the decrease in net biomass productivity and increased floral sterility at high temperatures can severely reduce use-efficiency of water and nutrients and decrease yield. Therefore, main goal of this project is how rice production affects and is affected by environmental issues and climate change and sustainable rice production. The objectives of this project are: 1) to evaluate best management practices of water saving practices, soil and nutrients management for sustainable and profitable rice production systems, 2) to evaluate greenhouse gases emissions and carbon sequestration from water, residues and nutrient management practices for rice production systems. , 3) to develop a low-cost rice biomass pyrolysis system and associated procedures for producing biochar and bio-oil using crop biomass as a feedstock and 4) to evaluate varietal and management effects on production of rice and to improve quality of rice grown in Southeast Missouri. Experimental studies of sustainable and profitable rice production systems will be determined for 2011-2015. Summaries of data over years will be published.

540,"Citrus is a very important agricultural commodity of Florida. Florida production accounts for 55% of the U.S. production. U.S. production was valued at $2.74B in 2008-09 with an on-tree production value in Florida of $993M (NASS, 2010). Florida ranks #1 in US and #2 in world orange production. Citrus contributes about $9B annually, employees 76,000, and based on 2009 estimates, comprises 568,814 acres (NASS, 2010). Weeds are one of the major constraints in citrus production. Weeds cause damage to citrus trees by impacting yield through competition for nutrient, water, and light and serve as an alternate host for other pests such as insects and diseases. Weeds also impede grove and harvesting operations, thereby increasing the cost of production. Abundant moisture, high temperatures, and frequent fertilizer applications provides a very good environment for the growth and occurrence of weeds in citrus groves, especially in Florida (Singh and Sharma, 2008). Control of weeds in citrus groves is a major concern. Although a variety of weed control strategies are available, chemical control remains to be the most effective and cost-effective way to combat weeds. In citrus production, total annual cost of production amounts to $1,565.83/acre, 10% of which goes to weed control and herbicide costs (Muraro, 2009). Due to very limited herbicide options in citrus production, glyphosate remains the most important and frequently used herbicide in citrus production. Areas treated with glyphosate are increasing annually. In 2009, 72% of orange and 63% of grapefruit groves were treated with glyphosate, emphasizing the importance of glyphosate as a major herbicide option for citrus groves (NASS, 2010). Alternatives to chemical control, such as the use of various types of mulch and cultivation, were found to provide excellent weed control. In Egypt, Abouziena et al. (2008) reported that greatest control of weeds was achieved with the use of plastic mulch and three-layer mulch of rice straw and cattail. Cultivation and hand hoeing did not provide sufficient weed control since mandarin yield was still lower than mulching. However, cost-effectiveness of these alternatives, as well as impact on the environment should be investigated before these could be recommended to citrus growers most especially those in organic production systems.

542,"Maize, wheat, rice and sorghum, all Poaceae species, are significant contributors to world and U.S. agriculture. In addition, other Poaceae species including Miscanthus and switchgrass are being considered for biofuel feedstock production due to their lignocellulosic biomass production. Major increases in the yield, quality, and disease/pest resistance of maize, wheat, and rice have occurred in the last 50 years due to conventional breeding, improved agricultural management practices, and transgenic technologies. However, to meet growing worldwide food and potentially biomass needs, production needs to be further increased. One approach to improve breeding practices is through accelerated or targeted breeding approaches such as marker assisted selection which relies on molecular markers to facilitate selection of improved lines in a breeding program. With the advent of genomics, including next generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, genome sequences and molecular markers can be generated in not only a high throughput but also in a cost effective manner. Providing data and research tools to plant breeders and biologists that enable genomic-based plant breeding will be essential to improved agriculture in the 21st century.

543,"High-throughput genomic technologies in plant sciences generate vast amounts of DNA sequence data from diverse plants as well as genotypic variability within a crop. In addition, functional genomics information on gene expression is generated, describing different stages, conditions and responses of plants. Analysis of this data will provide new tools and knowledge to improve sustainable crop production in our changing environment. Abiotic and biotic stress resistance/tolerance, yield stability, and quality or composition of rice products will be studied. Traits such as drought resistance and water use efficiency are complex and need to be studied in a holistic integrated manner. Rice genotypes, differing in phenotype for these traits and components will be developed from crosses of diverse germplasm, or selected as mutations of candidate genes for the trait. The different genotypes, displaying quantitative phenotypic differences for the traits, will be used in progressive steps to characterize the association of candidate genes to trait phenotypes. Candidate genes for the traits will be validated by multiple criteria. This integrated analysis will provide an understanding of the biology of these traits. The Outcomes of the project will be - 1: the identification of genes involved in traits for sustainable rice and cereal crop production, and 2: the identification of genetic variation within the germplasm that can be used by breeders to select genotypes for trait improvement. The Impact of the project will be the potential development of future rice and cereal cultivars with improved environmental stress tolerance and yield stability.

546,"By documenting SOC accumulation under different climates, land uses, and soils, it is expected that the results of this project will provide producers, policy makers, and the CCX credible and comprehensive information on the environmental merit of adopting different land uses such as bio-energy crops and conservation-tillage practices in the southern US. It is also expected that the project will facilitate the establishment of a C-trading farm economy in the southern US by providing credible and realistic data on soil C sequestration potentials. Aside from the information and data to be generated, the activities associated with this project will promote teaching, training, and learning at both the graduate and undergraduate student levels. It is expected that the project cooperators will involve their undergraduate students in field activities, such as collecting soil samples, and in laboratory activities, such as processing samples and conducting analyses. Undergraduate students will also have the opportunity to compile data under mentorship of graduate students and/or the project collaborator. Once a year, these participating students would have the opportunity to present a summary of their results in a teleconference with the working group or in-person during regular annual meetings. This type of activity provides students with some experience in basic statistics and presentation skills. It also provides an opportunity for students to interact with a geographically diverse group of faculty, researchers, and other students across the states and institutions involved in this project. The experimental infrastructure to be created will enhance education, research, and collaboration between the southern Universities, federal agencies, such as the Natural Resource Conservation Service's Soil Survey Division, which is very interested in compiling databases on benchmark soils and dynamic soil properties such as soil C, and/or the US Forest Service, and other state and local agencies involved in natural resource conservation and management. The USDA's Voluntary Reporting Carbon Management Tool (COMET-VR) is one such database of soil C sequestration, which uses data compiled from the Carbon Sequestration Rural Appraisal along with the Century model (Parton et al., 1988) to estimate annual C fluxes (USDA, 2007; Milne et al., 2008). However, one current limitation of the Century model is that little soil C sequestration data is available for areas where flood-irrigated rice is a main row-crop, such as in areas of Texas, California, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana (Milne et al., 2008). Thus, improving our understanding of the relationships among climates, soils, land uses, and C will contribute to increased awareness and protection of our natural resources and improve the quality of our air, soil, and water for future generations. It is also anticipated that this information will lead to increased on-farm profits for those producers who chose to use more-sustainable land management practices.

547,"This Hatch Project Proposal focuses on the investigation of traits that can serve as selection criteria in breeding for high yield in inbred and hybrid rice, in identifying parental donors in inbred and hybrid rice breeding, and in developing heterotic groups and parents for hybrid breeding. The project is based on the ideotype approach of improving inbred rice lines, both the ideotype and heterotic group approaches on improving hybrid rice, and the analyses of genotype x environment (GE) and genotype x trait (GT) interactions in identifying high performing and stable trait donors as parents for hybridization, and inbred and hybrid rice lines. Ideotype and hybrid breeding are two of the approaches suggested for increasing yield potential of rice, which is consumed by more than half of the world's population. An ideotype or ideal plant type provides the selection criteria that breeders have to target to improve yield. Rice cultivar IR8, released in 1967 by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), is a semi-dwarf plant type that triggered the rice Green Revolution. Currently, IRRI is working on improved ideotypes, called the New Plant Type, to break through the rice yield plateau. China is breeding its rice ideotype, called the  Super Rice . Research at the Texas AgriLife Research Center at Beaumont have suggested the trait combinations to increase yield, and some of the suggested traits (such as long maturity, higher leaf area index, and high panicle density) are now commonly found in the commercial hybrids grown in Texas. Rice hybrids have a yield advantage over inbred rice due to positive heterosis. The magnitude of a hybrid's heterosis depends on its parents' subspecies and the trend is indica/japonica > indica/javanica > japonica/javanica > indica/indica > japonica/japonica. However, low seed set may occur in hybrids of inter-subspecies crosses. Hence, it was suggested that indica-inclined and japonica-inclined rice lines be developed and used as parents of hybrids. It is largely through trial-and-error that promising rice hybrids are produced. Heterotic groups can be used to enhance heterosis, but these are not being used in hybrid rice breeding. A heterotic group is a set of inbred lines having high kinship coefficients, similar traits, and high combining abilities. Hybrids of crosses between lines of different heterotic groups are expected to have significant heterosis. Parents of hybrids should also be selected for high yield, good general combining ability, and moderate genetic differences. An ideal cultivar is high yielding and adaptable to a wide range of environments. However, GE interaction, i.e., cultivars perform differently in different environments, is commonly observed. Hence, there is the need to select for high performing and stable inbreds, hybrids, and parents of hybrids, not just for grain yield but for the breeding selection criteria as well. The genotype plus genotype x environment (GGE) and the GT biplot analyses are useful in identifying the  winning  cultivar for each environment tested and in identifying rice genotypes that can serve as stable donors of specific yield-related traits, respectively.

548,"Mississippi ranks fourth in the USA in rice acreage. In 2010, the fourth largest acreage was planted which was approximately 125,000 hectares. The clay soils, abundant water, and a favorable climate have proven effective for rice production. Rice has become an important part of the Delta farming system. Furthermore, since approximately 50% of the rice produced in Mississippi is exported to other countries, Mississippi rice production is also important internationally. This research project will emphasize research in agronomic practices for rice production in Mississippi. Cultivar/hybrid development plays a large role in increasing yields, which often increases the profitability for the rice producer. It is imperative to evaluate cultivars and hybrids for nutrient response, row spacing, seeding rates, etc. to maximize the genetic potential from which yields and quality are greatly improved. Since sustainable productivity and environmental policy are the key issues for Mississippi agriculture, each factor that is involved in producing rice must be evaluated to maintain a balanced production system. More specifically, land-grant university nutrient recommendations are becoming more important in establishing environmental law; therefore, it is imperative to continually refine nutrient recommendations for various production scenarios so these key issues are addressed concomitantly. This research project will help develop the best agronomic practices under varying production systems for new cultivars, fertilizer sources, soil amendments, and plant growth regulators. Furthermore, the soil environment can vary extensively which affects nutrient dynamics. More basic laboratory investigations will be conducted to help model nitrogen loss mechanisms and determine tools to offset nitrogen loss.New technologies are being developed by MSU, other land-grant institutions, and industry. The nitrogen soil test for rice (N-ST*R) has been developed by the University of Arkansas, and is being validated in Mississippi. Additionally, MSU has helped to develop the prediction model for Greenseeker (a tool that looks at ability of the rice crop's canopy to reflect energy), which promises the potential for growers to apply N fertilizer on an as needed basis once rice reaches the reproductive growth stage. As these and other new technologies are developed, our program is in place to refine the technology in a grower friendly manner.

549,"Non-Technical Summary. In cereal grains, the mature seeds are mostly composed of endosperm that is biologically and economically important. In all angiosperms, endosperm provides nutrients and signals to the embryo during seed development and germination. The economic significance of cereal endosperm is its high composition of carbohydrates and proteins, which is an important source of food, feed, and industrial raw materials. Approximately 50% of human calories are derived from cereal endosperm, either directly or indirectly through animal feed. Furthermore, cereal endosperm is used as a raw material for numerous industrial products, including ethanol. Maize is the most important staple food with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed by large proportion of world's human population. Maize has a long history to be used as an excellent model system for genetics which studies the DNA variation in genes and the regulatory sequences leading to changes of gene expression. Compared to genetic variation, epigenetic modification is another layer of regulatory mechanism that controls gene expression through the chemical modification of chromatin states, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, without altering the DNA sequences. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the maize endosperm development, and identify the important genes regulating the developmental process. Therefore, the genome-wide identification of the important genes controlling maize seed development will fundamentally advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and will benefit the improvement of grain yield and nutritional quality. In this proposal, we will use a modern biotechnology called Next-Generation high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the activity of all the 50,000 genes in maize and identify the genes carrying important regulatory chemical modification during the development of maize seed. By analyzing the highly integrated biological data produced in this project, we will develop a series of computational models and algorithms to identify a set of important genes called  transcription factors  that regulate the biological processes of seed development. All these genes and the tools will be implemented as a database, so that the agricultural biologists and the interested researchers can access the data, and select the genes for the bio-engineering experiments. The genes playing similar roles will be also identified in wheat, rice, barley, and other important crops using computational methods and a variety of bioinformatics software. The important genes and knowledge obtained from the proposed experiments can potentially be applied to other cereals and has the promise of guiding further efforts to enhance endosperm content and quality in crop plants.

Objective 2: Develop antifungal candidate genes and gene constructs that can be used in targeted expression system to develop Fusarium-resistant barley. Objective 3: Identify components of the GA response that can be used as predictors of malting.Approach:   Produce gene macroarrays from our lemma-specific gene library and a new epicarpspecific library. Probe libraries with cDNA from Fusarium-infected lemma and epicarp. Clone and identify the upregulated genes, and confirm tissue-specificity with RNA blots. A modified inverse PCR will be used to clone their promoters from barley. Promoter (upstream) regions will be ligated upstream of the green fluorescent protein gene in an expression vector and functionally confirmed in transient bombardment assays where tissues will be examined for fluorescence before and after infection with Fusarium. If successful, barley will be stably transformed with antifungal protein genes driven by these promoters using the Agrobacterium vector pRSHyg. These genes (cloned in this lab) include lemma thionin, Ltp, and germin. Transformants will be tested for Fusarium resistance. The gene for the barley gibberellin (GA) hormone receptor will be cloned using homologies to the rice receptor. The gene will be compared in GA response mutants. Receptor sequence and mRNA levels will be analyzed in barleys of varying malting qualities. The Barley1 GeneChip will be used to examine transcripts in 7 malting barleys and GA response mutants.

551,"Objective(s): The long-term objective of this project is to identify and chemically characterize secondary metabolites from natural sources with nutraceutical and/or pesticidal properties as chemical markers for selection of high value crops and/or lead compounds for structure-activity optimization. Over the next 5 years, we will focus on the following objectives: Objective 1. Profile phytochemicals of selected crops (blueberry and rice) to identify species or cultivars with high contents of compounds with beneficial health and/or fungicidal properties to promote development as high value crops. Objective 2. Discover and identify technologies based on secondary metabolites that facilitate the development of commercially viable herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, insect repellants, fish bacterides, and health promoters.Approach:   Blueberry and rice samples will be extracted with appropriate solvents and the extracts will be analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, as well as by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The extracts will also be tested for antioxidant activity using a cell-based antioxidant assay. The chemical profiles of the extracts will be correlated with disease resistance of the samples, as well as antioxidant activity. A bioassay-guided investigative approach will be performed on bioactive extracts in efforts to discover herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, insect repellents, fish bactericides and health promoters. General procedures for isolation of active compounds such as solvent extractions, distillations, column chromatography and thin layer chromatography will be employed. Extracts, fractions and pure compounds will be tested for phytotoxicity, antifungal and insecticidal activity in assays being carried out routinely at NPURU and at collaborator's laboratories.

552,"Objective(s): Our overall objective is to maintain and improve grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles. Most of our work concentrates on measuring properties of single kernels so that they can be segregated or the distribution of properties in a sample can be ascertained, versus measuring the average quality of a bulk sample. In general, the project will include the development of instruments to improve rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) measurement of grain quality at receiving stations, the development of non-destructive and rapid (up to 500 kernels/s) single-kernel sorting systems to improve post-harvest grain quality and similar systems to help grain breeders rapidly select specific traits for improved lines, and improve grain-storage and handling systems. Specific objectives are: 1. Develop sensors and methods to rapidly and accurately quantify attributes such as protein composition, starch composition, end-use quality, toxins, and micronutrients. 1.A. Develop or apply spectroscopic technologies that offer significant improvements over current technologies used to measure traits of single kernels and other biological materials. 1.B. Adapt a previously developed conductance mill for detection of live-insect infestations in wheat in other grains such as corn, rice, barley, and oats, and to dry beans, such as pinto and navy beans. 1.C. Develop procedures for rapid estimation of insect fragments in milled flour from minimally processed whole wheat. 2.Develop rapid single-kernel sorting systems to accurately remove defects such as fungal or insect-damaged grain and to isolate beneficial traits such as white wheat. 2.A. Develop high-speed, low-cost, image-based sorting systems for a variety of grains and legumes. 2.B. Develop Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) -based, single-seed sorting systems for large grains and legumes. 2.C. Investigate applications of single-kernel NIRS technology to select kernels with specific traits. 3. Develop instrumentation, sensors, and systems to improve monitoring, and management of grain storage. 3.A. Develop traceability and identity-preservation techniques for grain handling. 3.B. Develop new stored-grain packing factors for the common grains in trade with known confidence intervals for a complete range of field conditions. 3.C. Investigate insect-pest densities and commingling of insects in grain that causes the spread of an infestation from bucket elevator boots. 3.D. Develop monitoring systems for grain-storage quality management. 3.E. Develop improved, environmentally-friendly insect-pest control methods for stored grain. While the objectives of this project include pre-harvest (seeds) and post-harvest handling of grain, the work is interconnected in that the overall goal is to improve the quality of grain produced in the United States. Instruments developed to assess grain quality will be used to study how grain quality might change during storage and handling. An instrument previously developed by this group to detect insect-infested grain will be used to study the spread of insect infestations and the storability of grain based on insect population levels.Approach:   U.S. farmers grow over 15 billion bushels of corn, wheat, soybeans, and other grains annually to supply the nation and world with food, animal feed, and biofuels. A significant amount of this grain may be stored for a year or more before it is used or processed. Our goal is to improve U.S. grain quality and international competitiveness through the application of engineering principles, specifically to the areas of rapid (inspection results from at least 60 individual kernels per minute) quality measurement and in maintaining quality during storage. Much of our research concentrates on measuring the distribution of quality within samples, and on detecting traits that are present at very low levels. We propose to develop instruments to rapidly (up to 500 kernels/s) measure quality traits for inspection at the first point of grain delivery, for breeders in selecting traits for new lines, and for processors prior to grain buying or processing. We also propose to develop chemical-free technology to control insects and maintain quality during handing and storage. This research will lead to higher profits for the agriculture sector, higher-quality foods reaching consumers, and more food available for a growing world population.

Breads and other baked products will be developed from non-gluten whole grains and bran such as corn, rice, oat, barley, rye, quinoa, amaranth in order to increase the diversity of whole grain products available to consumers. Viscous soluble dietary fibers are necessary to replace gluten, but also reduce postprandial glycemic response and plasma cholesterol. Sub-Objective 3.2. Preliminary studies indicate difference in hepatic nutrient metabolism between wheat and barley flours was not accounted for by soluble fiber content. We propose to evaluate a variety of cereal grains and seeds for bioactivity by analyzing expression of hepatic genes representative of metabolism of sterols, bile acids, and fat, and indicators of inflammation.Approach:   Food processing technologies will be applied to release the high concentration of polyphenolic components from the matrices of the skin and bran byproducts of juice, wine, oil and flour production. Polyphenolics will be extracted from these processed matrices by systematic application of food grade solvents into broad classes and a fiber fraction. Mice and hamster models of obesity related diseases will be used to determine the potential of the polyphenolic or fiber fractions to reduce or prevent the characteristics of metabolic diseases. Mechanisms will be investigated through gene expression pathway analysis. Of particular interest is the ability of polyphenolics or fiber to reduce the absorption of lipopolysaccharides that trigger adipose inflammatory responses. Viscous soluble fibers will be used to develop breads from nontraditional whole grains and seeds to determine if they have potential to reduce metabolic syndrome in animal models. 6-Phytase; absorption; Accounting; Adipose tissue; Alcohols; Animal Model; Avena sativa; base; Bile Acids; Bioavailable; Biological Availability; Bread; Cells; cellulase; Cellulases; Cereals; Characteristics; Cholesterol; Complex Mixtures; Dental Pulp; Diet; Dietary Fiber; esterase; Ethanol; Fatty acid glycerol esters; feeding; Fiber; Flour; Food; Food Processing; Fruit; fruits and vegetables; Gel; Gene Expression; Genes; Germ; Gluten; Grapes; Hamsters; Hepatic; High Pressure Liquid Chromatography; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory Response; interest; Juice; Lipids; Lipopolysaccharides; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolic syndrome; Metabolism; Methods; Micronutrients; Modeling; Mus; nutrient metabolism; Oats; Obesity; Obesity associated disease; Oils; Olives - dietary; Pathway Analysis; physical process; Physiological; Phytochemical; Plasma; pressure; prevent; Process; Production; Quinoa; response; Rice; Rye cereal; Sampling; Seeds; Skin; Skin Tissue; soluble fiber; Solvents; Sonication; Sterols; Technology; Testing; Water; Weight Gain; Wheat; WinePROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES TO PREVENT WEIGHT GAIN AND OBESITY RELATED METABOLIC DISEASES",1e-06,0.9986896746771278,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06

556,"Objective(s): Objective 1: Characterize the influence of zinc and iron concentrations in edible crop tissues and crop species on the bioavailability of crop cadmium to animals (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 2: Characterize the potential transfer of soil lead, arsenic, and other trace elements by vegetable crops grown on element enriched urban and orchard soils and develop methods to prevent this transfer. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 3: Characterize genetic resources and inheritance of grain Cd to reduce cadmium in durum wheat, flax and soybean. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 4: Evaluate information about the risk from Cd in foods to support public decisions for foods of both plant and animal origin. (C1; PS 1.F). The ultimate goals of this Project Plan are to improve the science about risk of heavy metals in soils and crops in order to obtain improved regulatory limits for Cd in crops under Codex, and the information needed to provide improved advice about the risk of Pb in urban garden soils and crops. Essentially all human Cd disease from soil Cd has resulted from paddy rice grown on fields contaminated by mining or smelter emissions. Garden vegetables and other grains have not been found to induce Cd disease in highly exposed populations who grow crops on highly Cd+Zn contaminated soils. Some Europeans want to set crop Cd limits based on ôattainableö levels rather than on the basis of potential risk to consumers. Such non-risk based standards will harm U.S. growers of durum wheat, sunflower kernels, flax, soybean, and some other crops. If crops must contain lower levels of Cd to win importation by other nations, both soil treatments, selection of soil series which produce lower Cd crops, and improved cultivars which accumulate lower amounts of Cd will contribute to growers needs. Providing a clear technical basis for the bioavailability of Cd in different crops appears to be the central issue which could change the demand for lower limits for crop Cd, and protect growers from unnecessary costs to produce lower Cd crops which may have no benefit. Only animal feeding tests can provide valid information about the bioavailability of crop Cd to animals, and the concentrations fed must represent levels in foods rather than toxic levels fed in most previous research. Because Zn is usually greatly increased in crops (except rice) when Cd is increased, the presence of Zn may substantially reduce the bioavailability of crop Cd, alleviating presumed risk of crop Cd. Because commercial carrots were found with higher than normal Pb concentrations when grown on historic orchard soils, U.S.-FDA requested that ARS examine the basis for carrot Pb accumulation and to learn if agricultural amendments can reduce carrot Pb when they are grown on high Pb soils. Certain root crops have xylem elements growing through the edible storage root, so if Pb is trapped within the xylem during normal growth of the crop, it will be in the edible root. But such Pb might have much lower bioavailability than the Pb-acetate used to establish diet Pb risk; 2-10% of food Pb is absorbed, while 60-80% of soluble Pb in water is absorbed by human volunteers.  Approach: Characterize the influence of zinc and iron concentrations in edible crop tissues and crop species on the bioavailability of crop cadmium to animals.  Zinc incorporated in lettuce reduces weanling rat absorption of lettuce Cd.  Using controlled chelator-buffered nutrient solutions (similar to Kukier and Chaney, 2002), Romaine lettuce will be grown to contain basal and sub-phytotoxic concentrations of foliar Zn (25 and 450 mg kg-1 DW), and the Codex Cd limit (4 mg Cd kg-1 DW); the high Zn represents maximum Zn levels normally present if lettuce is grown in acidic soils with geogenic Cd+Zn contamination at the beginning of yield reduction due to Zn phytotoxicity. Fe concentration in lettuce is tightly controlled genetically, but lettuce can supply higher bioavailable Fe than the marginal AIN diet, and thus plant Fe can reduce Cd bioavailability. The lettuce will be fed to weanling rats following the protocol of Reeves and Chaney (2004) in which American Institute of Nutrition (AIN) purified diets with marginal or adequate Fe-Zn-Ca were fed. The basal and high Zn lettuce will be mixed with both the marginal and adequate diets and fed for 28 days without radioisotope labeling used previously. At autopsy, the liver, kidney and duodenum will be removed for analysis. Tissues and blood will be tested to establish Fe status of the test animals. The tissues will be digested in HNO3, and Cd, Zn and Fe levels measured by ICP-Atomic Emission Spectrometry or ICP-Mass Spectrometry. Eight replicate rats will be fed each diet to accommodate the natural variation in such feeding tests (Reeves and Chaney, 2001).

557,"Objective(s): 1) Quantify the effects of soil management practices and amendments, including humic substances, to enhance soil organic matter and carbon and nitrogen dynamics for improving soil productivity. 2) Measure the impact of soil management practices that will increase soil aggregation, reduce compaction, affect crusting, and minimize trace gas exchange processes within Midwestern soils for enhanced soil productivity and environmental quality. 3) Develop sustainable biofuel feedstock production systems using soil quality assessment tools to ensure the practices sustain productivity and protect soil, water and air resources.  Approach: Biochemical analyses will be used to distinguish between labile and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter to improve the knowledge base regarding the effects of residue management on short-term soil processes (nutrient cycling, soil structure, and crust formation) and long-term carbon sequestration. This basic knowledge will then be applied to current production problems associated with providing sustainable supplies of bioenergy feedstock and enhancing grain yields to help meet ever-increasing food and feed demands. Utilizing corn, soybean, and small grain (i.e. rice, rye, and wheat) cropping systems, soil management practices to increase corn growth and grain yield will be evaluated in multiple field experiments. Various single-pass corn stover harvest and crop management strategies, cover crops, crop rotations, and tillage intensity will provide the crop production systems within which soil quality will be measured and the chemical nature and cycling of soil organic matter fractions will be quantified using seasonal analyses of amino acids, amino sugars, carbohydrates, phenols, and fatty acids. Effects of soil aeration on the decomposition of crop residues and the subsequent quality of soil organic matter, efficiency of nitrogen (N) cycling, and crop grain yield will be quantified in these experiments. The soil biochemical measurements coupled with soil physical process measurements will be used to augment the knowledge base related to soil quality assessment at plot scales for potential extension to field scale assessments. Project results will quantify the effects of crop residue management on soil physical and biochemical properties contributing to economic yields and long-term sustainability of major cereal cropping systems, leading to improved soil management practices.

558,"This project establishes a framework necessary for understanding the interactions, connectivity and interdependence of humans and a changing water system in the lower Mekong River Basin of Southeast Asia. The cross-disciplinary team of experts creates future scenarios of change, develops an innovative and integrative modeling framework, and defines the data collection efforts needed to evaluate how sustainability of the water system affects human welfare. This question is how to promote human well-being in a region dependent on a changing water system. The Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia are connected through a flood-pulse hydrology and river-floodplain connectivity upon which humans are dependent for rice farming, fish production, and social lifeways. Current rapid changes in land use, hydropower development, human activity, and climate will all have significant impacts on the predictability of the flood-pulse system and the availability of water in the future. This research connects the natural and human system through the study of the ecosystem services provided by the water system, which in turn support and sustain human life. Through the assembled team, the research focuses on all dimensions of the region?s ecosystem services including the provision, adaptation, valuation, and response mechanisms. The results of this project will set the stage to measure and explain critical interactions and impacts of a social-ecological system on the brink of profound transformation driven by demographic shifts, rapid economic growth, hydropower installations and climate change.  This research develops a framework to answer the central research questions: (1) What is the set of likely future land-use and climate scenarios for the region and how will they affect the hydrological system? (2) What is the relationship between the hydrological system and the generation of the ecosystem services necessary for sustainable agricultural production? (3) How do human populations depend on the ecosystem services provided by the hydrological system and respond to changes in the provision of these ecosystem services? and, (4) What are the tradeoffs associated with alternative choices for water sustainability? This project will serve as a precursor to a more significant NSF WSC Category 2 proposal, in which the data and modeling framework will be implemented to assess the physical and economic ecosystem service tradeoffs associated with alternative approaches to ensuring water sustainability in the region.  This research develops a set of plausible future scenarios based on climate change, land use, and human activity in the Lower Mekong Region. A cross-discplinary team of experts develops integrative ecological-economic models to assess the consequences of changes on human well-being. While ecosystem services provide a useful and innovative way of understanding the linkages and feedback of natural systems and humans populations, measuring and quantifying the value of these services ia challenging. The models developed are adaptable to other ecosystem service applications.

559,"Water scarcity is a growing concern in the U.S. and throughout the world, affecting an estimated one third of the population on every continent. The problem is particularly urgent in developing countries heavily reliant on agriculture, which can account for as much as 85-90% of fresh water usage. Effective water resource management has significant implications for food security, health, and worldwide political stability. This is increasingly important in the face of a growing population, dramatic shifts in land use, and changing climatic conditions. Historically, the world?s farmers have relied on traditional practices to manage water, but now find themselves challenged by new conditions that require adaptation to these farming practices. Understanding the complex array of factors?psychological, social, environmental, and political?that facilitate and constrain effective adaptation requires an integrated research agenda that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. This research draws upon the core disciplines of psychology, sociology, hydrology, and engineering in order to investigate these issues among paddy farmers within the Mahaweli River Watershed, Sri Lanka?a largely agricultural region that is a microcosm of the sort of massive changes occurring throughout the world in environmental, institutional, and social systems. These changes include impacts of drought as well as an ongoing national resettlement plan to populate and develop regions of the watershed. The research team will use a multi-level, multi-method approach that incorporates longitudinal farmer surveys, regional level drought indices (coupled with short- and long-term drought forecast methods), key informant interviews, and archival analysis. The research team will investigate how farmers adapt to changing water availability and how these decisions are affected by psychological, social, institutional, and environmental factors. The team will examine water availability and rice yields in light of farmers? adaptive actions, changing rainfall and temperature patterns, land use changes, and water allocation decisions. These multiple streams of data will be integrated using agent-based modeling to generate a rich set of future scenarios to characterize how changes to social and institutional circumstances and in the natural environment may affect farmers' adaptive actions and their effectiveness in managing vulnerability to water scarcity. This project will not only advance our theoretical knowledge within and across disciplines; it will provide much needed practical information about sustainable water resource management to farmers and decision makers in a developing country where water scarcities have major implications for food security. A recent report from the U.S. National Intelligence Agency looking forward to the year 2040 concludes: ?Water problems will hinder the ability of key countries to produce food and generate energy, posing a risk to global food markets and hobbling economic growth.? This research is directed towards averting the worst of such consequences by furthering the knowledge of farmers, local community leaders, national governmental leaders, and researchers about strategies to reduce water stresses and facilitate adaptation. Additionally, the team has incorporated a major educational aspect in the project to train the next generation of scholars in a thoroughly interdisciplinary framework. As such, they will be mentored not only in theory and methodology but also in how to communicate research to diverse audiences, including policymakers and some of the world?s most vulnerable populations.

The traits conferring these C4 advantages are (1) cooperation of two distinct photosynthetic cell types (mesophyll and bundle sheath) for carbon fixation and photosynthesis, (2) enhanced movement of metabolites between cooperating cells, and (3) high density of leaf venation. These C4 traits are produced from genetic resources already present in less-efficient C3 plants, but regulated in more efficient patterns. Although C4 plants have evolved at least 50 times independently in various taxonomic groups, the molecular basis of the more efficient C4 regulatory system is insufficiently understood to extend its advantages to other crops and biofuel feedstocks. A systems-level analysis of RNAs, proteins, metabolites, anatomy and physiology of corresponding developmental stages of maize (C4) and rice (C3) leaves has identified many of the molecular resources that produce the C4 traits.  It has also revealed that additional corresponding data about small regulatory RNAs, epigenetic differences among cell types, protein modifications and several other  data channels  are needed to understand the production and regulation of these traits. In addition, more sophisticated computational approaches are needed to integrate the many  channels  of RNA, protein, anatomical and small molecule information that produce complex traits. This project will (1) obtain the missing data channels for C4 leaf developmental stages  (2) utilize novel computational approaches for the integration of data channels and the modeling of regulatory networks that can be tested experimentally, and (3) test the regulatory basis for several C4 biochemical cellular traits by genetic and transgenic manipulation. This analysis will identify the regulatory points that are potential targets for the introduction of C4 traits in C3 species.  Beyond producing a practical and profound understanding of C4 photosynthesis, the computational tools and systems resources developed by this project can be applied to other studies of plant development, biochemistry, physiology and productivity.The impact of this project will be broadened through the novel BrachyBio! Outreach Program (http://bti.cornell.edu/brachybio), which introduces high school students to authentic plant genetics research, while providing the plant research community with a web-accessible collection of indexed mutant stocks of Brachypodium distachyon (C3) and Setaria viridis (C4). Project outcomes will be available through a project-specific public website (C3-C4DB, http://c3c4.tc.cornell.edu), and curated into the Gramene public database (http://www.gramene.org).

561,"PI:  J. L. Bennetzen (University of Georgia)Plants containing engineered chromosome breakage constructs will be used as a study system to investigate the nature of inaccurate repair of double strand DNA breaks (DSB), and the genetic or environmental factors that affect the nature of inaccurate repair. DSB repair, in all organisms from bacteria to plants and animals, is highly accurate.  This accuracy is necessary to allow chromosomes to be replicated and passed on to subsequent generations of progeny because these breaks are so frequent and are lethal if unrepaired.  However, inaccurate repair of DSB does occur, leading to small deletions, insertions or other outcomes at the break site.  Some previous studies have suggested that the relative sizes and frequencies of the inaccurate DSB repair events may vary from species to species, and that this variance might be responsible for differences in the rate at which genomes change size and for differences in their rate of sequence change.  This project will use a regulated DSB system, involving the enzyme I-SceI expressed off a transgenic construct in plants that are then crossed to other plants that have a cutting site for I-SceI.  The progeny of this cross have been shown, in preliminary experiments, to undergo DSB at the I-SceI site, and to sometimes have inaccurate repair at that site.  The I-SceI site in many of these progeny plants will be DNA sequenced by the investigators to see what kind of deletions, insertions, et cetera, are found at the cleavage site.  This work is being done in four grass species (maize, pearl millet, rice, and sorghum), with very different genomic sizes and genomic stability, to see if this influences the nature or frequency of inaccurate DSB repair.  The I-SceI sites are also integrated at various different chromosomal locations in different plants, so one can investigate chromosome position effects on repair outcomes.  Finally, the investigators will determine the nature of inaccurate DSB repair at different times in development, under different environmental stresses (e.g., high UV light intensity or high ozone levels) and in genetic backgrounds that have known mutations in DNA repair processes or chromatin structure.  Taken together, these studies will provide insights into how plant genomes evolve, and particularly how DSB repair participates in this process, to generate the natural diversity on which natural selection acts. This research will provide a powerful approach, and numerous novel insights, for understanding how genomes change.  This will lead to a better understanding of how genetic diversity can be interpreted and influenced by biologists.  The many direct participants in the project, especially the postdoctoral fellow, graduate student and undergraduate students, will receive direct training in a multi-disciplinary approach to a core question in modern genetics:  how do genomes change, and what effect does that change have on current and future function of genes in that genome.  The description of the project and of the results will be available at a web site that will be created for this project, with a presentation style that makes the information digestible for all levels of interested parties, from K-12 students, to the general public, to active research scientists.  Raw data and the most advanced results will also be provided in public-accessible databases (e.g., GenBank for sequence information and peer-reviewed publications for detailed analysis), including the project web site.    Biological materials (seeds of transgenic plants, constructs for the I-SceI approach, etc.) will be available from the PI's lab until the time that some more permanent maintenance resource can be identified.   Understanding DNA variation, particularly the mechanisms and rates/outcomes, is vital for any mature understanding of genetics or genomes, and is shared by animal, human, plant, fungal, viral and microbial researchers, so it is expected that the training, outreach and data enrichment components of this project will benefit the broadest scientific community and general public.

562,"PI: Wayne Parrott (University of Georgia)CoPIs: Tom Clemente (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), Gary Stacey (University of Missouri-Columbia), and Carroll Vance and Robert Stupar (University of Minnesota-Twin Cities)Soybean is the world's largest single source of vegetable protein and edible oil and thus a key crop for meeting the nutritional needs of the increasing global population. Therefore, a thorough understanding of soybean genetics will be important for the development of new soybean varieties to meet the nutritional, environmental, and industrial requirements that soybean will fulfill over the coming decades. There are many research tools available that facilitate the genetic study of soybean. However, there has been one resource notably absent for soybean - reverse genetic tools. These tolls provide a way to identify and determine the function of soybean genes of academic, biological, or agricultural importance. Therefore, the long-term goal of this project is to build upon previous funding to develop and distribute the resources to needed to investigate the function of soybean genes, especially those involved in soybean quality and yield. The primary objective of the project is to provide novel mutant plants for soybean functional genomics research. This goal will be accomplished by building and cataloguing a collection of soybean insertional and gene activation mutants derived by engineering soybeans with a transposable element from rice which naturally moves around the genome and inserts itself into other genes. When the transposable element inserts itself into soybean genes, it prevents the gene from functioning which in turn can alter the appearance of the plant, or can be detected in the laboratory. Fast neutrons will also be used to derive additional mutations, as fast neutrons delete genes altogether, also changing the plant's appearance. The change in appearance that results from disrupting or deleting a gene is a direct indication of that gene's function.All of the genetic stocks developed by this work will be made available to the soybean research and breeding communities upon request. To aid in identifying and distributing mutant plants, interested researchers will attend workshops where they will search for mutants that are relevant to their research programs. Besides the basic research community, soybean breeders also will benefit directly, by gaining the ability to make informed decisions about which genes to select for in order to more easily develop higher-yielding, disease and stress resistant soybean varieties.  Genotype and phenotype information will be available via SoyBase (www.soybase.org), Soybean Knowledge Base (SoyKB; http://soykb.org), and/or the project website at http://soymutants.uga.edu.

Meanwhile, progress in understanding plant genomes and novel information technologies are transforming the pace, scale, and strategies used to conduct plant science research, allowing, for example, much richer appreciation for the connections among genes, environments, and plant form and function.  These advances in plant science promise to revolutionize crop breeding and help to keep pace with future population growth, environmental pressures, and energy needs.  In the past decade, the Gramene (www.gramene.org) database has served the research community as a portal to information about gene structure and function for multiple plant species.  Tools offered through the Gramene portal allow researchers to develop novel hypotheses on the bases of the most recent information and analyses, using a standardized framework. Yet, there are many remaining opportunities to more fully leverage functional information available from diverse plant species.  In this project, Gramene will substantially expand the number of plant genomes incorporated into the portal, add new capabilities for studying gene expression, pathways, and networks, and fundamentally improve the database architecture and user interfaces to facilitate sophisticated systems-level analyses. At least twenty reference genomes, annotated by the scientists who are studying them and including crop plant, model organism, and other species, will be incorporated into the expanded Gramene portal. Rice, maize, and Arabidopsis will be emphasized through the addition of publicly available data from expression, epigenomic, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A single internationally-coordinated resource for these data types will be maintained through collaboration with the Ensembl Plants project (plants.ensembl.org). To better capture information about the function of plant genes, Gramene will adopt two powerful tools: the Reactome (www.reactome.org) platform, which can be used to represent curated pathways and for performing pathways-based analyses; and the ATLAS (www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/) platform, which can be used to display and analyze expression profiles. These interfaces, along with Ensembl, BioMart, and a GWAS viewer, will form an integrated analysis system that is built on structured metadata and implemented through a high-capacity data warehouse and an advanced search engine.To engage and nurture early career scientists, the project will provide research training opportunities for postdoctoral associates and students at all levels. Training on the use of Gramene tools will be accomplished through presentations and workshops held at internationally attended conferences; broader audiences will be reached through a series of webinars.  Another major objective is to achieve broad interoperability among community resources. Standards development will be accomplished via outreach to collaborative data partners and scientists identified through several NSF-supported Research Coordination Networks (RCNs). Establishing common protocols, vocabularies, and semantics will have the powerful effect of bringing scientists together in research and educational fields, both domestically and abroad. A further objective is to engage biologists who are best qualified in their field to contribute to genome annotations on the basis of experimental evidence. Gramene will hold annual jamborees to train scientists in the use of standard curation tools that produce consistent definitions of data types and metadata. Finally, the ubiquitous publication of peer-reviewed journals online enables new opportunities to better link genome databases with the scientific literature. Gramene will collaborate with the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB), publisher of two high-impact journals, to prototype ways to couple collection of structured experimental data to the manuscript acceptance and publication process. As a whole, this project will contribute to long-term progress in merging information sciences with natural sciences that will ultimately lead to positive impacts on technology and society.

The goals of this collaborative effort are to provide a mutually beneficial research and commercialization platform where SBIR/STTR Phase II grantees can perform collaborative research with ERC faculty, researchers, and graduate students, to strengthen the capacity of their firms, and/or speed the transition of ERC advances to the marketplace. In accordance with the NSF solicitation NSF 10-617, AppliFlex LLC has submitted a request for additional funding. The sub-awardee identified in the supplemental request is Princeton University. This proposal/request meets the requirements of the solicitation NSF 10-023. This collaboration program offers an excellent opportunity to test AppliFlex's process in this unique mid-infrared wavelength by utilizing the capabilities and expertise of the Engineering Research Center on Mid-InfraRed Technologies for Health and the Environment (MIRTHE). Both AppliFlex and MIRTHE share the same platform, mid-infrared light; AppliFlex focuses on mid-infrared laser materials processing and MIRTHE focuses on mid-infrared laser diagnostics. Therefore, the company and MIRTHE complement each other perfectly and together, they can synergistically maximize transformational mid-infrared technologies. AppliFlex LLC is a Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II company. Vanderbilt University (Vanderbilt) is working with AppliFlex on the STTR grant. AppliFlex is proposing to work with the National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) Institute for Mid-Infrared Technologies for Health and Environment (MIRTHE). MIRTHE is an active ERC headquartered at Princeton University, (Princeton) with partners including the City College New York, Johns Hopkins University, Rice, Texas A&M, and the University of Maryland Baltimore County. AppliFlex is proposing to work with MIRTHE to develop a laser vapor deposition (LVD) for depositing thin films and heterostructures of polymer and functionalized nanoparticles. LVD utilizes mid-infrared laser to convert organic materials to a gaseous plume for deposition on surfaces with minimal photo-fragmentation. This collaboration between the small business and the universities will speed up market entry and aid expansion into adjacent markets for mid-infrared laser processing of materials. The research partners have complimentary skill sets with the small business having expertise in resonant excitation of organic and polymer materials with mid-infrared laser light, while the core mission of MIRTHE is the resonant absorption and sensing of materials with mid-infrared light. The innovation starts with the modeling and using matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE). The ERC and the small business and its STTR partner will be developing technologies that will potentially help the nation in detection of compounds important to health and security. Additional applications are also envisioned that will improve lives.

565,"AbstractTechnical ImpactThe combination of two metals to make a bimetallic catalyst frequently leads to a more catalytically active material than either constituent metal. Besides higher activities, bimetallic catalysts can have improved selectivities and greater deactivation resistance. The catalytic chemistry that explains how bimetallic enhancement arises is not well explained. Depending on the chemical reaction, the enhancement can be attributed to a geometric effect, an electronic effect, or a mixed metal site effect. The difficulties in determining the source of catalytic enhancement are numerous: enhancement could be due to a combination of these effects; the bimetallic nanostructure is not well-controlled at the synthesis level; there may be a metal-support interaction; or the studied bimetallic nanostructure can reconfigure during the chemical reaction.So, how to develop a greater understanding of bimetallic catalysts so that they may be exploited appropriately is a significant question. Professor Michael Wong at William Marsh Rice University in Houston has an approach to developing more of this understanding. Wong intends to focus on a model of a bimetallic catalyst in which metallic nanoparticles of one metal are the support for the second active metal. The interaction is built-in and controllable, and amenable to the analysis of the bimetallic nanostructure using spectroscopic methods near reaction conditions; and culminating in the quantification of their catalytic properties under reaction conditions that do not modify the nanostructure. The model system is based on previous studies using palladium metal supported on gold nanoparticles, and the model test reaction is the catalysis in the water phase of trichloroethene hydrodechlorination. Continued innovations in catalysis technology rely on the development of novel materials and the rigorous elucidation of reactivity dependence on catalyst nanostructure.PdAu bimetallic catalysis has shown some promise as a new technology for water-phase hydrodechlorination. This technology is important for pollution control in groundwater, a source for >50% of US drinking water.Broader ImpactThis proposal describes a three-year research and teaching plan consisting of multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in materials chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, chemical engineering fundamentals, and colloid science. Three new educational and community outreach activities are proposed: a yearly NanoDays demonstration at the Children's Museum of Houston, a local-area high school teachers development program in coordination with the NSF-sponsored RET program at Rice, and a lab module design project incorporated into the graduate-level kinetics/reactor engineering course.

566,"METABOLOMICS: Identification of Inducible Bioactive Plant Metabolites Japan:  Yutaka Okumoto, Naoki Mori, and Naoko Yoshinaga (Kyoto University) USA:  Georg Jander (Boyce Thompson Institute); Eric Schmelz and Alisa Huffaker (USDA-ARS)Intellectual Merit:  Plants produce an enormous variety of toxic and deterrent metabolites to protect themselves against pathogens and herbivores. These chemical defenses include well-studied molecules like caffeine in coffee and capsaicin in hot peppers. However, less than 10% of the metabolites in any given plant species have been identified. Many defense-related compounds are absent in non-stressed plants, but accumulate locally to very high levels following attack. The targeted identification of these small molecules, which accumulate in response to infection or herbivory, will result in the discovery previously unknown plant defenses. In the current project, defense-induced metabolites will be identified in four well-studied plant species, maize, soybean, rice and Arabidopsis. By focusing on these key species, it will be possible to make use of well-developed genetic tools and an extensive body of prior research to speed the discovery genes and pathways that are required for the synthesis of previously unknown plant metabolites. The defensive functions of the newly identified plant genes and metabolites will be confirmed with insect and pathogen bioassays.Broader Impacts: Analysis of induced defenses in plants will lead to the identification of previously unknown molecules that have practical applications in the control of pests and diseases. A mechanistic understanding of natural plant defenses will enable targeted trait improvements that reduce energy inputs and the use of agricultural chemicals, which are required when cultivating plants for food, animal feed, and biofuel production. Interactions between American and Japanese scientists will be enhanced through this highly collaborative research project.

567,"The field of supercomputing is experiencing a rapid change in system structure, programming models, and software environments in response to advances in application requirements and in underlying enabling technologies. Traditional parallel programming approaches have relied on static resource allocation and task scheduling through programming interfaces such as MPI and OpenMP. These methods are reaching their efficiency and scalability limits on the new emerging classes of systems, spurring the creation of innovative dynamic strategies and software tools, including advanced runtime system software and programming interfaces that use them. To accelerate adoption of these next-generation methods, a unique environment is being created and operated that provides a comprehensive ensemble of state-of-the-art runtime system software and programming interfaces. Taken from previous research and development projects, some at the host institution, Indiana University, and others from premiere research organizations across the nation, these execution systems are integrated in a single supported Reconfigurable Execution Framework Testbed (REFT) and made available to parallel application algorithm developers as well as researchers in advanced tools for parallel computing. The basic REFT hardware capabilities include a medium- scale heterogeneous Linux cluster with multi-core sockets, high-bandwidth interconnect, and mass storage; field-programmable gate arrays; and instrumentation for power measurement. ParalleX-based HPX-3, ETI SWARM, Berkeley GasNet, Rice University?s Habanero, Illinois? Charm++, Cray Chapel, IBM X-10, and UPC among other programming and execution models comprise the major components of this unique facility.Supercomputing is making a sharp corner turn in form, function, and methodologies.  Unfortunately, few in the field are skilled in the use of the emerging execution and programming models that are becoming increasingly critical to effectively utilizing supercomputers to deliver quality science for extreme-scale applications?either those at the highest end of the performance spectrum (Petaflops currently and Exaflops at the end of the decade) or strong-scaled fixed-size problems. REFT serves the NSF computational science community by dramatically lowering the barrier to training, experimentation, and adoption of new dynamic execution methods and systems. It provides full documentation, on-line tutorials, in-house classes, and workshops for skill development and community building for the broad US HPC community to accelerate application, evaluation, and exploitation. As a repository for competing and complementary software environments it provides a single site for conducting comparative studies by end-users to establish best practices. As an NSF resource, it serves to expedite and further goals of computational science by enabling effective application of the next generation Petaflops-class computer systems of millions of cores and eventual Exascale systems with billion-way concurrency.

568,"In the project entitled  Quantum Engineering with Dissipation,  we create and study strongly interacting quantum degenerate atomic gases, with a focus on systems in which correlations are induced by strong inelastic, or dissipative, interactions. Dissipation is emerging as a new tool for quantum engineering for creating novel states of fundamental interest. We use dissipation to create spatial correlations in strontium condensates in three-dimensional optical lattices and study the dissipative analog of the superfluid-to-Mott-insulator transition. An optical Feshbach resonance is used to create two-body inelastic interactions, and the effects of three-body inelastic interactions can be explored with Sr-86, which naturally has a large three-body decay rate. There are many interesting properties to study in these systems, such as the criteria for creation of particle correlations, excitation spectra, and adiabaticity timescales for changing lattice and interaction parameters. In addition, in a bulk system we will look at the response of a Bose condensate to a rapid quench of the interaction strength from the weakly interacting to the strongly interacting regime, which can be produced with an optical Feshbach resonance. Of interest to experiments in a bulk system and lattice is the timescale for development of spatial correlations in the many-body state.When large numbers of particles come together and interact, new phenomena can emerge that are unexpected from the basic form of the interaction between pairs of particles. Superconductivity is a famous example of this.  Understanding strongly interacting, many-body systems is a grand challenge for many areas of physics because of the promise of new material properties of technological significance and also because the systems can be very complicated and they stretch our understanding of the natural world.  In the last decade, there have been great advances in the creation and study of ultracold clouds of gaseous atoms, which are cooled by lasers to temperatures around a millionth of a degree above absolute zero. Ultracold atoms made in this way have the amazing property that their interactions can be arbitrarily controlled, which opens the possibility of using them to make designer materials or test models of interacting, many-body systems. With the support of this National Science Foundation grant,  Prof. Killian's research group at Rice University in Houston, Texas will develop new techniques for manipulating atom-atom interactions using lasers and search for new emergent phenomena.This work will involve at least two graduate students and one undergraduate student, and it will train them for high-technology careers in optics or materials. This work will also involve undergraduate researchers in summer research and work during the academic terms leading to honors research theses.

569,"The field of ultracold atomic physics has been progressing rapidly without signs of slowing down. Under this award, we will carry out a theoretical study of several important problems concerning the superfluid properties of cold atoms. These projects are of fundamental importance, and in the meantime are inspired by recent experimental progress in the field. We will consider the properties of cold atomic ensembles whose effective spatial dimensions in which they live are tuned. A tunable spatial dimension is not readily achievable in other materials. But for cold atoms, by adjusting the geometry of the trapping potential that is used to confine them, such a feat can be realized in the lab. We will also consider the novel properties of cold atoms under the manipulation of appropriately arranged laser fields. Under proper conditions, the laser beams can induce synthetic electromagnetic fields such that the neutral atoms behave like charged particles moving in electric and/or magnetic fields. These research projects are of great relevance to current experiments, some of which are being carried out by PI's colleagues at Rice University. These problems span a quite wide spectrum within the field of cold atoms with close ties to condensed matter physics and nonlinear physics. Students involved in these projects will receive a solid training in theoretical physics, including both analytical methods and numerical techniques. Such a training will be very valuable for their future career in science and engineering. analytical method; Award; career; Charge; Dimensions; Electromagnetic Fields; Engineering; Future; Lasers; Life; magnetic field; novel; particle; Physics; Property; Research Project Grants; research study; Rice; Science; Solid; Students; Techniques; Theoretical Studies; Training; UniversitiesSUPERFLUID ATOMIC BOSONS, FERMIONS AND THEIR MIXTURES",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
570,"Objective:The objective of this program is innovative research in new transformative algorithms for high-precision localization services using low-cost WiFi technology. Features of the Physical Layer RF signal will be exploited to create transformative localization algorithms which are vital for next generation indoor navigation, network security, emergency evacuation and commercial services. The program connects researchers from Rice University (RU), University College Dublin (UCD) and Queen?s University Belfast (QUB) with expertise in localization algorithms (UCD), baseband/FPGA processing architectures (QUB/RU), WiFi Physical Layer networking (RU/QUB) and localization applications (UCD/QUB); the UCD and QUB work is funded by their national funding agencies.Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is the creation of the Spotlight and Location-Sync algorithms to achieve sub-meter accuracy in real-world indoor environments.

571,"Abstract#1232724 Ke, Pu-ChunThe scientific community has recently determined that the physical and physicochemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) deemed so desirable in terms of application are often the direct causes for their complex behavior in the environment. Upon entering the environment through air, water and soil, and during the lifecycle of manufacturing, transport, use and disposal, NPs  at large  undergo constant transformations from their interactions with light, natural organic matter (NOM), microorganisms, and plants. The goal of this proposal is therefore to elucidate the mutable behavior and fate of discharged NPs by extrapolating the established concept of protein  corona , i.e., surface modification of NPs by plasma proteins in the bloodstream, to  biocorona  in the environment. The notion of biocorona encompasses NOM, proteins and carbohydrates that are ubiquitous building blocks of nature. This proposed treatment is validated in that a) biological systems are an essential and integral part of ecosystems, and b) it is the transformed rather than the pristine material, that must be evaluated for potential environmental impact. Intellectual Merit: Technically, the introduction of biocorona exploits the established experimental, theoretical and computational approaches developed for the research areas of protein adsorption and folding while integrating the elements pertaining to nanotechnology and environmental systems. The three specific aims of this proposal are to elucidate a) NP-biocoronas in the natural aqueous environment, b) NP-biocoronas in plants, and c) biotransformation and degradation of NP-biocoronas by aquatic organisms. The parameter space to be mapped includes solvent hardness and pH, NP size and solubility, protein conformation and binding thermodynamics, plant cell translocation, transport and phytotoxicity, ROS production, and photosynthesis. Results from these studies will offer essential information on the stability and transformation of NPs in the natural aqueous environment, facilitate our understanding of the uptake, biodistribution and toxicity of NPs in plant species, and provide key indicators for evaluating aquatic response to NP exposure.  Broader Impacts: Recent literature on the environmental health and safety of nanotechnology (NanoEHS) has expanded exponentially. Much NanoEHS study is now converging from phenomenological observation and mass testing toward amassing a knowledge base of increasing efficiency and prediction power. To keep pace with the vast variety and growing application of nanomaterials and to accommodate the vast complexity of the environment, methodical approaches such as extrapolated concept of biocorona are logical and cost-effective solutions to environmental risk assessment of nanotechnology. In addition to promoting interdisciplinary research and education at Clemson and Wake Forest University in the Carolinas, funding of this proposal will catalyze fusion of the protein folding community with the community of NanoEHS for cutting-edge innovation with potential economical gains. Furthermore, this proposed frontier research will necessarily foster exchanges between the PIs' labs and their collaborators at Delaware State, Denison, Duke, and Rice Universities, and the National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics in Estonia. abstracting; Adsorption; Air; aquatic organism; aqueous; Area; Behavior; Binding Proteins; Biodistribution; biological systems; Biophysics; Blood Circulation; Carbohydrates; Cells; Chemicals; Chimeric Proteins; Communities; Complex; cost effective; Delaware; Ecosystem; Education; Elements; Environment; Environmental Health; Environmental Impact; Environmental Risk Factor; Estonia; forest; Fostering; frontier; Funding; Goals; Hardness; innovation; Institutes; Interdisciplinary Study; knowledge base; Light; Literature; Maps; Metabolic Biotransformation; microorganism; Modification; nanomaterials; nanoparticle; Nanotechnology; Nature; Photosynthesis; Physics; Plants; Plasma Proteins; Production; Property; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; protein folding; Proteins; Research; response; Rice; Risk Assessment; Safety; Soil; Solubility; Solutions; Solvents; Surface; System; Testing; Thermodynamics; Toxic effect; Universities; uptake; WaterEXTRAPOLATING THE CONCEPT OF PROTEIN CORONA FOR UNDERSTANDING NANOPARTICLES AT LARGE",0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06
572,"The ability to detect and respond to stress is central to a plant's survival in a host of unfavorable environments and a key determinant of agricultural productivity under sub-optimal field conditions. Although a number of pathways have been described that confer specific protection to various abiotic and biotic challenges, a recent discovery of a potentially universal protective mechanism involving the Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier (SUMO) may transform the current appreciation of stress biology. Specifically, it has been shown that the Arabidopsis SUMO polypeptide becomes covalently attached to numerous nuclear proteins and that the levels of these conjugates rise rapidly and reversibly after exposing plants to various abiotic stresses. Using novel quantitative proteomic approaches, it has been discovered that many of the SUMOylation targets are known critical regulators with their collective functions implying that SUMO addition engages a protective response that broadly alters chromatin accessibility, transcription, and mRNA processing/export.  Taken together, these results suggest that SUMO might offer unique opportunities to globally manipulate the stress response for agricultural benefit. Unfortunately, the organization and functions of the SUMO system are largely unknown in other plant species, including all important agricultural crops, thus precluding rational redesign to improve crop plant productivity. Moreover, preliminary genome analyses of maize and rice revealed that the organization of the SUMO system in cereals might differ significantly from that in observed in Arabidopsis. This EAGER project proposes to define how SUMOylation works during stress in crops using maize (Zea mays) as the model. The specific aims are to: (i) delineate the SUMOylation system in maize using bioinformatic and biochemical methods and define kinetically how the system responds to stress; (ii) generate a library of maize mutants and transgenic lines affecting key components required for SUMO addition and release; (iii) define the  SUMOylome  of maize, quantify how the SUMOylation status of individual targets changes during stress and after recovery; and (iv) analyze SUMO pathway mutants phenotypically to determine how stress-induced SUMOylation may help maize survive adverse environments. Collectively, this project will generate much-needed tools and germplasm that can be exploited to understand how SUMO might reorganize maize chromatin and its transcriptome during stress, and identify key points in plant stress responses involving SUMOylation that can be manipulated for improved yield.The current understanding of SUMOylation in plants is still rudimentary and almost nonexistent in crop species where its manipulation may have substantial agricultural impact. This project will provide interdisciplinary training of the next generation of plant scientists working on crops. This research will collectively incorporate postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates as well as high school students sponsored by the Wisconsin Youth Apprenticeship Program (YAP) in Biotechnology.  During the course of this project, reagents, techniques, mutants, and transgenic lines will be generated that will provide a much needed foundation to investigate SUMOylation in maize, and hopefully offer new strategies to rationally alter the SUMO system for agricultural and medicinal benefit.  Plant resources will be available through the Maize Genetics Cooperative Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu).

573,"ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1206899               PI:  Hartgerink, Jeffrey          ORG:  Rice UniversityTitle:  Designed Collagen Heterotrimeric Helices and Nanofibrous HydrogelsINTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and arguably one of the most important proteins in nature, playing a critical role in nearly every tissue especially bone, skin, and tendons.  Furthermore, collagen plays a major role in many diseases such as metathesis in cancer and a variety of brittle bone diseases.  Despite collagen's critical importance, its structure and the assembly process that leads to its final fibrous form is poorly understood.  In the work funded through this grant, the Hartgerink lab at Rice University will focus on understanding this critical molecule through an iterative process of synthesis, analysis, and computational modeling.  Molecules, which closely mimic collagen's structure, will be prepared and their structure determined through a variety of analytical methods including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and transmission electron microscopy.  Based on these findings, a model will be prepared to predict new and more complicated collagen structures.  This process will allow a blueprint to be created that will define how natural collagen assembles as well as how one can chemically synthesize and self-assemble structurally sophisticated mimics of collagen.  BROADER IMPACTS:  It is expected that this blueprint will enhance the knowledge of this centrally important biological molecule as well as create a useful tool for biomaterials researchers.  The research described in this grant proposal will also be used as the basis for undergraduate and graduate educational programs that effectively combine chemical design and synthesis with traditional structural biology into an exciting multidisciplinary study.  Furthermore, through a secondary education outreach program, high school science teachers will have an opportunity to participate in a research lab over summers to develop innovative curriculum modules based on current research that can be directly implemented in high school level chemistry and biology courses. analytical method; Applications Grants; base; Biocompatible Materials; Biological; Biology; bone; Chemicals; Chemistry; Collagen; Computer Simulation; design; Disease; Education and Outreach; Educational Curriculum; Funding; Grant; high school; Human body; Hydrogels; innovation; Knowledge; Malignant Neoplasms; Modeling; multidisciplinary; nanofiber; Nature; NMR Spectroscopy; Osteogenesis Imperfecta; outreach program; Play; Process; programs; Proteins; Research; Research Personnel; Rice; Role; Science; Skin; structural biology; Structure; teacher; Tendon structure; Tissues; tool; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Universities; WorkDESIGNED COLLAGEN HETEROTRIMERIC HELICES AND NANOFIBROUS HYDROGELS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1.4762016747667557e-05,1e-06
574,"Collaborative Research: The provenance of the excess sulfur released in arc volcanoes during Plinian eruptionsIntellectual merit. Although it is commonly accepted that the behavior of volatile elements in magmas controls eruption dynamics, the depth and amount of vapor exsolved, as well as the distribution and transport of vapor bubbles in shallow magmatic systems remain poorly constrained. This project aims to develop a novel multidisciplinary methodology to quantify where and how much vapor degassing occurs, how fast vapor bubbles are transported in different magmatic environments, if they are expected to accumulate in the shallower portion of the system and how much effect this accumulation will have on eruption dynamics. A fundamental observation to be explained is the discrepancy between emitted volatiles released during explosive eruptions and the amount of volatiles that can be dissolved in the melt prior to eruption (excess degassing). The clearest example of excess degassing is associated with S mass balance, because S release during and after eruptions can be measured accurately by spectroscopic methods. Several open questions will be addressed: (1) How much vapor can be present in a magma prior to an eruption and what fraction was exsolved in-situ versus transported from deeper unerupted magma (ex-situ)? (2) If ex-situ degassing is important, what controls the accumulation of bubbles in the shallowest part of the magma body and how does it affect the eruptive behavior of the magma? The proposed work is transformative in that it will explore the poorly understood transport and storage of exsolved volatiles in magmatic systems with new numerical models developed by the PIs, and it will integrate geochemical data (trace elements in apatites and pyrrhotite) with thermodynamic modeling (expected vapor content as function of crystallinity) and fluid dynamics modeling into a novel approach to quantify the volatile budget in magmas. Existing thermodynamic models will be used that include H2O (e.g., MELTS) and H2O-CO2 (e.g., VolatileCalc) solubilities to determine, for a range of reasonable initial conditions, the percentage of exsolved vapor in given examples of Plinian eruptions with documented S excess (Mount St. Helens 1980, El Chichon 1982, Pinatubo 1991, Krakatau 1883, Katmai 1912, Taupo 181 AD) as well as for larger, older S-rich units (Kos Plateau Tuff 160 ky, and Fish Canyon Tuff 28 Ma) for which the S atmospheric load is poorly-constrained. In the same units, published data and/or analyses of apatites and pyrrhotites by electron microprobe will be used to determine (a) whether the magmas were vapor-saturated in their shallow reservoirs prior to eruption (using a geochemical test we have developed) and (b) using zoning profiles in apatites, how volatile element contents vary prior to eruption. Finally, multi-phase flow models will be developed using different numerical techniques to estimate how mobile vapor bubbles are across the magmatic system and how quickly they accumulate in reservoirs before an eruption. Such models will provide invaluable new insights in the dynamics of volcanic eruptions. Broader impacts. This project will support a graduate student, and will train her/him in a highly multi- disciplinary and inherently quantitative environment, enabling him/her with those fundamental skills of modern science. It will provide a new investigator (Huber, no prior funding) funds to develop an active group in physical volcanology and will also allow two young faculty members to continue an active multi-disciplinary collaboration that has been successful over the last few years. Finally, the PIs propose to develop a short course for advanced undergraduate and graduate students on merging modeling techniques and geochemical analyses applied to magmatic processes. PI Huber has been teaching a version on this course, over the last two years, as a week-long series of lectures and practical exercises at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Geneva (Switzerland), and at Rice University. On the basis of the enthusiastic response of the students to this class, we expect that organizing such a course at Georgia Tech and University of Washington is likely to attract many local students, and would strongly help our community to become more aware and proficient in quantitative methods in Earth Sciences.

575,"Understanding the forces controlling basaltic explosive eruptions is of fundamental importance in order to improve understanding of the range of behaviors of our most frequently active volcanoes and to assess hazards of future explosive events. The summit of Kîlauea is the site of large and growing volcano-tourism (e.g., 5000 visitors/day at the overlook at Jaggar Museum), and there is a public need both for better knowledge of the volcanoes' behavior and improved forecasting of the likely course of future eruptions.  Although not its usual style, explosive eruptions have punctuated Kîlauea's history, with five moderately large events since 1500 CE. The study quantifies and models the dominant factors that determine explosive eruptive behavior at Kilauea volcano, through a study of the eruptive products from three plume-forming and fountaining eruptions. The events are episode 1 of the highest historical fountaining eruption at Kîlauea, the 1959 Kîlauea Iki eruption, a much earlier powerful fountaining eruption in 1480 CE and a powerful; plume-forming eruption in 1635 CE.The novelty of the approach lies in using new 'rate-meters' to estimate likely durations of magma ascent beneath the volcano to arrive at the influence of this residence time on the ultimate 'fate' of the magma. The investigators will study microtextures (vesicles and microlites), volatiles in melt inclusions, and embayments in eruptive products.In addition to direct support for 3 graduate students and undergraduate students, results will contribute to educational outreach efforts anchored on development of volcanology classes at University of Hawaii, Columbia University and Rice University. The proposal involves exchange of material and ideas between five institutions to the benefit of young researchers, and undergraduate and graduate classes. Our results will be widely disseminated via the Internet using linked web sites hosted by Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and NSF-funded institutions.

576,"The research will conduct numerical simulations of fold and thrust belts using the discrete element method in order to develop a refined understanding of the controls and mechanisms responsible for their structural geometries and evolution under a range of conditions. Forward modeling of this sort is an important tool for testing and refining interpretations of fold and thrust belts observed in the field, which often have limited exposure, are highly eroded, and are preserved under conditions far from those in which they were formed. Specific questions to be addressed include: (1) What physical and mechanical parameters control fault vergence in fold and thrust belts, with particular attention to the origin and evolution of the most frontal structures which are common traps for hyrocarbons? (2) What is the role of decollement and basement heterogeneity in the mechanical state and structural evolution of fold and thrust belts? And (3) What are the structural consequences of specific basement configurations and stratigraphy on fold and thrust belts? The simulations will be carried out using RICEBAL, a code developed at Rice University; 2D and 3D simulations will be carried out to examine the effects of mechanical stratigraphy, heterogeneous decollement properties and structure, and indentation. Results will be compared with natural examples, in particular, the classic Canadian cordillera and the northern Appalachians in Canada.Fold and thrust belt development represents a fundamental mountain building process and is also responsible for the formation of rich oil and gas reservoirs. Understanding the conditions responsible for distinctive frontal structures that favor hydrocarbon accumulations allow first-order predictions of locations of future prospects. The simulations carried out in this project will provide a unique, and yet safe, way to explore the associated geodynamic processes, with broad applications to many other problems. In addition, this project will enable further refinement of the discrete element method code RICEBAL, developed at Rice University, which will be made available for broader distribution for education and research through the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics.

577,"To succeed as pathogens, fungi must adapt their metabolism to nutrient availability within the host, but little is known about the genetic regulatory mechanisms involved. The filamentous ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice blast disease, which annually results in a 10 to 30 percent reduction in global rice yield. Traditional plant breeding strategies have failed to contain this severe threat to global food security; however, because of the amenability of M. oryzae to molecular analysis, durable control strategies might emerge from a better understanding of the molecular and cellular processes underlying the plant-fungal interaction. The goal of this project is to use mutants of M. oryzae, impaired in their ability to develop in rice, to unlock the fundamental cellular, biochemical, and genetic regulatory mechanisms that govern the rice-fungus interaction. Using molecular genetics and biochemical techniques, it is expected that this project will reveal essential new knowledge about the integration of metabolism with gene expression in M. oryzae that will likely shed light on important genetic control pathways in other pathogenic fungi. The investigators will promote the pathogenic gene discovery process as a tool to train students and inspire underrepresented minorities to pursue a career in science. Central to our research ethos will be the integration of undergraduate, graduate, and underrepresented high school students and teachers, representing diverse sections of the community, into the process of pathogenic gene identification and characterization. The M. oryzae- rice interaction will be used to inform undergraduate students of the importance of fundamental concepts in genetics and biochemistry, to allow graduate students and postdoctoral research associates to develop as mentors and teachers, and to involve high school students in real-world problems that, through their participation in EPSCoR summer camps supervised by the PI, will inspire them to undertake a career in science.

578,"This project lies in the area of geometric calculus of variations, which treats the formation and behavior of singularities for various optimal or stationary functions, fields, measures, or geometric structures, possibly subject to constraints, both deterministic and stochastic. The first specific class of projects involves continuing work with Thierry De Pauw (Paris VI) concerning the study of chains, cochains, charges, and the higher dimensional calculus of variations in general metric spaces with general coefficient groups. We consider a variety of mass-type functionals and the notion of a flat chain which generalizes the finite mass metric-space currents of Ambrosio-Kirchheim and the rectifiable and flat Euclidean-space G-chains of B.White and Fleming, Homology theories defined with such chains give an interplay between the topology and geometry of a metric spaces. For example, preliminary work as shown how Lipschitz path connectedness or the existence of finite mass spanning surfaces may be characterized by a suitable 0 and 1 dimensional flat homology groups. Variational cohomology may be treated by charges, which are cochains dual to normal currents, suitably topologized, and which often admit representation by pairs of continuous forms. Second we are continuing work with T. Riviere (ETH), on relations between various energies of maps between Riemannian manifolds and the homotopy classes of the maps. Following our recent work, we will consider energies given by integrating powers of the norm of the differential, the Hessian, etc. A key general question for critical dimensions is the minimum energy required to produce maps with a given nontrivial topology, in particular, how this minimum grows asymptotically as the topology degenerates. There are interesting concrete problems here for the rational homotopy of 4 manifolds. Third,with Betul Orcan (Rice) we propose to initiate work on geometric structures arising in geometric measure theory from stochastic variational problems with noisy data or noisy dependence on data. The work should be based on quantitative low regularity results and quantitatively described probable higher regularity for most data.Solutions to many variational problems in both pure and applied mathematics often are forced to have singularities, that is, to involve regions where large oscillations occur. For example among the many classes of liquid crystals, the optical axis may be forced to oscillate rapidly near points or along curves or along walls between regions. Our research proposes to understand the relationship between energies in such variational problems and the topological barriers imposed by the physics of the problems. Geometric constraints which occur naturally in many physical problems have led to new mathematical issues, and we need to use the full language of geometric measure theory to have sufficiently general geometric structures and objects to treat these issues. Also in applications, the presence of impurities in materials or of noise in measurements and data acquisition is important to consider. So it would be quite useful to develop mathematical tools to incorporate noise and stochastic considerations with the geometric structures. Two particular problems that we propose studying involve flow problems in image processing and the growth of higher dimensional ramified structures in biology with noisy data.

579,"Under the direction of Dr. Prudence Rice, Mr. Nathan Meissner will analyze small chipped-stone projectile points manufactured by Postclassic Mayan peoples to gain insight into their economic and trade practices. This regional study will examine similarities and differences in the manufacturing technology of projectile (arrow) points from multiple sites throughout the Maya lowlands, including Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico. The selection of sites will also allow comparisons among various cultural sub-groupings of Mayan-speaking peoples. Data generated from this seven-month study will be used to address two general anthropological questions that are yet to be fully answered in Mesoamerica: (1) How does large-scale trading and heightened social interaction impact technological systems at traditional levels of social organization? (2) To what degree might cultural boundaries impact aspects of tool production during periods of intensified social interaction?  Point technologies in the form of arrow tips provide an excellent source of data to address these questions, as raw material procurement strategies, the design process, and the use life of artifacts encode important information about past behaviors.This study will generate new data on small points produced by Maya through a combination of macroscopic technological analysis, X-Ray Florescence (XRF), site-based spatial analysis, and protein residue analysis using cross-over immuno-electrophoresis (CIEP).  Macroscopic analysis will be the basis for creating a taxonomic classification of technological styles. XRF will be used to chemically source the origins of obsidian traded into the Maya lowlands from volcanic regions in highland Guatemala and Mexico, and reconstruct trade patterns. Spatial analysis and protein residue identification will provide important clues concerning contexts of bow-and-arrow use that relate to hunting, warfare, and ritual activities.  A technological systems framework will be used to interpret variability of these data at a local level and a regional level, and will contribute to an anthropological understanding of past economies and the political geography of the Postclassic lowland Maya.The project will provide graduate student training. It will also help to create partnerships between academic and governmental institutions in Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico. This study will also create the first taxonomic classification of its kind, providing future researchers a system for more refined site-to-site comparisons of small point technology.  The results of this study will be disseminated in various forms including a dissertation, papers presented at academic conferences, and peer-reviewed journal articles in both English and Spanish.  All data resulting from the project will be shared online in the form of an interactive website, and will also be uploaded to the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR) for electronic sharing.

580,"Intellectual Merit: Photosynthesis, which harvests solar energy and assimilates atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), represents the  engine  of life. Constraints on photosynthesis and plant growth can occur in most land plants where access to CO2 becomes limiting under environmental stress (drought, high temperature, saline soils).  Some plants evolved a metabolic pump (called C4) which actively accumulates CO2, conferring an advantage, especially under extreme environments. Prior to the 2001 discovery of species which perform C4 in individual photosynthetic cells, the paradigm for C4 plants was a requirement for cooperative function of two cell types.  In contrast, the single-cell C4 species, which have a unique form of carbon acquisition, contain photosynthetic cells with two types of chloroplasts in separate compartments, one supporting the capture of atmospheric CO2, the other functioning in its assimilation into organic matter. Problems to be investigated in this project are identification and characterization of genes and proteins required for the development and function of single-cell C4 photosynthesis.  This involves identification of differences in protein composition of the two types of chloroplasts, the nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes responsible for their synthesis, and the genetic control of chloroplast differentiation. The approach will include use of molecular and microscopic techniques to analyze and identify the products of gene expression leading to development of this form of C4.  This project is expected to gain insights into an exceptional mechanism of photosynthesis, and into regulation of biochemical differentiation in cell biology. The research project will also involve an international collaboration with Dr. S. Offermann of Hannover University in Germany, which is sponsored by the International Office of Science and Engineering. This collaboration will provide an international learning experience for the graduate students and will extend the expertise of the US lab. Broader Impacts: The research is expected to contribute new insights that will impact education, future research on photosynthesis, and mechanisms of adaptations in plants.  There are potential applications for solving growing global limitations on bio-resources.  The single-cell mechanism is an attractive model for developing crops, e.g. rice, with improved productivity, especially under environmental stress.

581,"CCF - 0746850 PI name: KArtik MohanramTitle: CAREER: Design Optimization for Robustness to Single-Event EffectsInstitution: William Marsh Rice UniversityABSTRACT:Technology trends and economic factors are driving forces behind the widespread move to mainstream computing and communication systems based entirely on commodity hardware and operating systems. Yet, the premium that we as a society place on the reliability of such systems has increased commensurate with our reliance on them for the smooth operation of our lives. Soft errors resulting from single-event effects (SEEs) are an important-and possibly dominant-failure mode that impact the reliability of such mainstream commodity systems.This research will develop low-cost SEE-reliability-aware and SEE-reliability-driven design solutions based on optimization to maximize robustness to SEEs, commonly termed SEE-hardening. SEE-hardening is an attractive low-cost solution to increase reliability since it does not require any runtime support from either the hardware or the operating system. SEE-hardening can also be used to complement and reduce the overhead cost of traditional fault detection and tolerance techniques. The optimization algorithms for SEE-hardening resulting from this work provide seamless tradeoffs between SEE-hardness and area-delay-power, enabling cost-effective solutions commensurate with the criticality and reliability requirements over the lifetime of the target application. A major impact of this research is to enable ubiquitous low-cost highly reliable computing, by expanding its reach to domains that lack the financial resources to acquire custom solutions. Through academic and industry collaborations, this project will develop an integrated testbed and web-based resources to facilitate broad research in reliable system design, an area that is rapidly gaining in importance and interest.

582,"Under the direction of Dr. Prudence Rice, Ms. Cristina Rospigliosi will conduct archaeological research at the Middle/Late Sicán site of Luya (A.D. 900-1350/1375), located in the Lambayeque Valley on the northern north coast of Perú. Luya is composed of public architecture, featuring twelve adobe mounds built around an open space. The site has been described as an important public center and satellite both of the regional capital of Vista Florida, and of the Sicán Site, the capital of the Sicán state. Luya is important because it will contribute insight into an important but previously unexplored topic on the north coast: the functional roles and relations between capital cities and second-tier sites in early states, especially the role of ideology.Although dealing with a past time period the research has direct relevance today because it provides insight into the mechanisms which underlie the regional organization of traditional societies and the role which ideology may play in integrating them into functioning units. Such information would be relevant to understanding processes which are currently being played out in multiple parts of the world. An archaeological approach has the ability of tracing such processes on century and millennial time scales.The Middle Sicán polity has been characterized as a centralized religious state exerting ideological control over six contiguous valleys in the Lambayeque region. But no archaeological research has been carried out to examine the function, role, and relations of second-tier sites in this state, outside the site core. Moreover, early ethnohistorical records depict regional polities as independent from each other, rather than integrated under a central government. And although the role of ideology in ancient polities is an important topic in Andean archaeology, it has not been commonly studied by analyzing data from monumental architecture.To understand socio-political relations in the Sicán polity beyond its core area, this research has three goals: (1) to determine the socio-political function of Luya; (2) to determine if elements of the Sicán ideology assumed to be shared throughout the polity can be identified at Luya; and (3) to record spatial, material cultural, and political changes between the Middle and Late Sicán periods at a hinterland site. Six months of fieldwork at Luya will include excavations at three mounds, test pits off the mounds, and mapping of revealed architecture. Architectural analyses will include spatial organization, activity contexts, and building techniques (e.g., construction chambers, adobe builders' marks), which will be compared to published data from the Sicán Site.Broader impacts, beyond the dissertation itself, include the training of Peruvian archaeology students as field and lab assistants. The project also aims to create awareness among the local community about the importance of their pre-Hispanic monuments and heritage. Luya has been and continues to be heavily looted, a problem fueled by socioeconomic factors and a lack of knowledge about the cultural and sustainable value of archaeological sites. Community workshops will thus be organized twice a month, along with lectures at local public schools, to explain the results of the scientific archaeological excavations at Luya, thus contextualizing the information about cultural heritage. Likewise, fieldwork will be carried out by a crew of local workers. Considering the current value of archaeological restoration projects in the region, this project will provide local people with the basic tools to organize future conservation, management, and sustainable economic and heritage projects such as tourism.

583,"Rice University has a dynamic geometry group, with senior faculty in low- dimensional topology; quasi-crystals, spectral theory, and mathematical physics; geometric measure theory; algebraic and complex geometry; and Teichmueller theory and minimal surfaces.  This project will support a Research Training Group led by these faculty, involving undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.  Our main objective is to increase the number of students and postdocs pursuing independent research in geometry, as well as related areas of topology and analysis.Geometric problems stimulate progress across almost every subfield of mathematics.  The study of conic sections initiated by the ancient Greeks spurred the development of coordinate systems and polynomial algebra in the 17th century, leading to the modern field of algebraic geometry.  The desire to find curves and surfaces minimizing the energy of physical systems motivated the development of calculus.  More recently, geometric questions about knots and links have led to numerous advances in modern algebra.  Thus geometric examples offer common ground where specialists in different areas can exchange ideas and techniques.  The Geometry Group at Rice builds on this common ground to train students and postdoctoral fellows in the methods of mathematical research.

The host scientist is Yang Chia-lin.The Intellectual Merit of the research project is manyfold. Targeting GPUs for preemptive work scheduling is a topic not extensively reported in the current literature. The concept of multiprogramming has traditionally focused on CPUs with a single thread of execution. By their parallel nature GPU architectures are already inherently multi-threaded, making them a less obvious target for multiprogramming. The complexities of memory management would also have hindered multiprogramming in the past, however, the additional memory options in the latest NVIDIA Fermi architecture allow for easier memory management in the GPU. These new features make it more feasible to suspend and resume computations without introducing an unacceptable amount of overhead because moving task data is not as complicated as it was with older GPU architectures.Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

586,"1150645Qutub, AminaThis project seeks to develop a robust, innovative computational model of the cellular events in microvasculature regeneration as they might occur in the brain in response to hypoxia.   This fundamental research bridges the gap between theoretical biology and clinical application, and offers insight into repair mechanisms for ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases ? conditions affecting over 50 million people in the U.S.Intellectual Merit:  Knowledge of the neurovasculature interface, the area where blood vessels and brain cells meet, opens doors to understanding how humans sustain energy for mental activities, recover from ischemic brain damage, and defend themselves from neurodegeneration.  Neuro¬degen¬eration and brain ischemia are associated with hypoxic response and the formation of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis.  In these disease conditions, the supply of oxygen does not keep pace with the brain?s needs.  Regulating cellular hypoxic response and enhancing microvascular growth are potential ways to treat ischemia and minimize neurodegeneration.  Despite their promise as a therapeutic target, hypoxia response pathways within the neuro¬vas¬culature interface have yet to be well understood or explored in detail, computationally or experimentally.  In this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will develop a model of brain microvasculature formation in hypoxia.  The project?s ultimate goal is a mechanistically-detailed, quantitative theory of how brain microvasculature forms as a result of decisions made by single cells.  To reach its goal, this research involves two steps: (1) characterizing how neurovascular cells process information from their environment; and (2) linking patterns in cell behaviors to intracellular protein signaling.   Hypotheses for cell behaviors will be explored computationally using a new framework developed by the PI and iteratively compared to in vitro assays.  Cell behaviors will be mapped to intracellular protein expression through an integrated experimental-computational approach employing high-throughput array technologies.  Results will offer the ability to understand ? and ultimately program ? human cell behavior at the neurovascular interface.    Broader Impacts: Impacts of this research span biology, engineering, and education.  How cells interact to form brain capillaries has relevancy to organism development, mammalian synthetic biology, and tissue engineering.  The project will foster the development of high-throughput assays coupled to imaging and proteomic analysis, technologies with applications in cell biology, bioengineering, and pharmacology.  The PI?s computer framework allows rapid hypothesis testing, useable in research across labs and fields.  The project also supports the development of three new modeling techniques that can be broadly applied to study patterns in cell behavior as a function of molecular signaling.  Furthermore, models resulting from the work will be able to simulate vessel regeneration in neurovascular diseases for applications to regenerative medicine and protein-based drug development.  The PI plans to stimulate interest in the growing field of computational systems biology through outreach programs in the Houston community, at Rice, and internationally, through open source web technology.  The PI will provide the computer platform for rapid hypothesis testing and the 3D angi¬ogenesis models to the public, on her laboratory website and in model repositories.  A user-friendly inter¬face and an iPhone App will give wide, free accessibility.  Students worldwide will be able to interact with the model as it runs, and learn about computational systems biology and the microvasculature.  This technology will foster inquiry-based teaching, where students will be encouraged to pose testable hypotheses, and design, run, and analyze experi¬ments.  Training with the models will be inte¬grated into workshops for high school students organized through the Houston Health Museum and development of an undergraduate modeling lab.  To fill the need for interdisciplinary computational training at the graduate and postgraduate level, the PI will grow the Complex Systems Workshops she initiated within the Gulf Coast community and remain an active, core member of Rice?s new Systems & Synthetic Biology program.

587,"PI: C. Robin Buell (Michigan State University) Co-PIs: Yuehua Cui and David Douches (Michigan State University), Jiming Jiang (University of Wisconsin-Madison), and Richard Veilleux (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University)Potato is the third most important food crop in the world following rice and wheat and is cultivated for its tuber, a below-ground storage organ. Potato is distinct from many other major crops in that it is asexually propagated, has four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid), and all cultivars are highly heterozygous. As a consequence, potato has a greater probability of retaining deleterious gene mutations than sexually propagated diploids such as rice, maize, and soybean. These three characteristics make genetic improvement of potato slow and unpredictable due to a lack of understanding of the interaction of genetic elements in a complex background. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge regarding the molecular nature of heterozygosity and allelic composition in the potato genome and how these correlate with phenotype. The objectives of this project are to understand the contribution of genes/alleles, transcripts, copy number variation and epigenomic features to a complex of phenotypic traits associated with fitness in potato. Data to be generated from this project will include characterization of the genome, transcriptome and epigenome from multiple potato populations with differential degrees of chromosome number and heterozygosity and statistical analyses to identify genes and alleles associated with a set of phenotypes associated with vigor. These data will also facilitate modeling genomic features into phenotype. Many of the genetic and genomic questions associated with potato cannot be readily addressed by using diploid model plants. Project efforts to probe the genetic complexities of potato will serve as a model genomics system for other vegetatively propagated, highly heterozygous crops with similarly intractable breeding systems, including alfalfa, banana, cassava, grape, strawberry, sugarcane, sweet potato, yam and scores of minor horticultural crops, thereby improving the understanding of the genetic machinery underlying phenotypic diversity. Through outreach activities in this project, the public will gain knowledge of plant biology, specifically in the uses of potato and its unique biology, through a suite of activities with the Michigan State University Children's and Horticulture Garden involving all age groups. Through engagement of high school and under-represented groups, this project will provide opportunities for students to see science as a viable career opportunity and increase the representation of women in computer-related science/technology disciplines. The techniques and approaches used in this project will provide a rich training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in relevant and emerging disciplines of bioinformatics, genomics, and epigenomics.  The data to be generated in this project through publication and deposition in public databases will provide the first high-resolution map of genome variation and its association with gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and phenotypic traits in potato.  Sequence data will be made public through the project website (to be accessible via http://buell-lab.plantbiology.msu.edu/), the SOL Genomics Network (http://solgenomics.net/) and through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus for permanent archiving.

588,"PI: Joseph Kieber (University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill)CoPIs: G. Eric Schaller (Dartmouth College) and Ann Loraine (University of North Carolina - Charlotte)Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate many traits of agricultural importance, including the control of grain size and yield. In this project, genomic approaches will be used to uncover how cytokinin regulates growth and development in rice, using this plant species as a model to understand the regulation of grain size and yield in all cereals. Computational approaches will be used to interrogate and integrate the datasets generated by these studies. It is expected that these studies will illuminate the role of cytokinins in panicle development, and will provide specific information on how cytokinins regulate grain development in an agriculturally important crop. Because of conservation of gene sequence among cereals, information obtained from the study of rice may be applied to other agriculturally important species such as maize, wheat, barley, rye, and sorghum. This project will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by providing training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. A computation workshop will broaden the ability of the research community to use genomics resources. In addition, through partnerships with local groups including the Montshire Museum of Science (http://montshire.org/), programs aimed at fostering science education in grades K-12 will be created and maintained. Data will be made available through a public database (RiceCytokinin.org) as well as through long-term repositories such as the NCBI Short Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

589,"PI: Frank White (Kansas State University)Co-PIs: Adam Bogdanove (Cornell University), Bing Yang (Iowa State University), and Volker Brendel (Indiana University)Rice, a major food source for the world population, presents an excellent opportunity for in-depth analyses of the adaptive processes of plant disease susceptibility. In particular, the two groups of bacteria within the species Xanthomonas oryzae are the causal agents of bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak diseases of rice. The bacteria cause disease, in part, modulating host gene expression utilizing a remarkable repertoire of transcription activation-like (TAL) effectors. TAL effectors are proteins synthesized in bacteria and transferred to plant cells during the infection process. The host transcriptional responses to TAL effector attack are complex, and unraveling of the transcriptional  shock  due to the large repertoire of TAL effectors injected into the host cells behooves a more detailed understanding of host gene response to individual TAL effectors. At the same time, other disease complexes that involve large repertoires of TAL effectors in the respective pathogen, and additional disease complexes will be profiled. This project will characterize the host gene expression responses to infection by Xanthomonas pathogens of rice, wheat, cotton, soybeans, and alfalfa using high through-put nucleic acid sequencing technologies. The role played by select host genes whose expression is found to be highly up-regulated in response to specific TAL effectors will be analyzed using advanced gene targeting technologies. TAL effectors function by binding to sequences in the host genome that direct the expression of individual genes, which are known as promoters. The project will also develop refined bioinformatic tools derived from shared features of promoters that are targeted by specific TAL effectors. This information will improve our insight into the vulnerabilities of plants to transcriptional shock and greatly further our ability to predict TAL effector target sites in a genome and to effectively design custom TAL effectors for targeted gene manipulation. This project will elucidate the processes in rice susceptibility and resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak, and establish important, broadly relevant concepts of plant-pathogen interactions and TAL effector biotechnology. The results will provide insight into strategies for achieving durable and broad resistance against disease, which, in itself, can have wide-reaching impacts on the environment and quality of life. The research will enhance the educational environments at ISU, KSU, Cornell, and IU and strengthen international collaborative research. Research activities will be integrated with education and outreach by mentoring graduate student and postdocs, providing internships for under-represented undergraduate students, and providing research experiences to high school students and teachers.

590,"Seasonal weather changes determine the timing of many life-history events, including bird migration, plant flowering, and frog breeding.  However, the specific set of weather cues that signal these events differs among species; some species may respond to temperature, others to rainfall.  Therefore, year-to-year differences in weather can result in different responses among species, which can alter the timing of when species arrive or become active in a given area and which other species they may encounter.  This could affect the outcome of species interactions, such competition or predation.  The investigators of this project will experimentally manipulate colonization patterns of newly-hatched insects and amphibians in ponds.  Specifically, they will vary arrival synchrony of individuals within a species as well as arrival time of species relative to one another.  The goal is to determine how differences in arrival time and synchrony affect growth rates and survival of interacting species.  Understanding how seasonal variation impacts species interactions is crucial because global climate change is altering the annual activities of species throughout the world.  Although many studies have documented such  phenological shifts,  the consequences for species interactions -- and ultimately the biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems -- remain poorly known.  To help complete this project, the investigators will hire and mentor an undergraduate student, who will be recruited from the Rice NSF AGEP program (a program that seeks to increase underrepresented groups in science).  Also, the investigators are organizing a citizen scientist project to monitor the phenologies of local plants and animals, with the goal of training community members to generate data for a National Phenology Network program, called Nature's Notebook.  Data contributed to this program are used by scientists, educators, policy-makers, and resource managers to understand the effects of climate change and other environmental changes.

591,"The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) and the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) programs of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Christy Landes of Rice University. Prof. Landes and her research group will develop and apply state of the art single molecule spectroscopic techniques for understanding and controlling transport in charged polymer membranes. The research is thus focused on the water/membrane interface, and will address questions such as how molecules move in charged and crowded environments. The ultimate goal is to be able to predict and control heterogeneous processes in interfacial materials at the molecular scale.  The chemical systems to be studied have direct relevance to the heterogeneous phenomena that occur at the environmental water/soil interface. The project will increase our understanding of how molecular-scale dynamics relate to macro-scale interfacial properties. These topics relate to general large-scale issues such as a future shortage of clean energy and water, and more directly to separations and water purification applications.  Students working on this project will receive an excellent educational opportunity because it represents an interdisciplinary research project that relates chemistry, physics, materials science and environmental science.

592,"Prof. Cecilia Clementi of Rice University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to   develop multiscale protein models and new strategies to explore complex free energy landscapes. This project uses coarse graining as the starting point to develop multi-resolution protein models, which are combined with a theoretically robust framework involving a supersymmetric generalization of the Fokker-Planck diffusion equation, and a mathematically rigorous definition of collective variables. These methods are applied to rapidly locate rare event regions in molecular dynamics landscapes, and give a robust foundation for benchmarking and creating new models of complex systems. The developed methodology is used to characterize the functional aspects of protein dynamics on timescales out of reach to conventional approaches.The broader impacts of this research are in the biological sciences.

593,"Under the guidance of Dr. Prudence Rice, Katherine South will examine the emergence of status differentiation during the Middle Preclassic period (1000-350 BC) in the Maya lowlands through the study of pottery and its depositional contexts. Throughout Mesoamerica, the Middle Preclassic was a time of transition in social, economic, and political development, with emerging status differentiation evident in rare, exotic materials such as jade and shell. This study instead investigates abundant, locally made pottery and how it was used, manipulated, and valued as part of these societal transitions.  The Middle Preclassic pottery analyzed was previously excavated from four communities (sites) in the Petén lakes region of Guatemala, where Maya had begun building substantial constructions.  The research is important in a context which extends beyond Mayan archaeology for two reasons. First, it will provide insight into how social complexity and status hierarchies emerge. Secondly it will help to develop an analytic technique which archaeologists may apply in many contexts and in many regions of the world.The project focuses on the ways value was encoded in this pottery.  Unlike painted polychromes of the Classic period, Middle Preclassic pottery displayed little overt status-marking decoration, suggesting that its value was based on its function and use ( use-value ) rather than attributes related to the labor of production ( production-value ) such as surface decoration.  Thus the study examines the role of use-value in Middle Preclassic pottery through an integrated analysis that includes: visual classification based on vessel shape and typological designation; contextual information based on where it was excavated; and compositional study that focuses on the clay recipes used by the potters in production. These analyses will provide information not only about production choices, but also about differences among sites and depositional contexts, thereby emphasizing the importance of contextual information when considering the role of object-value in the archaeological record.  This comprehensiveness permits not only study of  how pottery was valued by the early Maya in the Petén lakes region, but connects to larger anthropological questions of how emerging status differentiation in communities impacted the notion of value in material culture in general and the processes underlying development of prestigious goods in complex societies.Beyond investigating how early Maya pottery was valued, this study seeks to demonstrate the importance of an integrated approach to artifact analysis that takes into account both contextual and physical attributes.  This project will provide graduate student training while also extending the opportunity for collaboration among researchers who study early pottery in the Maya lowlands.  Additionally, the project will create a type collection and catalog of early Maya pottery in the lakes region, which will enable Guatemalan and foreign researchers to study representative samples of this material. Results of the study will be made available through a doctoral dissertation and, in English and Spanish, in peer-reviewed journals and at professional meetings in the United States and Guatemala. Data will also be made available online through the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR).

594,"1239722MathurIntellectual Merits. This proposal to the National Science Foundation (NSF) requests partial support of the 28th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC), to be held May 4-May 6, 2012, at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and co-hosted by Rice University and Methodist Research Hospital Institute. Funds from the NSF will be used to provide partial support for student awards, keynote speakers, publicity and supplies, and conference publications.The overall themes of this conference series is  Translational and Basic Science Research in Bioengineering and Medicine.  The broad impact of this conference falls within the various areas of Biomedical Engineering such as Computational Modeling, Bioinformatics, Imaging, Cell and Tissue Engineering, Nanotechnology, Clinical Applications of Technology, and Medical Devices. Since this meeting is being held at MD Anderson this year it will particularly highlight researchers who are not only conducting basic science research but also translational research. The field of biomedical engineering is rapidly evolving. Meetings and conferences provide the means for individuals to promote and disseminate advances they have made, subject to peer and professional critique. These gatherings are most valuable venues for discussing new directions, ideas and approaches for research and education. They also aid both in reinforcing contacts and collaborations and establishing new ones. The Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference draws heavily from institutions and organizations in the South, Southwest, and Southeast regions of the US; but from the beginning, many from outside of the region and even other countries have actively participated in this regional conference. In the past conferences many distinguished scientists, biomedical engineers, and physicians have participated, which included even a Nobel Laureate.Board Impact. The abstracts will be disseminated by publishing in the Program Abstract Book. The Proceedings from the conference will be published in a CD format and provided to the conference attendees. It is planned to encourage a selected set of high-impact publications for subsequent publication in a book or journal format. The SBEC program committee will identify these authors through the abstract review and presentation process. Invitations and announcement posters has been mailed to the chairpersons of all bioengineering and biomedical engineering departments and programs located throughout the United States. Conference flyers have been mailed to all faculty and graduate students in appropriate programs at US institutions. Posters and flyers will also be mailed to members of appropriate technical Societies and other bioengineering mailing lists available to us. Announcements will be posted and distributed on the internet via e-mail and list serve groups and through linking the Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference homepage to other biomedical engineering sites such as Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES). The conference has been announced at the BMES website. Recognizing the importance of diversity is a priority and we plan to support students and faculty from diverse backgrounds by giving them an opportunity to present at the meeting with award support. The SBEC serves a special purpose by emphasizing student participation. Unlike national meetings, the participation of students (undergraduate, graduate, and professional) is strongly encouraged. Work presented by student authors, while their mentors observe, helps them develop public speaking skills and establish self-confidence in their presentations. Established investigators will present papers in the same sessions with the students, thus encouraging a high level of professionalism as a standard for the students and allowing students to hear well-known authorities in the field as well. In keeping with the emphasis on student participation, the SBEC presents best paper awards to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students based on both their written papers and presentations at the conference. At large national and international meetings, many students are either overwhelmed or lost in the crowd. The Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference strives to create a more relaxed and more personal environment. This is beneficial to all attendees but particularly important for students and young investigators. Indeed, the conference's emphasis on students encourages them to be actively involved, not just by attending, but by participating and contributing to the conference through their individual presentations. It is important to note that some of the organizers of recent SBEC conferences did their very first conference presentation at SBEC when they were doctoral students or young assistant professors. Despite being primarily a regional conference, attendees in the past have come from all over the US as well as foreign countries. The audience size of the Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference allows interactions between students and prominent biomedical engineers and researchers are both possible and likely. These interactions are key to the continued development and advancement of biomedical engineering. abstracting; Area; authority; Award; base; Basic Science; Bioinformatics; Biomedical Engineering; Books; cellular engineering; Chairperson; clinical application; Collaborations; Computer Simulation; Country; Critiques; Crowding; Development; doctoral student; Education; Environment; Faculty; falls; Foundations; Funding; graduate student; Hearing; Hospitals; Image; Individual; Institutes; Institution; International; Internet; Journals; Link; Mails; Medical Device; Medicine; meetings; member; Mentors; Methodist Church; Nanotechnology; Paper; peer; Physicians; posters; Process; professor; programs; Public Speaking; Publications; Publishing; Research; Research Personnel; Rice; Science; Scientist; Series; Site; skills; Societies; Students; symposium; Technology; Tissue Engineering; Translational Research; United States; Universities; University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center; web site; Work; WritingSOUTHERN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING CONFERENCE (28TH) ON MAY 4-6, 2012 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS M.D. ANDERSON CANCER CENTER",0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
595,"In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division, Dr. B. Montgomery Pettitt, from the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, seeks to understand, through computational approaches, the role of the solubility of the backbone and side chains in folding and recognition in peptides and proteins.The mechanisms governing recognition between proteins and the transition of proteins from their unfolded state to their native state in cells still remain as elusive fundamental questions. Recent experiments studying the interactions between cellular osmolytes and proteins have challenged the prevailing paradigm of the protein folding mechanism. Interpretation of those experiments holds that the backbone solubility difference in osmolyte is a dominant driving force rather than just the sidechains. Recent theoretical efforts to date have not resolved the issue. Dr. Pettitt's goals are to computationally test hypotheses concerning the magnitude of the nonideal backbone solubility in comparison to side chain solvation as driving forces in protein folding. His group will use glycine oligomers as models for the protein backbone and alanine oligomers as small fast folders to understand side chain effects in quantitative comparison to backbone.This research effort aims to resolve a critical issue concerning the chemical driving force for all protein folding. This goal has many far reaching societal benefits and is generally important for the fields of protein engineering and biotechnology. As such it will provide numerous interdisciplinary opportunities for the inclusion of women and underrepresented groups in the project. All participants will be encouraged to attend both national and local meetings of relevance. Dr. Pettitt is well positioned to recruit minority and female students and post-doctorates to participate in this project.

596,"Parasitic angiosperms are noxious and persistent pests in farmers' fields and serious constraints to crop productivity. The  witchweeds , members of the genus Striga, are particularly devastating since their primary hosts include the major cereals (maize, sorghum, rice and millet) and grain legumes that are dietary staples worldwide. How parasitic weeds and Striga species in particular recognize their potential hosts and overcome the innate defense systems are not known. Using the interaction of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), an important food and forage legume, with Striga gesnerioides, this project seeks to identify parasite-derived effectors and virulence proteins that enter host cells, specifically altering their structure and function and suppressing the defense response mechanism at various levels, enabling infection and parasite ingress to occur. Novel, in planta functional screens will be used to identify candidate effectors from Striga that are directly or indirectly recognized by race-specific resistance proteins in cowpea leading to activation of a hypersensitive response at the point of infection and associated downstream defense responses. These functional screens are complemented by comparative transcriptome sequencing in compatible and incompatible host-parasite association and in silico analysis aimed at identifying candidate virulence effectors through race-specific gene expression signatures. The outcomes of this project will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which parasitic angiosperms identify and parasitize their hosts and how hosts block such attack. The negative impact of parasitic plants on crop productivity increases globally each year and their potential for affecting domestic agriculture looms larger as the movement of seed resources expands globally. The outcomes of this work will contribute directly to the development of strategies to improve crop security by providing targets for manipulating pest resistance responses of crop plants. In addition these studies provide new educational, research, and training opportunities for US students on the African continent.

597,"Under the guidance of Dr. Robert Tykot and in collaboration with the Sino-American archaeology team of Shandong University, Rheta Lanehart will investigate the presence of lipid residues in various types of ceramic vessels from ancient China in order to identify foodstuffs such as protein, grains, and other plants. The goal of the research is to identify different patterns of food consumption across space and time. Based upon the residue results, it will be possible to provide interpretations about social and ritual activities in relation to social change at the site of Liangchengzhen in southeastern Shandong province. China is an area long associated with the social importance of food consumption and the investigation of vessels from Liangchengzhen presents a rare opportunity to examine food consumption at a large regional Longshan period (ca. 2600-1900 BC) center. There is limited information about the nature of activities at Longshan period regional centers, although social and ritual activities have been inferred. The Liangchengzhen excavation team uncovered a series of occupation levels containing over 400 pits, numerous house foundations, and several burials. The pits in particular contain large quantities of ceramic vessels, the main source of data for the project. The research will provide a systematic analysis of the residues from a variety of ceramic forms excavated from pits that are promising for evidence of different kinds of social relations, competitive or integrative. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique will be employed. Alkane biomarkers, previously identified in a pilot study, will be used to identify food sources in the pottery residues. Interpretations will be made about the nature of consumption activities over time on the basis of vessels deposited in pits that are hypothesized as offering pits and storage or trash pits. In addition, consideration will be given to spatial and chronological variation at the center with respect to the consumption of hypothesized preferred foods (meat, rice).  The project will provide a foundation for broader applications of lipid residue research to the interpretation of consumption and will foster international collaboration. Findings from the research will be reported to Chinese authorities and published in professional journals as well as in venues for the general public, both Chinese and American. Presentations of the research will be given while in China and also to undergraduate and graduate students at the University of South Florida and elsewhere. Online access to the research will be available through Open Context and a website created by the researcher.

Cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice and barley are most affected by drought during the time of flowering and initiation of grain formation, causing drastic yield losses. The goal of this project is to develop a systems biology view of drought responses in cereals to understand this complex process and improve drought resistance and water use efficiency. Genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis of drought responses in rice and maize will be integrated into a cereal drought gene interaction network, using ortholog information to predict conserved functional relationships as a basis for cereals. Conserved orthologous regulatory genes between rice and maize involved in drought responses and resistance will be identified comprising transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases and phosphatases, genes in hormone signaling pathways, chromatin binding proteins, protein degradation and small RNA pathways. As proof of principle, a set of these putative conserved rice and maize genes will be tested by genetic analysis of mutants and natural allelic variants, assessing them for altered drought response phenotypes and perturbation in the drought gene interaction network. These analyses will validate and improve the cereal gene interaction network predictions, and provide candidate genes for improvement of drought resistance/tolerance in cereals. With respect to broader impacts, this project will contribute through the generation of information key to the development of stable food production systems worldwide and through the creation of a transdisciplinary educational environment. Scientifically, the project will demonstrate the use of an integrated network approach to understand complex plant responses such as drought response and resistance. Outreach and training activities are integrated within the transdisciplinary plant-lab-bioinformatics project and will be made accessible to high school and underrepresented undergraduate students from institutions across Virginia and North Carolina through established programs at Virginia Tech and other nearby universities. An outreach program developed as part of a NSF-Cyberinfrastructure Training, Education, Advancement, and Mentoring for Our 21st Century Workforce (CI-TEAM) project will provide modules for quantitative data analysis for teachers and students using socio-environmental case studies from research data. An integrated mentor program for postdoctoral researchers will be used to facilitate career development. International research collaborations with the Generation Challenge Program and CGIAR institutes involved in drought research will add capacity building to agricultural systems worldwide.  Plant genotypes and all data developed in the project will be made available through a project website (http://cereal-drought.vbi.vt.edu/) that will allow interactive access to data and networks. Other publicly available genetic stocks used will be distributed by the respective originators with long term public repositories.

600,"This award provides continued support for a successful 10-week summer REU site within the Statistics Department at Rice University for the study of Statistics and its applications. As the number of domestic graduate students in the Mathematical Sciences continues to decline, there is a critical need to develop human resources to continue supporting the United States' advantage in the world of science and technology. The Rice University Summer Institute of Statistics (RUSIS), now in its 10th year and fourth funding cycle, has been successful in encouraging students to pursue graduate degrees in Mathematics and Statistics. Roughly 85% of the students who have attended RUSIS and have graduated, are now doctoral students in Ph.D. programs around the country, and roughly 61% of them are members of underrepresented populations in Mathematics. RUSIS has accomplished this through intensive courses, close supervision of research projects, and visits to various research institutes and agencies in Houston. The program will train and mentor 12 (7 NSF- and 5 NSA-supported) selected underrepresented minority students and students with no easy access to a research experience at their institution, including community college students, through intensive core courses in probability, stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest; e.g. multiple comparisons, extreme value theory, multivariate survival analysis, risk-reliability-sustainability of complex infrastructure systems, artificial intelligence, statistical learning, statistical genetics, and general biostatistics. The RUSIS engages the students in research projects under close collaboration with faculty mentors, and with the objective of producing joint publications, when the summer work merits it. Students present their results at national meetings and they are mentored in the preparation and presentation of their talks. In addition, students meet with an advisory committee composed of top scientists and present their work to them. The RUSIS also teaches short courses on the use of Unix platforms, LaTeX, and software to be utilized for research purposes such as Mathematica, Splus and/or R, and Matlab. In addition, the program organizes student and faculty visits to scientific facilities (e.g., Biomathematics and Biostatistics at MD Anderson Cancer Center, NASA). Through informal meetings, the program discusses a variety of topics ranging from applying to Graduate School to career experiences by outstanding scientists, and discussion of cutting-edge topics in Statistics. The program evaluates and monitors the progress of students for seven years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their participation, and an annual evaluation of the program by the participating students and an external advisory committee is an integral and valuable part of the program. The investment is starting to produce concrete results. The first RUSIS alumnus received his Ph.D. during the summer of 2011 and is now an assistant professor of statistical sciences in a Ph.D. program. Several more are due to obtain their PhDs in the next few years.

601,"Global climate change and associated impacts on our national inland waters have led to new pressures for better land and water resource management. This is true to an even greater extent on native reservations, which deal with complicated resource management issues and lack young native scientists to meet current needs.  A better understanding of biological, chemical, ecological and physical processes is needed to form a solid foundation for predictive approaches to resource management.  The Research Experience for Undergraduates Site on Sustainable Land and Water Resources will engage 14 undergraduate students per year for three years in the key elements of sustainable land and water resources research that are essential to improving management practices.  Resource management is interdisciplinary in nature requiring knowledge of biological, chemical, ecological and physical processes that continuously shape and alter the Earth's near-surface environment.  Improving resource management practices is socially relevant and of acknowledged national importance. Students in this REU program will be engaged in research projects that have immediate social relevance to US communities, including native reservations. Students will work on one of three teams on projects that integrate Earth-surface dynamics, ecology, geology, hydrology, neolimnology (study of inland waters) and paleolimnology principles and techniques.  The program takes an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods. One team will focus on an experimental approach to one of two problems at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory: (1) improving stream restoration practices for ecosystem health and fish habitat or (2) debris flow hazards; one team will examine the effects of surface water management practice on groundwater resources in Montana; and one team will investigate past and present habitat conditions of wild rice lakes in northern Minnesota. An All-Team Gathering at the conclusion of the program will expose all students to an ethics program that considers student research in the context of the community and students will present their research to a large group of faculty and students.

602,"Intellectual Merit: Heterotrimeric G-proteins consisting of Galpha, Gbeta and Ggamma subunits regulate some of the most important signaling pathways in eukaryotes. In metazoans, evolutionary diversification has led to the presence of a large number of G-proteins and associated components that regulate a multitude of signaling pathways with a high degree of specificity.  In contrast, plants have a very limited number of G-proteins that integrate a plethora of signaling pathways to modulate overall growth and development. This observation has led to the hypothesis that the plant G-proteins have evolved differently from the metazoan G-proteins in accordance with the sedentary lifestyle of plants. Detailed studies of the structure/function attributes of plant G-proteins is currently mostly limited to Arabidopsis which restricts the knowledge of why and when during evolution the plant G-proteins emerged as modulators of multiple signals. It is also not known if the G-proteins have evolved to play critical roles in biological processes that are unique to specific plant lineages. Furthermore, the presence of certain unconventional G-protein components in plants suggests their role(s) in regulating novel, as yet unexplored G-proteins signaling mechanisms. The availability of fully sequenced genomes from a number of plant species at important evolutionary nodes and the PIs extensive experience working with G-protein signaling using complementary approaches including biochemical, molecular-genetics and genome/proteome-scale analyses, puts her in an excellent position to address some of the key questions related to the plant G-protein signaling. Towards this, important preliminary data have been generated related to G-proteins components and their activity from Arabidopsis, rice, soybean, Physcomitrella, Selaginella, Brachypodium and Aquilegia. This research has been developed with the overall objective to understand the functional evolution of the G-protein core components and their interaction in plants, and to infer the conventional and novel signaling mechanisms and their role in regulating signaling pathways involved in plant adaptation and yield. To accomplish this objective, following specific aims will be pursued:      Aim 1. Biochemical characterization of the enzymatically active proteins of the G-protein complex in the context of their evolutionary diversification      Aim 2. Evaluation of the role of G-proteins from across different taxa in regulating the signaling pathways important in the context of land plant evolution The material and intellectual resources generated from this research will be made publicly available through the Arabidopsis stock center and through our website. The long term benefits of the research include comprehensive knowledge of the evolution of G-protein components and signaling mechanisms in plants and their roles in regulating pathways controlling agronomically important traits. Broader Impact: This research addresses the fundamental aspects of plant signaling and evolution. Given the involvement of G-protein in regulating important agronomic traits such as seed development and physiology, abiotic stress tolerance and water use efficiency, the knowledge gained from this research will be useful for engineering important agricultural traits to the benefit of society. Moreover, the research specifically incorporates training for high-school students and teachers through the STARS program and undergraduate students through the REU program. The PI is actively involved in recruiting, mentoring and training of undergraduate students as a co-director of the Danforth Center REU program; and graduate students through her participation in Washington University plant biology recruitment, thesis committees and teaching. The proposed research offers multidisciplinary training to the post-docs in various aspects of modern plant biology. The PI is strongly committed to provide training and mentoring opportunities to post-docs to help them establish their independent careers.  The PI is actively involved in developing scientific awareness in the local community through multiple volunteering programs offered at the Center, including participation in the ¡¥Ask a Plant Scientist¡¦ column and ¡¥Conversations¡¦ series, which offers an interactive session between local public and scientists.

603,"The Tech Topology Conference will be held December 9-11 at Georgia Institute of Technology.  This is a new annual conference on geometry and topology, with an emphasis on highlighting and enhancing research being done in the Southeast US.  We will have seven speakers, in the areas of contact topology, geometric group theory, and knot theory, and we will have participants from Georgia Tech, Florida State, Sevilla, Emory, Georgia, Columbia, Penn State, Rice, Clemson, and Tennessee. Over the past few years, there has been an incredible amount of cross-fertilization between the fields of surface topology, contact topology, knot theory, and group theory.  At this conference, we will have specialists in each of these areas, whose work lies at the interface of two more more of these areas.  As such, the conference will be a fertile ground for new ideas in geometry and topology.The main goals of the conference are (1) To provide a high-profile geometry-topology conference to the Southeast that brings leaders of the field to the area as well as showcases the high quality mathematics being done in the Southeast, and (2) To provide a convenient meeting place for Southeastern researchers and students to gather, discuss, research, and interact with leading mathematicians from across the country.  This conference will be a valuable learning environment for graduate students and junior faculty in the Southeast, and will help raise the profile of the region.  We will provide ample time for the participants to meet, formally and informally, for example during long breaks between talks and organized discussion sessions.  We plan to post notes from all the talks on the conference web site.

604,"The International Conference on Stochastic Processes in Systems Biology, Genetics and Evolution, to be held at Rice University on August 21-25, 2012, will focus on emerging trends within the field of systems biology with a focus on the statistical methodologies and probability models that are most valued within the field. Special attention will be given to emerging challenges in systems biology, such as exploring the role of cancer stem cells in tumor development and progression, characterizing the systems pathways in inflammation which trigger sepsis, models of antibiotic resistance, and many other challenges in genetics and evolution. Symposia Topics: Systems Biology, Genetics and Evolution: New Challenges for Stochastic Dynamics Stochastic Processes for New Biology, Stochasticity of Cell Differentiation and Cell Fates, Stochastic Models of Cancer, Stochastic Gene Expression and Intracellular Signaling Pathways, Self-Organization, Epigenetics & Evolution, Branching Processs in Population Biology and Genetics, Stochastic Theory for Biochemical Systems. Junior researchers, students and under-represented groups are offered travel and subsistence assistance.Recent years witnessed an explosion of biological data, which allow accurate insight into functioning of living beings at the levels ranging from genetic code to biomolecules, cells, tissues and organisms. Due to these new data, it became possible to understand how different levels of organization (scales) of living beings interact. This new science is called systems biology. From the very outset, systems biology has been more mathematically inclined than traditional disciplines of biology. In particular, it is attempting to understand the role randomness (or stochasticity) plays in functioning of living beings. For example, how is it possible that individual biological cells respond in very different ways to environmental stimuli, whereas the organism as a whole is capable of mounting a coherent response?

605,"This workshop project helps support the 2012 Finite Element Rodeo conference that takes place in March 2012 at Rice University.  The workshop has attracted around one hundred participants mostly from the states of Texas and Louisiana. Registration fees for junior participants are waived. Topics covered in the workshop consist of recent advances in the theory and implementation of the general class of finite element methods, including mixed finite element methods, boundary element methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods and finite volume methods.As scientists attempt to solve more and more complex problems, there is an increasing need for accurate and robust numerical methods. Uncertainty, multiple physics, multiple time and spatial scales are examples of challenges associated with complex problems. Participants of the Finite Element Rodeo address those issues by formulation, rigorous analysis and efficient implementation of state-of-the-art numerical methods. The informal nature of the workshop makes it well-suited for introducing new research ideas. Applications discussed in the workshop cover many engineering fields including energy, environment and biomedicine. Networking and collaboration developing is encouraged among participants.

606,"Plants capture the energy of the sun in the process of photosynthesis, but this is an inefficient process that limits their growth potential. Some bacteria have specialized structures (called carboxysomes) that increase their efficiency of photosynthesis, and if carboxysomes can be introduced into crop plants such as rice, wheat and soybeans it is anticipated that this would improve their growth and yield. The smaller the number of proteins that are needed to reconstitute functional carboxysomes, the easier it will be to succeed. The goal of this project is to combine the roles of two carboxysome proteins into one; in other words, one protein will play two essential roles by combining structural and enzymatic functions.  It is proposed to develop two types of bi-functional carboxysome proteins:  one that will help deliver carbon dioxide to the interior of the carboxysome, where it will be available to RUBISCO, a key enzyme of photosynthesis; the second will detoxify a molecule (2-phosphoglycolate) that is formed as an unwanted by-product of chemical reactions that compete with photosynthesis.Broader Impacts: This project will provide interdisciplinary training in biochemistry, protein chemistry and synthetic biology to a postdoctoral fellow and to undergraduate students. In addition it will explore innovative approaches to the engineering of structures such as the carboxysome and has the potential to improve crop yields for both food and biofuel.

607,"The researchers intend to develop a database organizing sentence data from three highly endangered Alaskan Athabascan languages: Koyukon, Lower Tanana, and Upper Tanana. Much of the data is already available in published and manuscript dictionaries, or in texts and language learning materials, but it is not currently accessible to researchers and language teachers in readily comparable form.  Additional data will be collected as part of this project to fill gaps and to enrich and clarify what has been previously archived.   The database will organize the data from two perspectives: form-to-function and function-to-form. In selecting the constructions/forms to be included, we will consult a number of grammars of other Athabascan languages such as Rice (1989) and de Reuse and Goode (2006). In the selection of functions to be included, we will use extant tools such as the World Atlas on Language Structures (Dryer & Haspelmath 2011) and the GOLD ontology (Farrar & Langedoen 2003) to build our categories. Examples of search terms on the formal side are independent pronouns, classifiers, interrogative particles, or extra-high tone (to name but a few); on the functional side commands (both positive and negative), questions, topicalization, and many more.   Searching by form will be useful to researchers familiar with Athabascan languages; searching by function to researchers interested in typological questions. Additionally, this tool will be a helpful resource for Athabascan language learners and educators, who need references for curriculum development.

608,"Intellectual Merit By conservative UN estimates, the world's human population is expected to surpass 9 billion by 2050. At the same time, arable land, clean water and phosphate fertilizers are increasingly limited resources. At the same time, the productivity gains of the Green Revolution are leveling off; the costs of using fossil fuels to transport fertilizer and food around the world are becoming prohibitive; and climate change will affect crop range and productivity in ways that are not yet predictable. To meet this new challenge, inexpensive and sustainable approaches will be necessary not only to improve food production of major commodity crops like wheat and rice, but also local crops and vegetables, especially in areas of massive global population expansion. The field of plant-microbe interactions has entered an era of particular promise and has the potential to provide innovative and highly adaptable approaches to increase plant productivity. Beneficial plant-Microbe interactions are known to improve plant resilience to many kinds of stresses, including disease, drought, salinity, nutrient limitation, and extreme temperature. Advances in the fundamental understanding of the natural relationships between plants and the microbial world can be put to immediate use to ensure sustainable food production worldwide. The time is especially ripe for an in-depth examination of the current state of the art in the study of microbe-plant interactions because scientific, technological, and computational advances of the last decade have opened avenues to address the complexity and dynamics of these interactions. The proposed colloquium is devoted specifically to develop novel integrated mechanisms that can lead to meaningful measures to enhance crop productivity and food security for the future. Broader impact The connection between greater fundamental understanding of plant-microbe interactions and the practical solution of enhanced crop productivity is compelling. Historically, the field has been hampered by the complexity and intractability of the biological system. The colloquium will bring together a diverse group of experts in the field who can identify the needs and challenges and develop a road map for rapid scientific progress and strategies to exploit the beneficial plant-microbe interactions, while curtailing those that are detrimental. Raising awareness of the potential of this field is likely to inspire young scientists to choose careers in basic science knowing that their contributions have positive impact on a number of societal grand challenges. Discussions at the colloquium will be captured in a report that will be freely available to the public. Also, a proposal has already been submitted for a session featuring colloquium participants at the 2013 AAAS meeting in Boston. The American Academy of Microbiology is committed to identifying opportunities like the AAAS meeting to disseminate the results of its colloquia to audiences beyond those of the participants and sponsors.

610,"Technical description.The biogeochemical cycling of iron in aqueous geochemical environments is intimately linked to the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, and strongly impacts the solubility and speciation of trace metals and metalloids in these systems. The research proposed here focuses on coupled Fe and trace metal cycling in riparian soils, which are located at the interface between dryland habitats and aquatic environments and play a key role in the transfer of nutrients and contaminants between upland and aquatic ecosystems. We observe the formation of layered Fe(II)-Al(III)-hydroxide minerals during reaction of aqueous Fe(II) with Al-oxide and clay mineral substrates under geochemical conditions common to submerged soils. We hypothesize that these previously unrecognized Fe(II) phases play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of Fe and trace metals in riparian environments. These secondary minerals form fast (on a time scale of hours in model systems, and within several days in experiments performed with wetland soil) and are therefore expected to be a major sink for Fe(II) released during reductive dissolution of Fe(III)-oxides. In addition, owing to small particle size, layered structure, and high Fe(II) content, these Fe(II) minerals are likely to be highly reactive towards redox-active contaminants such as Cr(VI) and may control retention of divalent metals such as Ni(II) and Zn(II) through adsorption and coprecipitation reactions. We hypothesize that the Fe(II)-Al(III)-hydroxide phases formed during initial reaction of Fe(II) with Al-bearing substrates are metastable transitional phases which over time will age into more crystalline Fe sorption products with reduced reactivity towards trace metal(loid)s. We will study the thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanistic aspects involved in the formation of these novel Fe(II) phases, and to characterize their structure and reactivity over a time span ranging from seconds to years. A suite of state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques, including Q-XAS, bulk XAS, and Mossbauer analyses, will be used to address these issues. This project will fill a major gap in our knowledge of Fe cycling in reducing and riparian environments, and will improve our understanding of contaminant fate and transport in these dynamic systems.Broader significance and importance.About 4-6% of the Earth's land surface is intermittently or permanently submerged. Soil flooding causes drastic changes in the chemistry of soil pore waters, driven mostly by microbial activity as soil microbes are forced to switch from using oxygen to alternative electron acceptors for respiration of organic carbon. Use of Fe(III)-oxide minerals in microbial respiration causes reductive dissolution of these minerals, which leads to the build-up of  high aqueous concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) and release of toxic metal(loid) impurities associated with the Fe(III)-oxide minerals. The research addresses the fate of Fe(II) and metalloid pollutants released to solution during flooding. We have identified a previously unknown precipitation mechanism which may repartition released Fe(II) and trace metals back to the solid phase. The precipitation process is activated by reaction of dissolved Fe(II) with Al-bearing soil minerals causing precipitation of secondary Fe(II)-Al(III)-hydroxide minerals. Precipitation of these new Fe(II) phases occurs rapidly and extensively under conditions typical of flooded soils, and is therefore likely to be an important process governing the fate of released Fe(II) in these systems. Formation of the Fe(II) minerals removes toxic metals from solution as well as metals are incorporated into the structure or adsorb onto the surface of the new phases. The research proposed here will characterize the main geochemical parameters controlling the formation and reactivity of these Fe(II) phases in flooded soils, and provide quantitative thermodynamic data allowing for prediction of their occurrence in natural systems. The results of this project will fill a major gap in our understanding of the geochemical processes controlling soil and water quality in riparian systems, which includes environments as diverse as polar bogs and fens, tropical swamps, coastal and freshwater wetlands, paddy rice fields, and floodplain soils. The work is of importance in assessing the restoration of former wetlands (through re-establishment of riparian conditions) as a management option for floodwater control and restoration of biodiversity at sites where (re)mobilization of previously accumulated pollutants is a concern.

612,"This action funds a National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2012. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow to focus their studies in plant genomics with an emphasis on quantitative genetics, modern breeding approaches, and bioinformatics. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Rachel S. Meyer is  Selection for Salt Tolerance in African Rice (Oryza Glaberrima) in Indigenous Riverine Agricultural Habitats of Western Africa .  The host institution for the fellowship is New York University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Michael Purugganan.  One major factor limiting worldwide crop production is high salinity, which affects 50% of global irrigated land area. Farmers in the Atlantic Coast region stretching from Senegal to Liberia plant indigenous crops that are tolerant to saline conditions.  This project focuses on one such crop that is a major staple: African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.). O. glaberrima is irrigated by rivers with a conspicuous salinity gradient. Thus, the agricultural system developed for O. glaberrima implies that varieties have been arranged with matched fitness to local saline levels. However, farmers also practice agriculture in unique ways including dyking of mangrove swamps, soil overturning, and sometimes desalination, which spurs several critical questions. How has the O. glaberrima genome been modified to tolerate salinity? To what extent do specific agricultural practices play a role in the ability of O. glaberrima to be cultivated in saline environments? Is it geographic characteristics or cultural practices that guide selection for this crop?  To address these questions, the genomes of 100 germplasm accessions from three agricultural river systems will be surveyed in order to build a SNP map for O. glaberrima and identify DNA regions that distinguish germplasm from saline coastal versus freshwater inland environments. Interviews will be conducted to gather information about land conditions, farming techniques, and community roles in seed trading along these rivers. DNA sequence data will be correlated with the salinity at collection locales, culturally specific agricultural practices, and salt injury tests. Results will connect aspects of human innovation to agroecology and selective crop breeding, while specifically addressing challenges faced by a need to practice agriculture on areas of high salinity. Training objectives include data management of entire genomes and population analyses, in-depth agroecological analysis, and cross-training between NYU and international institutions.

613,"The Fall 2012 meeting of the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference will be at Rice University on November 9-11, 2012.  The conference will be focused on the moduli space of curves, broadly defined to include Teichmuller theory, cohomological topics surrounding the Mumford conjecture (Madsen-Weiss theorem) and the tautological ring, the mapping class group, and other related topics in algebraic geometry and geometric topology.  The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 47 times.  The conference has become an extremely successful semi-annual event in the Southwest.  The next series of conferences will have seven primary sponsoring universities:  Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Houston, Texas Tech University, Texas Christian University/University of Texas at Arlington (jointly).  The conference is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the active community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states.  The conference is committed to bring researchers of national  and international stature to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states.  Summaries of talks with notation of important results are publicly reported.By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci.  First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding  states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates  productive cooperative efforts between schools.  Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.  In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees.  Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support.  Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a pilot project to foster research opportunities for junior faculty.The permanent web page for the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference is here: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~tgtc/archive/.

615,"This project will examine the uncertainties in the magnetospheric cross polar cap potential (CPCP) and in the plasma sheet population and how these uncertainties affect the intensity and spatial distribution of the magnetospheric ring current during magnetic storms. It will examine how much of the disagreements between models and observations of the ring can be attributed to the uncertainty in the boundary conditions rather than other causes such as missing physical processes in the models. Previous simulation studies have shown that changes in the magnetospheric convection electric field and the plasma sheet distribution, which is the major source to the ring current, strongly influence the ring current. For this reason, success in modeling common ring current observables, such as the Dst index, ground magnetic perturbations and magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit, and plasma parameters is dependent on knowing the CPCP and the plasma sheet densities and temperatures. Because of limited spatial and temporal resolution of in-situ measurements of such quantities, averages from statistical re-analysis or empirical models are often used to specify the boundary conditions for inner magnetospheric models. However, there are large uncertainties associated with these boundary condition specifications. This project will quantify how sensitive simulated storms are to the uncertainties in the CPCP and in the ion and electron plasma sheet density and temperature boundary conditions of self-consistent inner magnetospheric models. The approach is to investigate the statistical variations of plasma sheet parameters measured by the NASA THEMIS spacecraft and the CPCP from DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) measurements relative to reference models commonly used to provide simulation boundary conditions. For these data sets, a statistical model of the residual errors of reference models for CPCP and central plasma sheet parameters will be developed. The multivariate error covariance statistics will be computed and Monte Carlo scenarios of the plasma and electric field boundary conditions will be generated. In some cases, the Monte Carlo scenarios will be constrained by available in-situ data. For the different boundary conditions scenarios, the magnetically and electrically self-consistent Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E) will be used to simulate Dst, ground magnetic perturbations and magnetic field and plasma parameters at geosynchronous orbit. By comparing the metrics for the different boundary condition scenarios, the project will determine whether the RCM-E is physically sufficient given the uncertainties in the boundary conditions, or whether it needs additional physical processes.This project will help determine whether researchers need to continue to focus on adding more realistic physics to models of the ring current or if they should shift their focus toward improving the specification of the boundary conditions the control the models. Ultimately it will pave the way to generating ensemble space weather nowcasts and forecasts of the inner magnetosphere's plasma and fields.  The project is headed by a woman scientist and also involves research ties between industry (Aerospace Corp.) and universities.

616,"Fungal pathogens of plants cause tremendous yield losses in crop production worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen interference with host defenses have been gradually elucidated for plant bacterial and oomycete pathogens. However, these mechanisms are still poorly understood for fungal pathogens. Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is the most devastating disease of rice. It serves as an advanced model pathosystem for researchers who study plant-fungal interactions in cereal crops. M. oryzae introduces an effector protein called AvrPiz-t into its host, where it causes widespread changes in immune function. This effector is noteworthy for attacking two components of plant immunity, the reaction to conserved molecular patterns of the pathogen (PAMP-triggered immunity or PTI) and strain-specific immune responses to pathogens (effector-triggered immunity or ETI). Preliminary results indicate that AvrPiz-t represents a novel fungal effector that interacts with the host?s ubiquitination system for both its virulence and immunity inducing activities. In particular, it interacts with three rice enzymes called ubiquitin E3 ligases to suppress their ligase activity and thereby reduce the effectiveness of the host's immune response. The immunosuppressive activity of the pathogen is countered by these same E3 ligases, which ubiquitinate AvrPiz-t to mark it for degradation. This project seeks to understand at the molecular level how AvrPiz-t interacts with host proteins to suppress the host's innate immunity. The specific goals are: (1) Determine the interference, degradation, ubiquitination and PTI suppression mechanisms of AvrPiz-t; (2) Identify the function of an E3 ligase in the regulation of PTI and ETI; and (3) Use genetic and biochemical approaches to gain insight into the relationship between this E3 ligase and the resistance protein that mediates the immune response induced by AvrPiz-t. The project will potentially provide new insights into fungal disease control in rice and other cereal crops. As the staple food for nearly 50% of the world's population, development of new rice blast control strategies from this project will affect food security and social stability in many developing countries. Moreover, this project will provide extensive training opportunities for a postdoctoral fellow and a PhD student who might continue to work on this important disease in the future.

617,"Stanford University doctoral student Jenna Rice, with direction from Dr. Sylvia J. Yanagisako, will undertake research on the relationship between globalization and local practices of charitable giving. Over the past three decades, there has been a significant worldwide growth of philanthropic foundations, which are shaped by global economic and political processes. But at the local level, giving is also affected by particulars of social structure, community identity, and understandings of civic responsibility. This research will examine the interface between the locally germane prescriptive pressure people may feel to give for religious and political reasons, and international discourses of charity, philanthropy, and international finance.The research will be carried out in Sidon, Lebanon. Lebanon is an appropriate site for this research because sectarian charitable foundations have become increasingly responsible for the provisioning of basic social services. This expansion of politically and religiously motivated sectarian charities will be compared to long-standard neighborhood practices of giving. Research methods will include archival research; intensive observation of a sample of households, stratified by members' age and generation; semi-structured interviews; and media and discourse analysis of the representation and treatment of poverty and charity in popular media.This research is important because it contributes to social science theory of the relationship between international political and economic forces and local sectarian processes of resource pooling and reallocation through charitable giving. Funding this research also supports the education of a social scientist.

618,"Reflecting the rising global food security challenges, over 60% of the East African population is considered malnourished with many regions in a state of famine. There is broad agreement on the need to help small-scale farmers move from subsistence to sustainability by boosting their agricultural productivity, reducing spoilage and providing market linkages. Greenhouses allow farmers to grow vegetables and fruits year-round through mechanically controlled temperature and irrigation systems. Greenhouses can help farmers increase their yields and improve their livelihoods while reducing spoilage and furthering food security. With 80% of land area classified as arid or semi-arid, and 3% of land under forest cover, only 17% of land is cultivable in Kenya. Out of this, only 52% is actually cultivated. In the arid and semi-arid regions, access to water is a significant problem that is further compounded by evapotranspiration, or water losses from crops exposed to the environment, resulting in an increase in the total water demand for crop production. Greenhouses effectively reduce evapotranspiration by 30% when compared to open-field conditions, and the water use per unit yield can be lowered by up to 50% by the usage of a controlled irrigation system inside the greenhouse. Imported greenhouses sold in East Africa are designed for large commercial farms. They are too expensive ($2,000+) for small-scale farmers and do not meet their needs and use preferences.Our team is collaborating with diverse Kenyan and Tanzanian organizations to design, prototype, and field-test affordable greenhouses designed for small agro-enterprises and sustenance farmers. The basic hypothesis is that growing fruits and vegetables in the affordable greenhouses will help regions with cold climates and arid / semi-arid climates to grow food for their local needs while reducing cost and environmental impacts. This model of improved local food production has a longer growing season and provides steady year-round employment while greatly reducing water, nutrient, land and transportation energy requirements. This significantly reduced water budget for agricultural production directly results in more food, improved livelihoods and food security, while furthering sustainability. Our technological innovation is design for extreme affordability and sustainability. The greenhouses will be designed to be manufactured for less than $450 and reduce water usage by at least 30%.The specific goal of the proposed one-year project was to complete the design, feasibility analysis and impact assessment of a pilot low-cost greenhouse. With funding support from the EPA P3 program, our team intended to:Develop and refine the greenhouse technology in preparation for demonstration and dissemination through a network of distributed micro-enterprises. The focus will be on design for easy assembly and researching low-cost substitutes for greenhouse-grade plastics. Specifically, we will be researching the feasibility of rice bags as an extremely low-cost substitute for greenhouse-grade plastic.Develop and host a series of hands-on workshops and resources for entrepreneurs, educators and community development professionals on affordable greenhouse construction and greenhouse economics.Lay the foundation for a greenhouse entrepreneurial eco-system that connects entrepreneurs, educators, independent sales agents, non-profits, industry partners, government agencies, UN agencies and other players to discuss and address relevant issues. This will be a virtual network that convenes on a frequent basis.

621,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Introduction: Despite an information explosion about antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in bacteria, patients are dying of untreatable infections for the first time since antibiotics were discovered. The main cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in gram-negative bacteria is active efflux of drug by bacterial pumps. Knowing how the pumps are regulated is the key to understanding MDR development: bacteria can become MDR simply by increasing expression of these efflux pumps. Significance: Bacteroides fragilis are ubiquitous gut commensals that cause devastating disease when they escape the gut; their resistance to antimicrobials is rising significantly. In aerobes, MDR is caused by efflux pumps regulated by transcription factors (TFs). We hypothesize that MDR efflux pumps in B. fragilis are similarly regulated by TFs. These TFs, and the pumps they regulate, may also regulate other virulence factors. VA patients are particularly at risk for anaerobic infections. Mortality in Bacteroides bacteremia is high (25- 50%) and liver disease, common in VA patients, is a risk factor for increased mortality. We identified several MDR clinical isolates (including one from a GI in Afghanistan) with increased pump activity; these isolates were resistant to metronidazole and other agents and resulted in one death and one amputation, respectively. Preliminary Studies: In the previous funding period, we identified and characterized the B. fragilis bme efflux pump genes and showed that they were implicated in clinical MDR (described in 23 publications); we found that increases in pump levels and in resistance could be induced by a variety of agents and stressors including antimicrobials, salicylate, bile and quorum sensing molecules. We constructed new vectors and modified them to mimic the molecular tools available for use with aerobes. Research Plan: Our long term goal is to unravel the complex regulation of MDR in B. fragilis. Specifically, our goals now are to: AIM 1: Identify the TFs most important in efflux-mediated MDR (both activator and repressor TFs) using a functional genomic approach. AIM 2: Characterize TFs most important in efflux-mediated MDR. Determine the phenotype associated with the TF, measure MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) and determine the relevant bme genes. Demonstrate binding by physical and functional approaches. AIM 3: Determine the clinical prevalence of TF regulation in efflux mediated MDR. Measure TF transcription levels in clinical isolates, including the recently acquired MDR strains. Determine the effect of TF on efflux-mediated MDR and on ability to form biofilms. Assess the effect of bile exposure on TF transcription levels, MICs and biofilm forming ability. This study takes advantage of our unique resources: expertise with molecular and biochemical approaches, access to a massive collection of clinical isolates and associated MIC data, and excellent collaborative relationships with world-class experts. Once completed, this work, together with the studies already conducted, will reveal important new information about regulation of BF MDR pumps and will greatly contribute to our knowledge of regulation mechanisms in this bacterium that is subject to very different stresses than aerobic pathogens. B. fragilis is an important component of the gut microbiome (which has been called a separate  organ  within the human body) that is recognized as having its own impressive metabolic profile and profoundly affects almost every aspect of human health and disease. In this global environment, there is little time from the emergence of the first MDR strains to widespread resistance. Racing to develop effective drugs when untreatable infections emerge is not a viable public health strategy. Regulators of MDR efflux are important targets in drug discovery; identifying and understanding the TFs that are most important in these MDR organisms will lead to the development of new and effective interventional therapies that target the expression or translation of these factors.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Rising antimicrobial resistance costs 5-30 billion dollars and 90,000 lives in the US alone! Multi-drug efflux pumps are largely responsible for this resistance. Bacteroides fragilis is an important member of the gut microbiota that has critical roles in human health and disease. We have virtually no information about these pumps or their regulation in this important anaerobic pathogen. abdominal wall; Accounting; Address; adverse outcome; Aerobic; Aerobic Bacteria; Affect; Afghanistan; Amputation; Anaerobic Bacteria; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotics; Anti-Infective Agents; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Antimicrobial Resistance; Area; Attention; Bacteremia; Bacteria; Bacterial Genome; Bacterial Infections; bacterial resistance; Bacteroides; Bacteroides fragilis; Bile fluid; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; biological research; Biology; Businesses; capsule; Cessation of life; Chronic; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Code; Collection; Colon; combat; Communities; Complex; Consensus; cost; Data; design; Development; Disease; drug development; drug discovery; Drug Efflux; Drug resistance; efflux pump; Elements; Environment; Escherichia coli; Explosion; Face; Family; Foundations; Frequencies; functional genomics; Funding; Funding Agency; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic Transcription; genome sequencing; global environment; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; gut microbiota; Health; Healthcare; Homologous Gene; Human; Human body; Individual; Industry; Infection; information gathering; inhibitor/antagonist; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Liver diseases; Measures; Mediating; Medical center; member; Membrane; Metabolic; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Metronidazole resistance; Microbial Biofilms; microbiome; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multi-Drug Resistance; mutant; Nosocomial Infections; One-Step dentin bonding system; Operon; Organ; Organism; Outcome; Outcome Study; Outcomes Research; overexpression; Oxygen; pathogen; pathogenic bacteria; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Phenotype; Predisposition; Prevalence; Probability; Public Health; public health relevance; Publications; Published Comment; Pump; quorum sensing; Race; Regimen; Regulation; Regulon; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Resistance; Resistance development; resistance mechanism; resistant strain; Resources; response; Rice; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; salicylate; Scientist; sensor; Solid; Stress; stressor; Surface; System; Therapeutic; Time; tool; transcription factor; Transcription factor genes; translation factor; Up-Regulation; vector; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Virulent; WorkREGULATION OF BACTEROIDES FRAGILIS MULTIDRUG EFFLUX PUMPS",0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06
622,"Plant genetic transformation is routinely used in plant research laboratories for functional genomic analyses. The technology has enabled dramatic improvements in agronomic performance of major food crops grown on millions of acres around the world. Common bean - a most important source of dietary protein for human consumption globally - cannot be transformed routinely using current approaches. Coupled with the genome sequence, an efficient transformation system will accelerate genomic approaches to improve this important crop. Our goal is to establish a reproducible transformation protocol for common bean using Agrobacterium-mediated method. Our hypothesis is that half seeds or cotyledonary nodes of common bean can be used as target explants for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and organogenesis for regeneration. We will focus our efforts on Agrobacterium-mediated method as transgenic events generated by this method usually provide low transgene insertion in the genome, which is more desirable for researchers. Iowa State University's Center for Plant Transformation has extensive experience providing genetic transformation services (corn, soybean, rice and Brachypodium) to public researchers around the world. We expect to develop a robust and publicly-available bean transformation technology. This new technology will accelerate gene discovery, marker development, and identification of new traits in a crop that has been extremely difficult to improve using standard breeding approaches.

623,"Organic rice farming may have greater potential for soil carbon (C) sequestration, but may also result in greater greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of greater input of organic matter (C is a main component) compared to conventional rice production. Our project will integrate the use of cover crops, organic soil amendments, and choice of cultivar to improve soil quality, reduce losses from disease and increase yield and milling quality. This proposed research will also utilize life cycle assessment (LCA) to help optimize environmental services and the climate change mitigation capability of organic rice farming systems. In previous independent studies to develop management practices for organic rice farming, we demonstrated: 1) ryegrass and clover had better performance than other winter cover crops on clay soil; 2) two organic soil amendments, Nature Safe and Rhizogen, significantly increased rice yield and milling quality over other organic fertilizers; and 3) cultivar significantly affected the yield of organically produced rice. Information is lacking on the integrated effects of these organic rice production practices and their economic and ecological benefits. To accomplish our goals, we will quantify the effects of cover crops, organic soil amendments, and cultivar on rice yield, milling quality, soil quality, soil C sequestration, and GHG emissions in integrated studies conducted in Texas. We conducted a stakeholder survey to prioritize research goals and consulted with an established advisory committee involving growers, millers, consultants, and end-users to guide our research approach and delineate technology transfer programs needed to implement these organic rice systems.

624,"Straighthead is a physiological disorder and the most damaging non-fungal disease in rice. Grain yield can be totally lost from straighthead. This occurs every year with an increasing frequency in Arkansas where about 50% of US rice is produced. The exact cause of straighthead is unknown. The current management to prevent straighthead is draining fields about 2 weeks after a permanent flood, drying the soil until rice leaves exhibit drought stress symptoms, and then re-flooding the field. The draining wasted 151 million m3 water and the re-flooding cost $ 7.443 million in 2009. The symptoms of arsenic (As) injury to rice are similar to straighthead. Therefore, incorporation of As in the form of monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA) has become the only method of evaluating rice susceptibility to straighthead for new cultivars in the Uniform Rice Regional Nursery (URRN) jointly in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. Evaluation based on the MSMA amendment must be abandoned sooner or later because of the pollution to soil and grand water. Therefore, a natural site for straighthead evaluation is essential for the rice states. The discovery of a natural site at the UAPB farm has set a solid foundation for this project, and such a site has never been reported anywhere else. Comparative study of straighthead between the natural and simulated sites would be more effective to elucidate the attributive factors than previous studies. Straighthead information from the natural site should be more applicable to farmer fields than that obtained from the simulated site through soil amendment with MSMA. Establishment of a natural site for straighthead evaluation will serve national rice breeders for germplasm selection and cultivar improvement in the URRN system. Completion of this project will result in: 1) An upgraded lab for agronomic research and education at UAPB; 2) Establishment of a natural site for straighthead evaluation; 3) Well-trained personnel. The upgraded agronomy lab will be an important achievement because it will allow UAPB to develop an excellent straighthead research center after this project. The lab will be used for research and student training, especially graduate student training. After completion of this project, straighthead evaluation in the URRN could be conducted in the newly established UAPB natural site. UAPB will build a professional tie with those states where they current evaluate straighthead in URRN, and the tie will broaden UAPB's capacity in agriculture for future research endeavors and education. The upgraded lab will enhance UAPB capacity to develop a research analysis center for straighthead and related problems, and increase the capacity for UAPB to do further research of soil and crop beyond this project. Through the collaboration with Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center where both personnel and resources are on the top of national or even international level of rice research, the UAPB capabilities on both research and teaching could be effectively advanced. The proposed project will build capacity to increase UAPB's ability to conduct similar or new research activities afterwards.

625,"Rice cultivation under continuously flooded paddies is no longer sustainable in the USA and abroad due to dwindling water resources in the face of climate change. The technology to improve water use efficiency for rice cultivation exists, yet farmers' willingness to change cultivation methods represents a significant barrier to success. This project provides information on the nutritional content of rice grain grown using less irrigation water. Aquaporins are channel proteins belonging to the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family, which modulate the bidirectional flux of water and small neutral molecules across cellular membranes. Arsenite and selenite are transported through rice roots via specific aquaporins, while inorganic mercury(II) is an aquaporin inhibitor, binding to specific cysteine residues and blocking entry in cells. Cultivating rice using less water will likely alter the transcription abundance of aquaporins, which in turn will alter the accumulation of arsenic, selenium, and mercury species, possibly improving nutrient content in rice grain. Results will increase knowledge on the nutritional content of rice grown using less water, and will help promote wider acceptance of water-saving rice cultivation methods.

628,"Burkholderia glumae is the major causative agent of bacterial panicle blight of rice and is becoming an increasingly important pathogen worldwide. Bacterial panicle blight can cause severe yield losses in rice and is recognized as an important disease of rice. Despite the increasing importance of this disease and pathogen, how B. glumae is able to cause disease is not completely understood. One of the major virulence factors of B. glumae is toxoflavin, a phytotoxin produced by the pathogen. In a previous genetic study, a novel gene that controls toxoflavin production in B. glumae was identified. Mutants that were defective in this gene were generated in the same study. This project will use various molecular laboratory techniques and assay tools to characterize the function of this novel regulatory gene that determines the virulence of B. glumae. Experimental results will provide a better understanding of the global regulatory network underlying the virulence of B. glumae. This information will ultimately lead to the development of effective disease control strategies.

629,"Xanthomonas bacteria are the causal agents of disease of major crop plants worldwide, including rice, tomato, pepper, citrus, banana, cassava, sugarcane, and crucifers. Xanthomonas infection can be especially damaging in developing countries that rely heavily on staple crops like rice and cassava, but it also has severe consequences for farmers in the United States. I study Xanthomonas campestris vesicatoria (Xcv), the causal agent of bacterial spot disease in tomato. Xcv colonizes tomato leaves and fruit during infection and negatively affects tomato quality and crop yield worldwide. Like many bacterial pathogens of plants and animals, Xcv can inject proteins (called type III secretion effectors, or T3Es) directly into host cells during infection. A major problem scientists face in improving plant health is a limited knowledge of the biochemical details of immune signaling and plant defense in important crop plants. My long-term goals are (1) to elucidate the plant cellular signaling networks that regulate immunity to microbial pathogens in important crops and (2) to determine how bacterial pathogens use T3Es to suppress immunity and cause disease. Achieving these goals is essential in order to engineer more robust and healthy crops. To work toward these goals, this project specifically will identify unknown components of the cellular immune signaling network in tomato that are targeted by Xcv during infection and will determine how the novel, broadly conserved Xanthomonas T3E, XopX, contributes to Xcv pathogenesis. Identifying the biochemical activity of Xcv T3Es in plant cells will help scientists understand and combat plant disease. Tomato is part of the plant family Solanaceae, one of the most valuable crop families in the world. In addition to being a representative crop species, there are many molecular and genetic tools that make tomato an excellent model for study in the laboratory, including a fully sequenced genome, high genotypic diversity from a number of cultivated and wild accessions, and amenability to genetic manipulation through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. These tools make tomato an excellent plant to study the molecular and genetic basis of plant immunity in valuable crops.

630,"Potatoes are the fourth most-consumed food crop in the world, after rice, wheat, and corn, and the leading vegetable crop in the US. Roughly four-fifths of the harvested potato crop is sold for fresh or processed consumption. Processed potatoes comprise 58 percent of total US potato utilization; from the average of 129 pounds consumed per capita per year, 55 pounds are frozen potatoes, 43 pounds fresh potatoes, 17 pounds are potato chips, and 14 pounds are dehydrated products. Potato production in the US is being challenged by the introduction of this devastating new disease. Zebra Chip produces a characteristic striped pattern of necrosis in affected potato tubers, which appear as burned striations when they are fried as chips. Zebra Chip results in a severe reduction in the productivity of a field, reduced storage life, and rejection of the crop by the processing industry.The results and information acquired from this project will be dispersed to key personnel in the potato industry including growers, universities, government agencies and end-users. The majority of US potato growers farm less than 100 acres, yielding less than $200,000 in yearly farm income. Successful completion of this project will provide potato growers with a valuable tool for managing potato psyllid to reduce the risk of spreading ZC.

631,"Rice blast disease is one of the most serious disease problems facing rice production in the world. Magnaporthe oryzae, is the fungal pathogen that causes rice blast. The M. oryzae-Rice pathosystem is an important model system and the biology of the fungus has been examined in great detail. Resistance genes in rice are known to be receptors that detect virulence factors and trigger defense against the pathogen. This system places selective pressure on the pathogen that may lead to gene duplication and diversification of pathogen virulence factors. This produces a set of related genes in the fungal genome called gene families. If these diversified members have virulence function, the loss of any one family member may not have a large impact on the pathogen. This allows individual fungal isolates within the pathogen population to mutate or eliminate genes that are recognized by resistance genes, while retaining other family members to carry out the virulence function. Clearly, pathogen genes that display rapid evolution are excellent candidates for virulence genes. This project will examine one such gene family. Understanding the role of this gene family will allow development of new resistance strategies by either helping to identify existing resistance genes in rice or related grass species, or by providing the tools to engineer new resistance genes that recognize members of this gene family.

632,"This project will investigate two types of effectors, one internal and the other external, that have the potential to have a significant impact on agricultural yields. The internal effector is the embryo sac, a critical unit of plant reproduction within the female organs of the flower, which governs the formation of the seed. The genetic mechanism by which rice plants specify their female gametes (egg cell and central cell) inside the embryo sac will be deciphered using rice plants. The female gametes give rise to the two major components of the seed, the embryo and the endosperm. Genes that control embryo sac development can be used to facilitate production of hybrid seed, and for improving seed size and seed production, which is of agricultural importance to rice and other seed crops. An external effector that can impact yields is the soil microbiome, i.e. the community of microbes in association with the roots of field grown plants, which provides benefits to crops through processes such as conversion of ammonia to nitrate, and protection against pathogens. The project will determine the effects of the soil microbiome on gene expression in rice, to provide an understanding of how the plant metagenome (the composite genomes of the associated microbiome) interacts with the plant genome. Such knowledge can be exploited to select for genes/traits that favor the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppress the growth of harmful bacteria. Utilizing the natural alliances between plants and microbes can lead to an entirely new direction in plant breeding for the future of agriculture.

634,"Plants are constantly exposed to all sorts of environmental stresses, insects, and microbes that cause disease. In order to ensure a healthy and plentiful food supply, it is critical that we understand the natural means which plants use to protect themselves and thereby ultimately produce food and fiber for humans to use. This project is designed to identify some of the natural genetic and biochemical mechanisms that are important for plant defense. We will measure how the expression patterns of some genes change after plants are exposed to stresses, such as high salt, high temperature, and insect pests. This information should aid us in developing molecular markers, based on DNA sequences, that will be useful for plant breeders who are actively developing improved crop varieties. We will use sensitive techniques for measuring the levels of specific plant compounds, which have been suggested as perhaps important in defense against pests. In addition to these DNA-based molecular techniques, and the analytical chemistry techniques, we will take advantage of the spectrum of genetic diversity among plants by screening multiple varieties of plants for their growth performance when they are subjected various stresses. Much of our work on environmental stress will focus on crops that are important throughout the U.S., such as soybean and rice. Our project on defensive compounds will be centered on a legume plant called Medicago truncatula. This plant species is useful because it has a broad genetic background, it is a legume that requires very little nitrogen for growth, and because it produces a broad array of complex anti-microbial and anti-insect compounds. Our ultimate goals in this work are to be able to apply the information gained to use the naturally occurring plant-defense mechanisms to produce improved crop varieties. Ultimately, this would result in a better understanding of plant biology and potentially in a reduced need for chemical pesticides. As many farmers need to increasingly contend with higher levels of salt in their soils and with increased air temperatures, it will become more important that we develop plants that are able to survive in harsh conditions.

We will elucidate E. phyllopogon seed responses to temperature, water and oxygen availability and better understand differences between resistant and susceptible biotypes for germinating and emerging in rice fields in order to maximize the efficacy of the glyphosate-based stale seedbed technique to control herbicide resistant Echinochloa spp. The deployment of herbicide-resistant crops, or the frequent use of glyphosate, in non-rice fields adjacent to rice fields can aggravate the herbicide resistance scenario. Thus certain potential weeds of rice are being selected in non-rice areas for resistance to certain herbicides that are essential for the pre plant control of multiple herbicide-resistant weed of rice.

Almost everyone knows that carrots are good for them because they have an orange pigment (beta-carotene) that is converted to vitamin A, and that eating coloured vegetables is thought to protect against cancer. beta-Carotene, especially at large amounts, can also be converted into molecules that are called beta-apocarotenoids. Our work shows that these molecules can antagonize the normal function of vitamin A. This may account for the unexpected and negative effects of large doses of beta-carotene used in human clinical trials aimed at reducing the incidence of cancer. These findings may also have implications for attempts to alleviate vitamin A deficiency by the creation of staple crops with high levels of beta-carotene (e.g. golden rice).

637,"Rice is an important crop and one of great economic importance in many U.S. regions, especially the southern states and California. Three to four million acres of rice are planted annually in the U.S. with about 600,000 acres grown in California. California is the nation's second largest rice producing state, with 2010 production totaling nearly 4.5 billion pounds contributing about $1.8 billion dollars to the local economies. Rice is staple crop for half of the world's people, and 40 percent of the California rice crop is exported. Ensuring good rice harvests therefore promotes economic stability and food security at home and abroad. Rice production creates temporary wetlands which has definite positive benefits as well as potential drawbacks in California. For instance, California ricelands are used by 230 wildlife species, providing nearly 60 percent of the food for 7 to 10 million wintering ducks and geese in the Central Valley with an estimated $1.5 billion in habitat value. However, on the negative side, the aquatic nature of ricelands pose the greatest challenge for mosquito control districts in many rural areas. Riceland mosquitoes can transmit a variety of endemic and potentially invasive diseases that threaten the health of humans, livestock, and wildlife in rural areas (West Nile Virus being a recent example). Therefore, the challenge is to produce rice in an environmentally and economically viable way that will maximize grain production while minimizing populations of mosquitoes. The rice crop is under continual threat from resident and invasive arthropod pests. Crop losses due to arthropod pests can range up to 30 percent. Without scientific research on how to control these pests, growers could be faced with serious economic losses. In addition to pests that cause crop damage, there are serious issues with disease-bearing insects emanating from rice fields; species of mosquitoes found in rice fields are some of the most efficient vectors of West Nile Virus, St. Louis Encephalitis virus, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus. Thus, it is imperative to perform research that identifies effective, safe, and economical integrated pest management programs for crop pests and mosquitoes in rice fields.

638,"Nitrogen fertilizer must be used efficiently in rice production because it is the most expensive input a rice farmer makes, it has such a major impact on rice yields, and if it escapes into the surrounding environment can cause great harm. Thus, we must study the fate of nitrogen in rice production so we can use it correctly and efficiently. Several possible ways to improve nitrogen fertilizer efficiency in rice production would be to: i) minimize ammonia volatilization loss of the preflood nitrogen; ii) develop a nitrogen soil test so the nitrogen applied to rice is more accurate; iii) determine the extent the midseason nitrogen influences the grain yield of the currently grown rice varieties and the proper time to apply the midseason nitrogen fertilizer; and iv) investigate and understand the nutrient utilization efficiency of the new high yielding hybrid rice varieties in comparison to the conventionally bred varieties and what differences if any exist between these two rice types. Nitrous oxide and methane are potent greenhouse gases with global warming potentials approximately 310 and 23 times greater than carbon dioxide, respectively. Rice is the only staple crop with a major portion of its growing season under flooded soil conditions. This makes rice production uniquely susceptible to nitrous oxide loss by denitrification and methane emissions via methanogenesis. Thus, concerns of the role of rice production have necessitated further investigation of emissions particularly in regions such as Arkansas where highly mechanized production practices are utilized and no known research is currently available.

639,"Our current ignorance of most of the mechanisms involved in plant iron homeostasis is a major obstacle in devising approaches for biofortification of staple foods with iron. Biofortification refers to the genetic engineering of staple crops to accumulate additional bioavailable iron in edible parts, and is widely regarded as a sustainable means of improving the iron nutrition of the 2-3 billion people worldwide (World Health Organization; http://www.who.int/nut/ida.htm) whose inadequate diet causes iron deficiency anemia. Understanding these transport mechanisms is the key to allowing enhanced seed iron accumulation through either engineering or through marker assisted breeding efforts. Improving our understanding of plant iron homeostatic mechanisms is also critical if we wish to improve growth of crops in marginal soils, where iron deficiency frequently limits crop growth. This problem is of particular concern for growth of upland rice (i.e., non-paddy rice), which is an increasingly important crop in Asia as water resources become more limited. It is also a growing problem in the North American soybean crop, as soy production moves into less favorable northern latitudes. Plant's efficient use of iron within tissues is a promising target to address these issues, provided that additional information about such mechanisms becomes available. By carefully characterizing the Yellow Stripe-Like (YSL) transporter family in corn, we will gain much needed insight into the molecular mechanisms that this important crop species uses to maintain proper iron homeostasis. Even more importantly, the detailed molecular information that will be obtained will suggest strategies that can be used to alter the pattern of iron distribution in corn, and will thus aid in the development of novel strategies to achieve iron biofortification.

In order to continue developing rice cultivars for Arkansas that are improved over those being currently grown, the rice breeding program in Arkansas must remain viable. Although the rice cultivars presently grown in Arkansas are classed as improved cultivars, there is still room for improvement of certain characteristics desired by growers and processors and for the development of specialty rices. Transferring desirable characters into rice is a laborious process especially if introduced from wild germplasm sources that have traits for both agronomic and quality characteristics considered undesirable in cultivated species and which are controlled by dominant genes.

641,"Volatility in commodity markets affects all actors in the food system. Developing countries in Asia are particularly vulnerable to increased price volatility in rice, which is the staple food in the region and accounts for a large proportion of consumer income and expenditures. A lack of market-based tools, such as futures and options markets in Asian countries make the issue of increased volatility even more problematic. An objective of this proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility of developing and introducing a variety of market-based risk management tools for this region. Accomplishing the objectives of this project will provide a better understanding of commodity price volatility. This research effort will help guide academiciansAE future research efforts in this field and will enhance the ability of US and developing countriesAE farmers and agribusinesses to understand, manage, and forecast marketplace volatility. Given increased market volatility faced by agribusinesses, it is of prime importance to gain more understanding about the relative cost associated with options hedging. The cost of hedging using out-of-the money options is an implicit artifact of volatility skew patterns. Thus a natural question to be addressed is: do hedging pressures in commodity options markets, which may be related to industry concentration characteristics, induce more expensive risk management strategies for certain market participants For example, Thomsen and Mckenzie (2010) provide systematic evidence that buying out-of-the money live cattle puts is an expensive risk management strategy. In other words, real world put options prices are relatively more expensive than would be consistent with theoretical options pricing models. Another trend is increasing globalization and corresponding changes in domestic policy. Over the last decade a combination of greater liberalization of international trade policy and reduced US government intervention in commodity markets has propelled the US grain and oilseeds industries into a more market-oriented economic environment. Thus globalization can be seen as a driving force behind greater price risk and increased competition that is now facing US agriculture. A major advantage that US agriculture has over foreign competition is ease of access to developed commodity risk management markets. In order to remain competitive, US agribusinesses increasingly rely on options markets, which developed alongside the futures markets, to provide a cost-effective yet profitable service to market participants throughout the world. In addition to providing important business and marketing tools, options facilitate the price discovery process by serving as important benchmarks in negotiations between buyers and sellers. This role is central to the long-term efficiency and viability of US agriculture and an understanding of the behavior of these markets and how they have changed over time is crucial to decision makers in government, industry, and on the farm.

644,"Pumpkins are relatively large, 'bulky' vegetables in which the waste or inedible parts are eliminated through minimal processing. This provides convenience to the consumer. Tropical pumpkin is used as an important ingredient in the main dish of Puerto Rico: rice and beans. Pumpkin is added to the beans to enhance appearance, flavor and nutritional value. We propose to study packaged pumpkin under various storage temperatures, verify if minimally processed pumpkin maintains its physical, chemical, physicochemical, qualitative characteristics and conduct sensory analyses after minimal processing. We propose to compare the nutritional composition of this dish prepared with fresh versus minimally processed pumpkin pieces. Minimally processed pumpkin has considerable potential to create new value-added market opportunities in Puerto Rico.

646,"Nanoscale science, engineering and technology (nanotechnology) have great potential for application to the food and agricultural system. The novel physical, chemical, and biological properties of systems with structural features in the length scale for nanotechnology (1-100 nanometers) can allow the development of a new understanding of biological and physical phenomena in agricultural and food systems. In addition, nanotechnology allows scientists to measure, control, and manipulate matter at the nanoscale to change those properties and functions to the benefit of these systems. Polymeric nanoparticles developed at LSU can potentially be used as controlled delivery and release devices for bioactive components (i.e. vitamins and antioxidants) in biomedical, cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical applications. Nanoparticles can be designed to deliver the antioxidant/vitamin to the specific site of action with minimal degradation of the bioactive component during delivery. The antioxidant/vitamin is then potentially released in a controlled manner by controlling the degradation profile of the polymer, or by using  smart  polymers which interact with the cell environment (temperature, pH, enzymes, ionic strength, and other) in a predictable way. The impact of the technology is vast. Bioactive food components have been associated with the prevention and/or treatment of chronic diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis. Successful encapsulation and delivery of bioactive components (i.e. vitamin E) extracted from plant materials (i.e. rice bran) in polymeric nanoparticles can bring new revenues to the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries.

647,"University Floral Trial Garden: The green industry is the second largest agriculture sector in Maryland; however, the lower shore region only represents a small portion of horticultural sales and services (3%) in Maryland. Trial gardens provide a forum for research that allows growers to choose the most suitable plants by comparing new varieties with traditional ones. The University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) floral trial garden will continue to help green industry professionals determine which flowering plants look great, last the longest, and deliver the greatest yield. The trial garden has greatly benefited the seed companies that participated in the previous trials and has proven to be a valuable resource for the local green industry on the Delmarva Peninsula. Through the continuation of the university floral trials, we will be able to continue to provide information and services to stakeholders and the green industry professionals to enhance the profitability of the lower shore region's green industry. The new project will evaluate plants longer into the fall/winter season. Evaluations will continue until the plants have completely died. This information will be of interest to the stakeholders because they will have evaluation data on plants that may thrive well after their recommended growing season. Beneficial Microorganisms Research: Many greenhouse and nursery production operations use a combination of fertilizers, growth regulators, fungicides, and insecticides to mass-produce ornamental plants in high volumes on small acreages. Non-point sources of pollutants are having a negative impact on the quality of water in watersheds and aquifers throughout the United States. The use of biofertilizers containing beneficial microorganisms instead of synthetic chemicals has been known to improve plant growth through the supply of plant nutrients and may help to sustain environmental health and soil productivity. Beneficial microorganisms, such as mychorrizal fungi, are recognized for their benefits to plant growth and development and improved water relations. The variation in mycorrhizal responsiveness to a specific fungus by cultivars of the same host has been reported for field-grown crops, such as peanuts, basil, onions, alfalfa, cowpea, peas, tomatoes, soybean, corn barley, and rice. However, there has been little research conducted in the United States documenting responsiveness to mycorrhizal inoculation of greenhouse or other ornamental plants where extensive breeding has occurred, and where there are multitudes of cultivars and varieties selected for their aesthetic or landscape traits. Therefore, evaluating the responsiveness to microbial inoculation with isolates of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza fungal species on different cultivars of popular annual and bedding plants can greatly influence the economic and production practice of Maryland's green industry while reducing the negative environmental impacts of chemical fertilizers.

649,"Climate change is predicted to increase the surface temperatures and change precipitation patterns leading to decreased water supplies and increased algal bloom occurrences. It has been shown that warmer temperatures and higher nitrogen and phosphorus (nutrient) levels promote growth of toxic cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria, are photosynthetic, unicellular bacteria found in most surface waters around the world. Throughout their life cycle, they produce and release various metabolites which can be just taste-and-odor compounds or may be toxic and cause adverse health effects. The microcystins are the most common cyanobacterial toxins detected in the surface waters around the world. They are highly water soluble and are on the USEPA Contaminant Candidate List III. Cyanotoxins have been found all across the world including in Colorado and related poisonings have been reported in 50 countries and at least 36 states in the US while most of these poisonings affected animals. Irrigation and stock ponds providing higher levels of nutrients and stagnant conditions are highly vulnerable to algal blooms especially during warm spring to fall months. The recent studies reported that algal toxins may adversely impact the germination of seeds, and affect the growth, quality and productivity of crops. Exposure of several crops such as lettuce, rape, ryegrass, and rice to various concentrations of microcystins indicated that photosynthesis was reduced by 50%, root development was inhibited, especially in rape. Also several studies as well as many news articles reported the death of cattle and pets due to cyanobacterial toxin poisoning. Death of 4 cattle in southern Georgia in 1997 prompted investigations and again the cause of deaths was identified as toxins released by the massive algal bloom in the stock pond. The number of deaths was confined to only four as the herd was moved away from the pond immediately. There are no current research studies on occurrence and effects of toxins on cattle poisoning and crop growth in a full scale system, however this is an emerging area to be studied to be able to prevent tragic poisoning events of cattle and loss of food sources. It should also be noted that safe algae bloom prevention and pond management practices should be determined and adopted for the irrigation and stock ponds as some chemical algal inhibitors may impact the growth and quality of the crops. The objective of this project is to check the occurrence of toxic and odorous algal metabolites in agricultural ponds in Northern Colorado through instrumental analysis of water samples collected over summer, fall and spring months, and to assess their impacts on the irrigation water quality, crop growth and cattle health. The data will inform the researchers and hence the farmers of the likelihood of such issues and will enable them to take action before the problems are exacerbated. Guidance will be provided by the researchers on how to manage the ponds to prevent algal blooms and release of their metabolites. This way loss of cattle and produce will be prevented.

650,"The outcome of this research will play an important role in increasing the nutritional content of important food crops and also increase the tolerance of germinating seeds to abiotic stress. In regards to human nutrition, thiamin (Vitamin B1) is an essential plant derived nutrient in human and animal diets. While not limiting in typical Western diets, thiamin deficiencies are common in developing countries where people subsist on diets consisting primarily of polished grains and seed products. By increasing thiamin levels in the seeds of important subsistence crop species such as rice and wheat, we can make a positive impact on human nutrition and global food security. In regards to abiotic stress tolerance, it has been shown that high thiamin containing seeds are better able to germinate and survive under environmental stress conditions including high and low temperature, drought and saline conditions. Seedlings stress tolerance in particularly important during the spring planting season in Nevada's high desert regions where dramatic temperature shifts are common. By engineering seeds for elevated thiamin, we will increase the nutritional value of seeds while at the same time increasing the survivability of the following generation's crop. The proposed research will significantly benefit global food security by leading to the development of more nutritious and stress tolerant food crops. Additionally, workshops will be developed in conjunction with the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension to educate the public on topics related to plant biotechnology and GMO food crops.

651,"Both grain and specialty crops are increasingly grown under conditions of moderate to severe water, temperature, or ion stress. This stress most commonly takes the form of a combination of salt (resulting from fertilizer aggregation in irrigation water, or the use of contaminated well water) and thermal stresses, but can also encompass drought stress or nutrient stress caused by the use of marginal soils. The acceleration of global warming and the increased demands on global water supplies will only exacerbate these problems, and highlight the crucial need to develop both plant species capable of maintaining production under adverse environmental conditions. Several studies have provided key evidence that several process associated with the plant cell membrane system, including lipid signaling, regulation of hormone transport, and production of steroids or other terpenoid secondary products, play an important role in mediating responses to stress stimuli. The proposed research will define the biochemical mechanisms by which these processes regulate plant adaptation to environmental injury and insult. Further, the research will identify key steps/components of these pathways, allowing them to be targeted for manipulation to increase crop stress tolerance. Completion of the research described in the project will provide information that will contribute substantially to the fundamental understanding of the methods by which crop species adapt to abiotic stress conditions. By defining the role of lipid signaling in regulating protein phosphorylation and auxin transport, these pathways can be used to control plant growth and development, improving stress tolerance and agricultural yields. Initial research efforts have focused on rice, a crop species which yields $1.5 billion to the US in export annually and is the staple food grain for approximately two-thirds of the world's population. The crucial importance of rice as a food crop worldwide was recently highlighted by a global rice shortage, leading to dramatic increases in rice prices and food shortages throughout Asia, particularly in the Philippines and Vietnam (U.N. Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs). The conserved nature of the mechanisms investigated in the proposal across both monocot and dicot crop species, however, means that progress made in rice could easily be transferred to other important monocot crop species including maize and sorghum. As all of the pathways investigated in the research (lipid signaling, auxin transport, and sterol/terpenoid production) function as signaling  hubs  controlling multiple downstream responses and having conserved functions in several stress resposnses, modulation of these pathways could be used to simultaneously improve tolerance to multiple stresses and improve agricultural yields of crops grown under a variety of stress conditions Acceleration; Agriculture; Asia; Auxins; Biochemical; Biochemistry; Biology; Cell membrane; Cereals; Droughts; environmental adaptation; Fertilizers; Food; food shortage; Global Warming; hormone regulation; Hormones; Human; improved; Injury; Ions; Irrigation; Lipids; Maize; Mediating; medical specialties; Membrane; Metabolism; Methods; Nature; Nutrient; Pathway interactions; Philippines; Phosphorylation; plant growth/development; Plants; Play; Population; Price; Process; Production; Research; response; Rice; Role; Signal Transduction; Sodium Chloride; Soil; Steroids; Sterols; Stimulus; Stress; stress tolerance; System; Temperature; Terpenes; thermal stress; Vietnam; Water; Water SupplyINCREASING PLANT ENVIRONMENTAL ADAPTATION THROUGH MANIPULATION OF MEMBRANE BIOCHEMISTRY, HORMONE BIOLOGY, AND TERPENOID METABOLISM",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.9998832041351118,0.9524539606994541,1e-06

653,"Plant micropropagation has been a commercial biotechnology for 40 years, with annual US production estimated between 100-150 M units annually. Micropropagation delivers quality plantlets on time without propagating their diseases and insects. The inadvertent spread of agricultural pest by intercontinental and international commerce of planting stock is best controlled by avoidance. Most tissue-cultured plantlets are sold as rooted liners (as opposed to unrooted microcuttings). The rooted liner is a fragile, bulky commodity with the potential of carrying pests from bark-based media constantly saturated on the mist-bed. We will expand the value of tissue culture by better integrating laboratory cleanliness with subsequent growth, to maximize value in the end-users nursery. The most immediate application is in perennial, ornamental plants. These plants have among the highest unit value per propagule. Tens of millions of tissue-cultured plants are finished to saleable containers in the Southeastern US every year. Production nurseries, and their retail partners, benefit with profitability, cleanliness, reduced pesticides and reduced risks of product loss. A more advanced technology for micropropagation, somatic embryogenesis and the resulting emblings are currently poised to increase the size of micropropagation nurseries. Clonal plantation and forest crops are joining micropropagated ornamental plants as commercially propagated commodities. Enabling technologies for efficient transition of in vitro somatic emblings to vigorous ex vitro nursery stock requires integration of laboratory and greenhouse systems. In the opinion of this author, this is a bottleneck in the current state of the art. Loosening the bottleneck benefits the propagation laboratories, and associated tree nurseries in this region, their expanding workforce, and landowners that make use of these advanced forest tree products. Genetic engineering and transgenic breeding of the large agronomic crops (i.e. maize, soy, cotton, rice) requires millions of unique emblings per year. The agri-biotechnology industry is also a potential beneficiary projects to streamline delivery of microplants to nursery. Rootstocks of peach trees are currently produced as seedlings in North America. In Asia and Europe, micropropagated rootstocks of Prunus, Malus, and Pyrus are commercially preferred due to higher levels of resistance and uniformity in clonal selections. In North America, large-scale micropropagation of clonal apple rootstocks has begun. Clonal rootstocks of peach, like clonal forest trees, will benefit nursery propagator and orchard fruit producer alike. We believe both mineral nutrition and specialized handling of rooted microcuttings will greatly enhance the plant quality. North America has much non-domesticated flora with unrealized potential as sources of medicinal compounds. Wild-collecting native species will decimate populations of native, medicinal plants (or in some cases, already has). Medicinal plants from tissue culture may be transferred to simulated wild-conditions for finishing.

654,"We propose to study regulation of genes and pathways controlling key developmental processes or biosynthesis of bioactive metabolites using genomic tools. Plant, being sessile, is able to sense environmental changes or developmental cues and to initiate an expression response. The expression response can either be transient (e.g., induction of pathogen responses) or long lasting (e.g., changes in developmental programs). Epigenetic systems are known to be part of the relay from sensing a change in the environment to a change in transcriptional state. For example, histone modification changes play a central role in regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis in response to prolonged exposure to cold temperature (known as vernalization). Other epigenetic modifications, such as cytosine methylation, are inherited in plants and have long been postulated to occur in response to biotic or abiotic stress(1). However, little is known about epigenetics and plant responses to environmental change and developmental switches. To learn more about the characteristics of DNA methylation changes and their underlying molecular mechanisms, we will use whole genome bisulfite sequencing method to profile methylation patterns of rice and Arabidopsis that have been subjected to various environmental stresses (e.g., cold temperature, high salt, etc), or at different developmental stages. We will determine the corresponding expression profiles by high throughput RNA-sequencing. We will also profile small RNA population changes in response to environmental stress or developmental switches to better understanding the roles of siRNA in mediating DNA methylation changes.

657,"Rice and wheat are the top two sources of calories in the human diet, and both are important export crops for the U.S. Rice blast disease, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae remains an explosive threat to rice production in the U.S. and globally. Since 1985 when M. oryzae first appeared on wheat in Brazil, blast has become a major constraint to wheat production in several South American countries. It is critical to prevent establishment of wheat blast in the U.S. Disease control is complicated by the lack of a clear understanding of how the disease develops and spreads in the field, by extreme variability shown by the fungus and by unknowns associated with climate change. We will apply knowledge gained through previous research and cloned blast resistance genes for disease control, including developing methods for choosing effective resistance genes and rapidly deploying them, methods for forecasting disease risk and informing farmers of the best control options, and novel methods to control disease by turning off fungal genes needed for disease. Although genetic resistance is the most effective way to control blast diseases, high-yielding rice varieties preferred by U.S. farmers generally lack resistance. These varieties require expensive fungicide applications when weather conditions favor disease. There is urgent need for efficient strategies to move new resistance (R) genes into elite rice varieties while maintaining yield and quality. We will develop cisgenic technology, in which only rice DNA sequences are introduced, to precisely incorporate resistance genes into elite rice varieties. Adoption of cisgenic rice by U.S. farmers requires consumer acceptance in the U.S. as well as in Europe and other import markets. We will assess consumer attitudes in the U.S. and Europe toward cisgenic rice, as compared to transgenic rice in which some non-rice DNA sequences are also introduced. Strategies for promoting consumer acceptance will be developed based on this assessment. In contrast, few wheat blast resistance genes have been identified. We address this with strategies to identify wheat resistance genes through field tests of U.S. wheat varieties against native pathogen populations in South America. We will also test if moving rice resistance genes into wheat will provide effective wheat blast resistance. Development and use of a blast forecasting model will inform farmers if and when they need to apply fungicides, and will warn first responders when the weather is right for wheat blast disease to occur. Understanding wheat blast biology and training a first-responder network will enable rapid detection and response to any wheat blast outbreaks in the U.S. We will also develop novel strategies for blast control based on designing plants that block the fungus from expressing genes it needs to cause disease. Our extension programs will produce publications and workshops to inform extension specialists, farmers and other first responders about wheat blast and the novel disease management strategies. We will design and implement educational activities to attract undergraduate students to careers in plant pathology and in plant biosecurity.

660,"This project develops the theory and technology for a new frontier in cyber-physical systems: cyber-physical manipulation. The goal of cyber-physical manipulation is to enable groups of hundreds or thousands of individual robotic agents to collaboratively explore an environment, manipulate objects in that environment, and transport those objects to desired locations. The project embraces realistic assumptions about the communication, computation, and sensing capabilities of simple individual robots, leading to algorithmic solutions that intrinsically leverage population size in favor of complex agents. Cyber-physical solutions for locating, grasping, and characterizing objects require tools based on distributed computational geometry, while the tasks of planning a path, initiating motion, and controlling the trajectory require tools from decentralized control and consensus. The project lays the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of cyber-physical manipulation, and proves the feasibility of the concept experimentally in hardware tests with up to 100 individual robots. The project uses the problem of manipulation as a stage on which to explore the deeper cyber-physical issue of information asymmetry; the difference in the state of the world as perceived by different agents in the system due to differences in their history of observations, and limitations in their communication capabilities.The object retrieval problem studied in this project is an elemental building block for enabling more complex cyber-physical manipulation tasks. It provides crucial algorithmic components for numerous applications of broad societal benefit, including automated construction (in which hundreds or thousands of robots fabricate large, complex structures), autonomous emergency response (in which large teams of robots find and retrieve incapacitated human survivors after a disaster), and automated environmental cleanup (in which robots secure a dangerous environment by removing debris or hazardous substances). Furthermore, distributed algorithms for multi-agent systems are of broad scientific relevance beyond the realm of cyberphysical systems. The natural world is, in its algorithmic essence, decentralized at many levels. Hence, any advancement in the understanding of how groups of individual agents collaborate to accomplish a coherent task will have broad scientific ramifications. The project has a robust educational and outreach program. One aspect is a hands-on curriculum for robotics outreach activities, called the ''Cyber-Physical Manipulation Lab.'' Using a custom-designed robot platform, this educational module introduces the theory and practice of cyber-physical systems to young students to attract them to STEM subject areas at an early age.

661,"This project develops the theory and technology for a new frontier in cyber-physical systems: cyber-physical manipulation. The goal of cyber-physical manipulation is to enable groups of hundreds or thousands of individual robotic agents to collaboratively explore an environment, manipulate objects in that environment, and transport those objects to desired locations. The project embraces realistic assumptions about the communication, computation, and sensing capabilities of simple individual robots, leading to algorithmic solutions that intrinsically leverage population size in favor of complex agents. Cyber-physical solutions for locating, grasping, and characterizing objects require tools based on distributed computational geometry, while the tasks of planning a path, initiating motion, and controlling the trajectory require tools from decentralized control and consensus. The project lays the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of cyber-physical manipulation, and proves the feasibility of the concept experimentally in hardware tests with up to 100 individual robots.

662,"The project, Houston-Cyberinfrastructure (HoustonCI), establishes a flow separation and analysis system for the University of Houston campus network while enabling high bandwidth data transfers from domain science laboratories on the University of Houston and Rice University campuses. These laboratories all connect to the regional networks LEARN (Lonestar Education and Research Network, Texas-wide network with over 30 institution members), SETG (SouthEast Texas Gigapop, Houston-based fiber loop with University of Houston, Rice University, Texas Medical Center, and other institutional members in Houston area), GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovation), and Internet2 100 Gbps software-defined network (SDN). In this respect, the project has two objectives: (i) leverage software-defined networking  (SDN) to separate flows for better monitoring of where high data transfer needs and network issues are; and (ii) pave the way towards connecting with 100 Gbps cyber-infrastructure of Internet2. The research and development effort is in the creation of a troubleshooting framework that utilizes OpenFlow protocol flow definitions.The impact of the project will be on campus network engineers having a deeper exposure to network utilization by science data transfers. On one hand, such a troubleshooting capability will better the network design and planning processes on campuses. On the other hand, the domain scientists will be able to communicate science data transfer needs with network engineers. SDN will enable effective allocation of bandwidth with savings in campus networking investments by institutions. The research methods and results will be tested and demonstrated by utilizing the GENI infrastructure as an experimentation testbed.

663,"The timing of flowering is critical for plant survival, and in agricultural settings proper timing of flowering is critical for maximal yield. In many plant species, flowering occurs at a particular time of year in response to the sensing of seasonal cues such as changes in the length of day and temperature.  This project is designed to further our understanding of how the timing of flowering is regulated by environmental cues at a molecular level in the grasses. Despite the fact that grasses include important food crops such as wheat, rice and corn and potential bioenergy crops such as switchgrass, sorghum and miscanthus, little is known about how flowering is regulated at a molecular level in the grasses. This project will employ Brachypodium distachyon as a model because this grass species exhibits a large range of natural variation in flowering behavior that is genetically tractable, and it is straightforward to identify the genes responsible for genetic differences in flowering among different Brachypodium varieties. Understanding achieved by this project has the potential to inform research designed to improve the productivity of food and bioenergy crops.  This project will result in the training of graduate students and postdocs for independent careers in science, and will provide undergraduates with an opportunity to learn about research in genetics, molecular biology and plant biology.  Students and postdocs working on this project are also encouraged to contribute to our efforts to bring understanding of plant biology into K-12 classrooms.

668,"This project will deploy an optically networked systems research infrastructure named BOLD that integrates high-performance, low-power, optical networking devices and programmable packet switches to enable transformative and inter-disciplinary research.  It enables experimental exploration of different architectural design choices and it will potentially suggest new approaches to integrated hardware-software designs.  At the hardware level, it enables research on novel optical network devices that can provide powerful communication capabilities, possibly tailored to the specific needs of big data applications, as well as experimentation with the device prototypes under real application traffic. BOLD enables a broad range of transformative big data-driven research. At the system software level, it enables research on storage, network, and application control software that are designed from the ground up to coordinate for optimal performance. At the application level, BOLD motivates research on how fundamental algorithms for big data applications should be designed to leverage the new network capabilities. BOLD has the unique potential to bridge the gap between nano-photonics researchers, networked systems researchers, and big data application researchers, creating inter-disciplinary research opportunities. Furthermore, because BOLD is designed to operate alongside Rice?s existing NSF-funded computing infrastructures BOLD can support big data experiments at a substantial scale.Results from the inter-disciplinary research enabled by BOLD will lead to future big data processing system architectures that dramatically speed up a wide range of computational scientific discoveries. Because optical networking devices are unique in that they consume very little power, yet can support enormous data rates, BOLD will inspire a new class of high performance, high energy efficiency system architectures. Research enabled by BOLD could inform the design of future nation-wide networking infrastructures by showing how optical networks can be harnessed as shared ?cloud? resources. BOLD will serve as a platform for the training and education of numerous undergraduate and graduate students, including under-represented groups, in cutting edge big data-driven research.

669,"This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award provides Ph.D. students at Rice University with innovative training in neuroengineering, spanning the disciplines of neuroscience, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and bioengineering. In collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine and seven other universities and participating organizations, Rice University trainees are developing the tools to understand, interface with, model, and manipulate the nervous system.Intellectual Merit: Due to improved technologies that enable neuroscientists to interact with brain cells, and due to the increasing types of neuroscientific data collected through electrical and optical methods, the neuroengineers who create and work with these complex data sets require highly specialized training. This program trains students in three specific areas: (1) cellular systems neuroengineering, which studies the nervous system?s signaling processes at the molecular and cellular levels; (2) engineering multi-neuron circuits, which involves collecting and analyzing data from groups of brain cells and devising methods to induce them to produce new functional responses; and (3) translational neuroengineering, which develops systematic approaches to improve clinical devices such as prosthetics and deep brain stimulators. Trainees in this program are learning to be technologically innovative; to be aware of social, cultural, and ethical aspects of neuroengineering; to communicate their work effectively to a wide variety of audiences; and to understand the pathways to commercialize their discoveries.Broader Impacts: As this program trains neuroengineers to develop advanced solutions to functional and structural problems in the brain, a new problem-based learning curriculum will result and will be shared with the public through open education resources. By cultivating relationships with biomedical device companies, international researchers, and collaborators within two minority-serving institutions in Texas, students in this program are expanding the applications of their training and increasing participation in their research.IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and leadership  skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated into innovations that benefit society.

670,"PI: John W. Peters (Montana State University)CoPIs: Jean-Michel Ane (University of Wisconsin - Madison), Michael Udvardi (The Samuel Roberts Nobel Foundation) and Christopher A. Voigt (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)Key Collaborators: Giles E. Oldroyd (John Innes Centre, UK) and Phillip S. Poole (John Innes Centre, Oxford University, UK)Nitrogen is an essential element of biological molecules and life on earth.  Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Scarcity of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fiber and fuel.  Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation in a type of bacteria, diazotrophs, that are able to reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules.  Biological nitrogen fixation is promoted by a complex metal containing enzyme called nitrogenase, whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst bacteria.  Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia.  As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, many important food species, including the grasses maize/corn, rice, and wheat cannot establish effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs, making them dependent on nitrogenous fertilizers for high yield. Large-scale use of industrially-produced nitrogen-fertilizer has doubled the influx of nitrogen into the terrestrial biogeochemical nitrogen-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment.   Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive nitrogen-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators from the US and UK to solve the dual nitrogen problems of nitrogen-fertilizer over-use in developed countries and soil nitrogen-paucity in developing countries by developing effective endophytic (bacteria inside the root) and associative (bacteria attached outside the root) nitrogen-fixing symbioses in a model and a crop plant species.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop effective N2-fixing symbioses between the model C4-grass, Setaria viridis, as well as the related crop species, Zea mays, with the endophytic bacterium, Rhizobium sp. IRBG74, as well as the associative bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescenes Pf5.  Successful deployment of biological nitrogen fixation in model or crop grass species will pave the way for a second Green Revolution to increase crop yields for resource-poor farmers and decrease the use and environmental-impact of industrial nitrogen-fertilizers by wealthier farmers. This project will establish a powerful new model system for the study of plant-microbe interactions and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in engineering new associative relationships and interdependencies that have the potential to be universal for all crop plants.  It will test this potential in the important crop, maize.  The integrated US-UK research partnership will provide a unique training opportunity for students and post-doctoral associates with active exchange of personnel between academic laboratories and research foundations in both countries.  Data and materials generated in the study including plasmid constructs and genetically modified bacterial and plant species will be made available via websites maintained in the US and the UK.  To broaden the impact of the work, traditional and non-traditional outreach strategies will be used to help K-12 teachers, students, and the public understand the fundamentals and benefits of interdisciplinary research and the implications of synthetic biology for the next generation of biotechnological solutions in agriculture.

671,"FULL STEM, a Type 1, Phase 1 Noyce project, is a five year teacher preparation program leading to the production of 33 new science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) teachers prepared to teach in high needs schools. Noyce Scholars graduate with a major in a STEM field and a Master of Science for Teachers (MST) in Adolescence Education degree or a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree in a STEM field. The program includes: teaching internship opportunities for undergraduates; two undergraduate courses in science and math learning including a field specific teaching component specifically designed for the needs of the Noyce Scholars; National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) certified and clinically rich MST and MAT programs; extensive mentoring by teacher-scholars prior to and throughout the masters programs. The project supports teachers during their early years of teaching by providing continuing mentoring by teacher scholars, workshops to address challenges encountered by new teachers, online resources for discipline specific teaching, and a discussion board for continuous interfacing with other teachers and Noyce personnel. The program is a partnership between SUNY Oswego College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and School of Education faculty, eighteen local community colleges (Onondaga, Jefferson, Cayuga, Tompkins County, Monroe, Hudson, Mohawk Valley, Broome, Clinton, Columbia-Greene, Corning, Finger Lakes, Genesee, Hudson Valley, Jamestown, Adirondack, North Country, and Niagara County), Syracuse and Oswego school districts, Beaver Lake Nature Center, Rice Creek Field Station, and Rosamund Gifford Zoo. Intellectual Merit:  This program, by recruiting STEM undergraduates or holders of STEM degrees, and providing them with financial support to complete their masters degrees in teaching in an environment that supports their development into  highly qualified dynamic teachers, is helping high need schools offer enriched STEM experiences to the many worthy students they serve.  Broader Impacts: The program can be emulated by other institutions with strong science and math teacher education programs. The interaction between the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the School of Education models the type of collaboration needed to produce STEM teachers who combine a love of their discipline with strong pedagogy skills.

672,"StaFest conference will be held on October 12, 2013 at Rice University. The StaFest is an annual event partially supported by the American Statistical Association through the Committee on Minorities in Statistics. This year, the International Year of Statistics, this event will be especially significant. The goal of the StatFest is to showcase the work by statisticians in all realms of human endeavors, and by doing so, to encourage undergraduate students -- mostly non-traditional and underrepresented -- to pursue graduate careers in the statistical sciences. In addition, opportunities for graduate fellowships are discussed in the context of opportunities for graduate work in specific institutions. These goals are achieved by gathering a cadre of dynamic speakers who are top researchers in their respective domains (government, industry, academia, etc.) who are able to transmit their enthusiasm for the statistical sciences. In addition, a panel of graduate students discusses more specifically opportunities, challenges, and anecdotes that can be helpful for the soon-to-be graduate students. The conference also offers plenty of one-on-one discussion opportunities between undergraduate students and professional statisticians through communitarian meals (breakfast, lunch, and two coffee breaks) and, for the first time in the history of StatFests, an undergraduate research poster session at the end of the day. Students that will be recruited from across Texas. Traditionally the StatFest has recruited students from institutions in the host city. But this year, due to the International Year of Statistics, it is envisioned that the event will have more of a regional impact rather than a local one. The conference will assemble a group of top professional statisticians from academia, industry and government to showcase their activities with the purpose of enticing undergraduate students to pursue graduate careers in the statistical sciences. Students, mostly from underrepresented groups in the statistical sciences, engage in conversations about, and learn about cutting edge problems and solutions in, various realms of scientific inquiry, and most importantly, students come to appreciate the fundamental role that the statistical sciences play in supporting and guiding the fundamental scientific research and in the process get interested in pursuing graduate careers. The StatFest continues to have a major positive impact on the decisions of undergraduate students regarding graduate work. As a substantial percentage of those students attending the StatFest are from underrepresented groups in the statistical sciences, the StatFest -- clearly and compellingly-- provides a launching platform for many underrepresented students. These efforts will have an impact in helping to alleviate the well-documented national critical need to train more students from underrepresented groups in postgraduate careers in the mathematical sciences.

673,"The goal of this project is to understand how preconditioning of the magnetotail during periods of northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) or high solar wind velocity affects the inner magnetosphere.  During northward IMF a cold dense plasma sheet forms which when the IMF subsequently turns southward flows into the inner magnetosphere. It appears as super-dense plasma at synchronous orbit and then becomes accelerated and contributes to the ring current. While it is generally accepted that this process occurs the parameters that control it, how the energization takes place and the effects are not well understood. This study will use the OpenGGCM global MHD simulation coupled with two ring current models (the Rice Convection Model (RCM) and the Comprehensive Ring Current Model (CRCM)).

674,"Overview: There is a growing appreciation for the ubiquity of microbial symbioses on earth, yet in most habitats we have only a basic understanding of their physiology and ecology. Many eukaryotes have evolved specific associations with prokaryotes that capitalize on the relative diversity of prokaryotic metabolisms. In terms of numbers, symbiont populations often rival or exceed free-living prokaryotes in their environment, therefore, through their metabolism, symbionts may have a significant effect on their biotic and abiotic environment. Despite this, there is limited knowledge of the symbiotic function and metabolic activity of most symbiotic taxa.Symbioses between anaerobic protists and intracellular, methanogenic archaea have been found in many anoxic habitats, however the contribution of symbiont-produced methane (CH4) to the marine CH4 cycle is yet unconstrained. In non-marine environments, like rice paddies and lakes, they have been found to significantly contribute to the production of CH4, suggesting that these symbioses may be important to the biogeochemical cycling of this climate-active gas. However, though taxa known to host methanogens have been detected in general surveys of protists in oxygen (O2) -poor and anoxic marine water columns, to date, they have never been specifically surveyed, and no studies have quantified their contribution to CH4 production in these habitats. Additionally, outside of their methanogenic function, nothing is known about the physiological capacity of their symbionts. To develop an understanding of the details of these partnerships and to address the contribution of microbial symbionts to the CH4 cycle, the fellow will examine the ecology and physiology of methanogen-protist symbioses in Saanich Inlet (SI), a seasonally anoxic fjord off the coast of British Columbia, Canada that accumulates CH4 (greater than 1 micrometer) in its deep water from a yet unconstrained source. With sponsor Dr. Virginia Edgcomb at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), the fellow will combine a) fluorescence-activated cell sorting based surveys of the abundance and diversity of methanogen-hosting protists, with assessment of their metabolism through b) the experimental measurement of CH4 production by natural populations and c) analysis of total symbiont gene content (i.e., genomics). This robust combination of observational and experimental approaches will provide valuable insight into distribution, physiology and activity of these symbioses, allowing the first estimation of the contribution of protist-associated methanogens to CH4 production in an anoxic marine water column. Intellectual merit: Anoxic and low-O2 marine water columns are thought to contribute 50-60% of the global oceanic emission of CH4, a climate-active gas. It is typically assumed that the CH4 in these habitats originates from the underlying sediment, where methanogenesis is known to occur. Water column production is presumed to be unimportant in these areas, as free-living methanogens cannot compete successfully with sulfate-reducing bacteria for common substrates (e.g, Hydrogen) in sulfate-replete seawater. However, symbiotic methanogens are protected from competition with sulfate-reducing bacteria since substrates are host provided. Consequently, methanogenesis by the symbionts of protists in the water column may account for a significant fraction of the CH4 budget in these areas. Thus, the proposed effort will substantially advance our understanding of the underlying source of CH4 in O2-deficient and anoxic marine habitats. Since rising temperatures are predicted to cause the expansion of oxygen-depleted habitats, better insight into CH4 cycling in these areas will become increasingly important to our understanding and modeling of global oceanic CH4 emissions. Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of the proposed effort include disseminating the findings to the scientific and wider community through public lectures, and supporting participation of underrepresented groups in ocean sciences research through mentorship of 1-2 undergraduates in the WHOI Summer Student and Minority Fellowship programs. Additionally, funds from the annual fellowship allowance have been budgeted to develop an educational unit about marine symbioses with a local non-profit marine education foundation. This unit will be presented by the fellow to K-12 students from disadvantaged communities from the southern New England area.

675,"The contamination of rice grains by arsenic is a global problem.  Since arsenic is a poison, rice consumption may pose a threat to human health.  This project aims to decrease the arsenic concentration in rice grains and thus protect human health from rice consumption by amending soil with soluble silicon (Si).  Increased dissolved silicon can decrease root-uptake and grain-levels of arsenic due to competition for plant-uptake of arsenite (the dominant form in rice paddy soil solution) by dissolved silicon because arsenite and silicon share an uptake pathway in rice.  While the total amount of silicon in soils is high, the soluble (and thus plant-available) silicon is much lower, particularly in older (more weathered) soils where most rice is grown and where silicon accumulating plants (such as rice) mine silicon out of soil and are removed.  Return of silicon to soil from rice residues with a high Si content may decrease arsenic uptake/grain storage, increase yields, and thus protect human health.  Since fresh plant material may promote greenhouse gas production, this project will test the effect of rice husk ash (which is high in silicon) on decreasing arsenic uptake and concentration in rice grains.  If proven effective, this management practice could be adopted worldwide, including small-holder farms in the developing world, with minimal cost or change to current management strategies.  This project will allow for the purchase of a closed-vessel microwave digestion unit which will aid the Principal Investigator, Dr. Seyfferth, in establishing her research group and allowing her and her group to conduct basic science for years to come.  Finally, Dr. Seyfferth has a proven record of involving members of underrepresented groups in science, which will continue throughout this project and in future projects.

Next-generation energy storage materials must simultaneously satisfy a number of criteria: excellent charge and ion transport, high capacity, and reversible charge transfer. For this reason, electron- and ion-conducting polymers are often explored as additives in cathodes such as V2O5, LiCoO2, LiFePO4, etc. to form hybrid electrodes. Unfortunately, it remains extremely difficult to obtain a hybrid electrode that successfully balances electron and ion transport with charge transfer because of large-scale phase separation and poor structure control among the electrode?s various components. This project will investigate a model system of hybrid electrodes for energy storage based on nanostructured blends of poly(3-alkylthiophene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (P3AT-b-PEO) multifunctional block copolymers and V2O5. P3AT-b-PEO is capable of simultaneous electron and ion transport, and V2O5 is a commonly explored high-capacity cathode material for Li-ion batteries. V2O5 will be synthesized within selected polymer blocks using ?structure directed? synthesis. The PIs hypothesize that through bottom- up assembly methods, the resulting hybrid materials will exhibit favorable properties characteristic of both organic and inorganic components. This project will determine the relationship between block copolymer composition and morphology as it is affected by V2O5, side chain functionalization,   and   electrochemical   performance.   The   relationship   between  block   copolymer morphology  and  charge  transfer,  electron  transport,  and  ion  transport  has  never  before  been systematically investigated as a whole, so the proposed research will establish a broad knowledge base to guide the development of multifunctional block copolymers for energy storage. First, the PIs will establish relationships between the morphology of hybrid electrodes containing block copolymer bearing a single type of side chain and V2O5 and electrochemical performance (Objectives 1 and 2). This knowledge will then be applied to a wider family of block copolymers of varying side chain chemistry so as to balance electrochemical properties with processability.The proposed work will have broader impacts within the scientific community as well as the general public through educational activities and outreach. Within the scientific community, this work will establish a knowledge base for multifunctional block copolymers in electrodes, where several processes (reaction and diffusion) must be balanced.

678,"This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2013. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Julie Thomas is  Analysis of Alternative Splicing in Drought Regulated Genes for Stress Tolerance in Rice . The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Arkansas and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andy Pereira.Alternative splicing forms multiple transcripts from individual genes that can generate very rapid changes in functional transcripts by post-transcriptional processing to help the plant respond to environmental stresses. The objectives of this project are: 1) analysis of alternative splicing in rice in response to drought stress using RNA-Seq; 2) new developments in RNA-Seq technology and Bioinformatics will be used to identify stress responsive differentially expressed alternatively spliced transcripts; and, 3) evaluation of alternatively spliced transcripts in a rice genotype diversity panel, to study the association to drought stress response phenotypes or stress parameters. Alternatively spliced transcripts that distinguish drought tolerance can be developed as functional markers for molecular breeding.Training objectives include bioinformatics, crop plant genomics, drought physiology, and molecular breeding approaches. Broader impacts include enhancement of the capacity for conducting interdisciplinary research in plant improvement and associated sciences such as bioinformatics, physiology, genomics and molecular breeding. The project will also address a major problem of climate change, the response of plants to changing environments in which drought and other abiotic stresses are becoming more frequent. An understanding of how water scarcity affects crop yields would be a major contribution towards making crops more tolerant to drought stress.

Cakoni, University of Delaware (chair), L. Borcea, Rice University, Houssem Haddar, Ecole Polytechnique, France, Peter Monk, University of Delaware. For more information on the meeting please visit  http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~colton/    This Conference will be a gathering of  international experts as well as junior researchers in the area of inverse scattering theory with the focus being on novel techniques for solving inverse scattering problems.  On the basis of current research trends and the wide spectrum of inverse scattering applications, we focus on the following topics at the forefront of research in this area: non-iterative techniques to determine the physical properties of complex penetrable targets (obstacles) with anisotropy, attenuation, or internal length scales as well as the reconstruction of surface- or line-like objects in a three- dimensional environment; cloaking; imaging through complex background media with e.g. random or periodic heterogeneities; multi-frequency and time-domain extensions of the existing monochromatic solutions; adaptive sensing; thermo-acoustic and other multi-modal imaging techniques. The conference will feature plenary talks given by international experts on the aforementioned topics, invited minisymposium speakers organized  and contributed posters. Inverse problems typically occur when we wish to infer properties of objects from remote measurements. The topics of the conference involve rapidly developing mathematics at the frontiers on today''s research in the area of inverse problems.  Applicability of these type of mathematics extends to many real life applications including medical imaging, non-destructive testing, underground imaging and oil exploration, cloaking an enhance visibility. The conference will also bridge the gap between theoretical and more applied aspects of inverse scattering problems. The exchange of ideas will be  beneficial to both theoretical and applied aspects of research in inverse scattering theory.  This gathering will also celebrate the scientific accomplishments of Professor David Colton.

683,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to increase yield in wheat by using TILLING, a reverse genetics tool, to identify novel alleles of candidate wheat yield genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. In crops such as wheat with more complex genome structures and less advanced genomic tools, the major genes underlying many aspects of plant architecture are yet to be identified. However, due to functional conservation, genes regulating traits in rice (and other crops) are likely to play similar roles in wheat. Once new alleles of these genes have been identified they will be subsequently evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the greenhouse and in the field. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory restrictions. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the economic impact of improved wheat yields. The U.S. is the largest wheat exporter globally, yet the competitiveness of U.S. wheat, both globally and domestically, is declining significantly. Planted acreage is down thirty percent since the 1980s, in large part due to competition from other crops with higher returns.  Net returns to farmers from wheat are consistently half or less than that from corn and soy. With a conservative 5% increase in yield resulting from this project, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over $30/hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million annually. By incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a commercial wheat breeding program, it is believed that this project will make a significant contribution to improving the competitiveness of U.S. wheat.

The program focuses on biological networks, complex interactions among biomolecules that give rise to the diverse biological phenotypes observed in nature. Students will work on research projects under faculty mentors that draw from a range of approaches (classical biochemical and genetic to non-trivial theoretical models that require computation) to study naturally-occurring genetic networks, artificial genetic and metabolic networks, and biomolecular structure, function, and evolution. Faculty with biological interests in diverse departments will serve as mentors, including professors within the Departments of Biochemistry & Cell Biology, Bioengineering, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and workshops that focus on responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process. Students are also provided a creative opportunity to develop innovative biotechnological ideas and a capstone research poster symposium. Students will be recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on students enrolled at proximal minority-serving two- and four-year institutions. Selection of students will be done based on the faculty steering committee?s evaluation of each applicant?s transcript and recommendation letters. Rice?s Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering (IBB) administers this NSF REU Program and maintains a database of all the alumni for this program with tracking information on their career progression. Assessment of this program is done via pre- and post-questionnaires as well by using the common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs.

685,"Intellectual Merit: The PI hypothesizes that bedforms found in the Central and Joides troughs can be interpreted as having been formed by rapid retreat, and possible collapse of an ice stream that occupied this area. To test this hypothesis, the PI proposes to conduct a detailed marine geological and geophysical survey of Central and Joides Troughs in the western Ross Sea. This project will bridge gaps between the small and isolated areas previously surveyed and will acquire a detailed sedimentological record of the retreating grounding line. The PI will reconstruct the retreat history of the Central and Joides troughs to century-scale resolution using radiocarbon dating methods and by looking at geomorphic features that are formed at regular time intervals. Existing multibeam, deep tow side-scan sonar, and core data will provide a framework for this research. The western Ross Sea is an ideal study area to investigate a single ice stream and the dynamics controlling its stability, including interactions between both East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets. Broader impacts: This proposal includes a post-doc, a graduate and two undergraduate students. The post-doc is involved with teaching an in-service K-12 teacher development and training course at Rice University for high-need teachers with a focus on curriculum enhancement. The project fosters collaboration for the PI and students with researchers at Louisiana State University and international colleagues at the Institute for Paleobiology at the Polish Academy of Sciences. The results from this project could lead to a better understanding of ice sheet and ice stream stability. This project will yield implications for society''s understanding of climate change, as this work improves understanding of the behavior of ice sheets and their links to global climate.

The optics facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida, as well as the newly implemented mini-coil pulsed magnet system in the PI''s laboratory at Rice University will be utilized.  Various ultrafast optical and microspectroscopy techniques in magnetic fields will be employed to provide new insight into the states and dynamics of interacting and confined electrons in solids. Clarifying and answering the above-stated issues and questions will not only advance our understanding of carrier interactions in solids but also open up possibilities for new devices utilizing many-body effects.  This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge techniques to produce the next generation of experts in optical spectroscopy, condensed matter physics, and nanoscienec.  Furthermore, through the unique linkage with the PI''s Partnerships for International Research and Education grant from the NSF, this project will provide an opportunity for alumni of the NanoJapan: Summer Nanotechnology Research Program for Undergraduates to further their research experience with a summer internship at the NHMFL.****Non-Technical Abstract****Modern crystal growth and nanofabrication technologies allow one to create artificial nanostructures with tailored properties.  These structures provide an ideal laboratory in which to study fundamental physics problems in a highly controllable manner.  This project will investigate how individual electrons communicate with each other and behave cooperatively in three prototypical nanostructures: semiconductor quantum wells, graphene, and carbon nanotubes.   Short and intense laser pulses combined with high magnetic fields will be used; a high magnetic field provides a convenient knob for controlling electron dynamics through the magnetic quantization of the orbital and spin motions of electrons.  Facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida, as well as a pulsed high-field magnet system in the PI''s laboratory at Rice University will be utilized.  Specific questions to be addressed include: i) How do independent electron-hole pairs develop macroscopic coherence?; ii) How does a collective nature manifest itself in the quantum coherent dynamics of a two-dimensional electron gas?; and iii) How stable are one-dimensional excitons at quantum degenerate densities? Answering these questions will not only advance our understanding of carrier interactions in solids but also open up possibilities for new devices utilizing many-body effects.  We will also train undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge techniques to produce the next generation of experts in optical spectroscopy, condensed matter physics, and nanoscience. abstracting; Address; Carbon Nanotubes; density; Devices; Education; Electrons; Equilibrium; Exciton; experience; Florida; Gases; graduate student; Grant; Growth; Individual; insight; International; Internships; Laboratories; Lasers; magnetic field; Magnetism; Motion; nanofabrication; nanoscience; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Nature; next generation; Optics; Physics; Physiologic pulse; programs; Property; quantum; Research; Rice; Semiconductors; Solid; Spectrum Analysis; Structure; System; Techniques; Technology; Training; two-dimensional; UniversitiesOPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY AND CONTROL OF MANY-BODY DYNAMICS IN SEMICONDUCTORS IN HIGH MAGNETIC FIELDS",0.999999,1e-06,2.1623736929362072e-05,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
688,"Dynamic linkage between volcanoes has implications for long- and short-term eruption forecasting. Although such linkage has been suggested to exist for some volcanic systems it remains controversial, as does the underlying mechanism. Recently, the possibility of dynamical coupling of Kilauea and Mauna Loa has been proposed as a consequence of pressure diffusion within an asthenospheric melt zone that underlies both volcanoes, and from which each volcano is supplied with melt, albeit from different parts of it. To test this hypothesis, we propose to construct a numerical model of combined subsurface magma flow and accumulation, magma degassing and volcano deformation. The magma flow model will be based on two-phase flow theory, with magma degassing incorporated from existing solubility and diffusivity formulations for magmatic volatiles. Volcano deformation will be modeled by coupling the flow model with well-established kinematic deformation models through mass conservation. Similarly, changes in magma composition will be estimated from mass balance considerations. Observations of surface deformation, gas emissions and changes in magma composition will constrain the time-dependent magma supply to each volcano. Model results will be used to test for correlative activity and assess potential mechanisms for dynamical coupling. In addition to testing this coupling hypothesis, the model can be used to interrogate the interplay between magma supply, storage and eruptive activity at each volcano, in particular at Kilauea, where the spatial and temporal frequencies of observations are high. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of this proposed modeling approach we will perform an exploration of the unknown parameters the model will include and all the available constraints. We will establish databases of the available geodetic, seismic, geochemical and gas observations, evaluate their completeness and reliability, and ascertain the model uncertainties and trade-offs, assessing the uniqueness of solutions and the statistics of the inverse problem.2013 marked the centennial of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory located on Kilauea, Earth''s most active, and near Mauna Loa, Earth''s largest volcano. Both volcanoes are also two of the best and longest monitored volcanoes and have been instrumental to our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Earth''s mantle, the evolution of volcanic island chains, as well as basaltic volcanism in general. They are thought to be the archetypical manifestations of hot-spot volcanism, caused by a buoyantly upwelling mantle plume that undergoes partial melting at a few hundred kilometers depth beneath Hawaii. Upward percolation and accumulation of this melt results in spatially focused flow through the Hawaiian lithosphere, into magma chambers that are located at a few kilometers depth beneath each volcano, and from which volcanic eruptions are fed. Both volcanoes exhibit complex patterns of activity, including movement along large fault planes that underlie portions of each edifice, with the potential for large earthquakes, tsunamis and triggering of new eruptions. It has been suggested that magma accumulation at depth may itself facilitate movement on these faults. Whether these processes and feedbacks are confined to a single volcano or whether they may also affect the neighboring volcano remains uncertain. Future eruptions, especially from Mauna Loa, have significant potential to directly impact the main populations centers on the island of Hawaii, and an improved understanding of the processes at work within the volcanoes, and any dynamic link between then will benefit public safety through increased understanding of volcanoes and volcanic hazards. This project, which represents a collaborative effort between the University of Hawaii, Rice University and the US Geological Survey, is aimed at integrating a range of different types of observation and will, therefore, impact a number of different fields, including geodesy, seismology and geochemistry.

690,"This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award to Dr. Jonathan M. Jacobs is supported by both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. During the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Jacobs will work on a project titled,  Virulence effectors-triggered production of plant regulatory sRNA as a novel strategy to silence rice immune signaling by a bacterial pathogen  under the sponsorship of Dr. Sébastien Cunnac at the Institut de recherche pour le développment (IRD) in Montpellier, France.Small RNAs (sRNAs) have emerged in eukaryotes as important regulatory players in gene expression of many biological functions including stress responses. The nature of sRNA biogenesis and activity remains heavily underexplored in model systems of important crops such as rice (Oryza sativa) during biotic attack. The aim of the proposed research include understanding sRNA biogenesis and activity in rice upon infection by the bacterial plant pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. This project will employ bacterial and plant genetics and molecular biology to define the mechanisms that govern pathogen-dependent sRNA biogenesis and activity. This research will expand our basic understanding of plant-microbe interactions and host immunity.X. oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial blight of rice, arguably the most important disease of rice worldwide, and the broader impacts of this research include increasing knowledge of a major plant disease on a globally important crop. The fellow will develop strong international connections between the French and US agricultural research community by participating in a multidisciplinary research team at a leading French agricultural research institute. The fellowship training will also include mentorship of students from diverse backgrounds, which will strengthen the fellow?s research program upon return to the US.This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and experimental conditions available abroad.

691,"This action funds Chase W. Nelson of the University of South Carolina-Columbia to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the Genomics Research Center of Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is  The Genetic Basis of Gene Expression Divergence between Rice and Maize: Uncovering the Evolutionary Origin of C4 Photosynthesis.  The host scientist is Dr. Wen-Hsiung Li.This project undertakes a bioinformatics analysis of genomic and transcriptomic next-generation sequencing data from rice (Oryza sativa, a model C3 photosynthesizing plant) and maize (Zea mays, a model C4 plant). Previous work in the Li lab has revealed important gene expression differences between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of maize. These results are being expanded through an evolutionary analysis of the genetic basis of gene expression divergence between maize and rice leaves at early developmental stages. The analysis examines developmental transcription factor (TF) genes to determine whether gene expression differences mainly result from cis or trans effects. Results address the hypothesis that TF genes exhibiting differential expression between these species play important roles in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, an important issue in plant physiology. By facilitating international collaboration, this research will allow the tailoring of new computational techniques to the various methods used in data generation.Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow''s project will achieve several unique broader impacts. The cultural and scientific experiences gained in Taipei will contribute to his role as the BioInvestigations Lab Coordinator at the EdVenture Children''s Museum in Columbia, SC where his duties include informal science education and training staff in basic molecular biology techniques.

692,"This action funds Emily Ruth McCarthy of William Marsh Rice University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Hongik Univeristy in Seoul, South Korea.  The project title is  Improving the Seismic Reliability of Bridges with Innovative Shape Memory Alloy Devices.  The host scientist is Dr. Eunsoo Choi.Within transportation networks bridges are recognized as the most vulnerable links during earthquakes, with associated damage resulting in high repair costs and socio-economic disruption to the affected region. Through the use of innovative shape memory alloy devices, which can be strategically placed within an analytical bridge model, improvements in bridge reliability (i.e. the probability of survival) can be demonstrated for representative seismic events. Many existing methods for enhancing bridges'' seismic resistance focus on developing components that activate in a single directional of motion while the device presented in this work aims to exploit the material''s superelasticity effect to limit detrimental effects due to multi-directional displacements. The superelasticity effect most notably describes the material''s ability to recover large deformations after application and removal of stress. Improved bridge reliability translates into increased public safety and long term reduction of related repair costs. Through fragility analysis, which describes the probability of failure of a system or component given a set intensity measure, the effectiveness of the proposed device to improve reliability is demonstrated.Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the specific benefits of pursuing this research topic relate to improving public safety during seismic events and reducing post-event repair costs related to bridge damage. Additionally emergency responders requiring immediate connectivity between regions need functioning bridges and this maintenance of functionality can be facilitated through the incorporation of shape memory alloy devices in the system.

Although these previous alliances and demonstration projects differed with respect to implementation strategies, they all had a strong emphasis on mentoring. As such, the newly combined Institute for African-American Mentoring in Computing Sciences (iAAMCS, pronounced  i am cs ) will serve as a national resource and emphasize mentoring as the primary strategy for increasing the participation of African-Americans in computing, specifically at the Ph.D. level and beyond. The overarching goal of the iAAMCS is to increase the number of African-Americans obtaining computing sciences doctoral degrees leading to an increase in the number of African-American researchers in the academy, government, and industry. Toward this goal, the iAAMCS Alliance will (1) increase the number of African-American Ph.D. graduates who enter the workforce with a research focus; (2) retain and advance African-American Ph.D. students, faculty and researchers in computing; and (3) develop future African-American leaders with computing expertise in the academy, government, and industry.

695,"Bacterial and fungal pathogens inflict major crop losses. The bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent for bacterial blight of rice, affects yield stability with losses up to 60% in the developing world. Three groups with complementary expertise have identified a fundamental mechanism for plant disease susceptibility involving Xoo-induced expression of sugar transporters known as SWEETs. SWEETs are involved in the translocation of sugars from photosynthetic leaves to roots, pollen, and seeds in uninfected plants. Xoo directly induces SWEET gene expression using TAL (transcription factor-like) effector proteins, which are injected from bacterium into leaf cells. The team has also shown that genetic alterations affecting TAL effector function through genomic editing of the target sequence in the host can be used to engineer pathogen resistance. The team hypothesizes that growth of the pathogen depends critically on nutrient supply from the host, and that Xoo specifically targets sugar release from leaf cells for supplying carbon and energy to the pathogen. They also hypothesize that this mechanism is relevant for other host/pathogen systems. This work lays the basis for engineering robust and broad disease resistance by targeting SWEETs encoded by a family of ~20 genes in rice and other crops. The results are expected to provide insight into durable and broad resistance and have global impacts on the environment and quality of life.The insights gained from this project are relevant to engineering pathogen resistance in rice, but due to the fundamental nature of the mechanism the research may have impact in other crops.

698,"The beaksedges (ca. 375 spp. in tribe Rhynchosporeae; Cyperaceae) are ideal for understanding patterns of diversity and diversification in the three American centers of subtropical/tropical grasslands and savanna because they are one of the most diverse groups in each area. For example, Rhynchospora has the greatest number of taxa (49) endemic to the SE North American Coastal Plain of any plant genus. This study will use ''anchored phylogenomics'' (identifying and sequencing 100s or 1000s of highly conserved anchor regions flanked by more variable regions scattered throughout the genome) to produce a robust phylogeny for ca. 100 beaksedge species that will be used to the timing of diversification of the group and the evolution of fruit morphology, habitat specificity, and C3/C4 photosynthesis.The project will generate a ''toolkit'' for anchored phylogenomics in the monocots, a group of 65,000 species that provides the great majority of the human diet (e.g., rice, maize, and wheat).  Better knowledge of the relationships among these crop plants and their wild relatives is useful in crop improvement. The project will also enable more precise identifications of beaksedge species, which are often only identified to genus in ecological and conservation studies because of difficulties in identification.  This is especially significant because 81 beaksedge species are recognized as wetland indicators in the United States and under-representation of the tribe''s diversity reduces the accuracy of conservation assessments and makes the study of some ecological interactions impossible.  The project will also train a graduate student in phylogenomics, which is emerging as an increasingly important skill set in systematics, biogeography, ecology, and evolution.

699,"This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating high performance mathematical models of bioheat transfer for reliably and accurately predicting and visualizing the outcome of laser induced thermal therapy. Minimally-invasive laser ablation is a medical procedure that provides a means of rapidly delivering heat to target diseased tissue in the body and will be used in this project to kill focal cancerous lesions in brain as well as diseased neurological tissue, such as epilepsy. The translated computing technology has the following unique features: (1) the predictive capabilities of the prototype device will assist in minimizing the surgical impact on the patient and (2) the prototype device will be tightly coupled to existing FDA approved procedures in humans and rigorously validated to assure accurate predictions. This provides exemplary improvement in the efficacy of the procedure as no comparable technology currently exists and the neurosurgeon does not have the capability to a-priori visualize outcomes for complex treatment scenarios (multiple lasers/trajectories) near essential anatomical structures. The project accomplishes this goal by utilizing hybrid multi-core and GPU computing architectures combined with sophisticated mathematical algorithms resulting in a portable, aggressively parallel, medical image driven prototype simulation device. The partnership engages industry (BioTex Inc.) and academic centers (Rice University and MD Anderson) to provide guidance in this minimally invasive neurosurgical market space as well as to commercialize and validate the technology as they pertain to the potential to translate the high performance computing technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to improve treatment effectiveness within the yearly greater than 200,000 brain tumor cases and greater than 1 million epilepsy cases in the U.S. Within a 5-yr timeframe, this will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this minimally invasive neurosurgical market space. The societal impact, long term, will provide novel computational and mathematical tools for improving the safety and efficacy of computer assisted image guided therapy for this important medical application.

700,"This project will investigate how various modes of transport (steady convection and bursty bulk flows/dipolarization fronts) influence the inner magnetosphere and ring current. Observations in the plasma sheet from THEMIS and in the night side radiation belts from the Van Allen Probes  will be used to determine how various transport modes affect local properties of the ring current.  The evolution of energy spectra, pitch angle distributions and pressure will be examined for the different forms of interaction. One goal will be to determine the relative importance of adiabatic and non-adiabatic acceleration. This study will involve multiple events. In separate but related studies IMAGE HENA observations will be used to determine globally evolving ring current and plasma sheet pressures. This will be done by comparing the spectral and spatial evolution of H and O ions during convection and substorms. Finally a 3D particle trajectory tracing code will be used in the time evolving fields from the Rice Convection Model to evaluate non-adiabatic acceleration mechanisms. HENA observations will be used to determine plasma pressures at synchronous orbit and these will be used as input to the RCM. The resulting pressures from RCM will be compared with the global pressures in the ring current region.This research will support a post-doctoral researcher and provide early career development for a female scientist.

702,"Intellectual Merit:Recent developments in nanostructures manufacturing, sensing and wireless networking, will soon enable us to deploy Flow-based Cyber-Physical Systems equipped with sensing and actuation capabilities for a broad range of applications. Some of these applications will be safety critical, including water distribution monitoring (i.e., critical national infrastructure systems particularly vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including contamination with deadly agents) and interventional medicine (i.e., a medical branch that makes use of tiny devices introduced in a living body through small incisions, to detect and treat diseases). The goal of this project is to advance our fundamental understanding, through a robust mathematical framework, of emerging field of Flow-based Cyber-Physical System. The project develops new architectures, models, metrics, algorithms and protocols for optimal sensing, communication and actuation in Flow-based Cyber-Physical System  deployed on-demand (i.e., reactively, when sensing and actuation is needed) or proactively. Flow-based Cyber Physical Systems consist of mobile sensor nodes and static nodes, aware of their location. For stringent requirements (e.g., form factor, cost, energy budget) nodes may or may not possess node-to-node communication capabilities. Due to the lack of localization infrastructure, mobile sensor nodes infer their location only by proximity to static nodes. Sensor nodes are moved by the flow in the network, detect events of interest and proximity to static nodes, communicate and actuate. This research will enable, for example, water distribution monitoring systems to accurately and timely detect events of interest in the infrastructure and to react to these events. It may enable doctors to detect diseases and deliver medication with microscopic precision.Broader Impacts: Ultimately, the outcomes of this research will have impact on CPS that operate in critical modes and environments and control critical infrastructures and medical applications. The results from this research may also foster new research directions in CPS applications. The PI will integrate the research results in newly approved courses on CPS at Texas A&M and disseminate course materials online through the project website and Rice University Connections Consortium. This project will also offer research opportunities to undergraduate students, underrepresented groups, and high school students participating in the Texas Science Olympiad and National Science Olympiad.

703,"Cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa) are staple food for human and animal nutrition. Because cereal growth is limited by nitrogen, the high yields of these crops are currently dependent on fertilizers that are a major on-farm expense and cause significant environmental damages. In view of the increasing demand for higher production of these crops, the development of alternative strategies to enhance crop production while reducing fertilizer use is of high priority. One such strategy is to use rhizobia that form intimate endophytic association with these crops and increase their growth. Rhizobia are soil bacteria that form a very efficient nitrogen-fixing association with legumes. Recent studies have shown that rhizobia hijacked the genetic machinery of legumes involved in symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi. Similar to legumes, rice forms symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi and contain the homologues of legume genes necessary for interactions with rhizobia. Preliminary results from the investigators'' laboratories indicate that a rhizobial strain utilizes the mycorrhizal symbiotic pathway to colonize rice tissues. The goal of this project is to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of both rhizobia and rice that result in this beneficial association as well as to evaluate the potential of rhizobial nitrogen fixation with rice.  This rhizobial-cereal interaction provides a unique opportunity to study the initial relationships and mutual benefits that probably allowed legume nodulation to appear but also, in the long term, to use this system to engineer nitrogen fixation in cereals by following the path of legume evolution. The broader impacts of this project for the education and professional development include the interdisciplinary training for students and postdoctoral fellow that include experience in microbial and plant genetics, molecular biology, microscopy and plant-microbe interactions.

705,"In this project the PI will create a quantitative description of the  gene regulation function , i.e. the variation of the transcription of a given gene with the amount of its regulating transcription factor in individual cells. Specifically, the PI will quantify how gene activity, in the form of the discrete time-series of mRNA production events, is modulated by varying concentrations of transcription factors. The PI will examine three paradigmatic gene circuits of increasing organismal complexity, from bacteria to mammals. To perform these measurements, he will use a synthesis of traditional biochemistry and molecular biology techniques, single-cell fluorescence microscopy, advanced image processing and data analysis algorithms, accompanied by coarse-grained theoretical models and stochastic simulations of the underlying kinetics. A significant intellectual outcome of this project will be the first precise quantitative description of the gene regulation function at the level of individual cells, individual transcription events and absolute numbers of proteins and RNA, in genetically unperturbed systems. This mesoscopic description will provide a bridge between two existing levels of description: the molecular (microscopic) level, at which a wealth of information is available, largely through classical biochemistry and biophysics in vitro; and the macroscopic level of gene-network topologies, obtained mostly through classical genetics, but which lacks any quantitative details on the regulatory interactions between elements. The PI and Dr. Sokac in collaboration with Rice University will provide a one-week wet-lab based teaser course for quantitative undergraduates (Q-students) from math, physics, chemistry, computer science and engineering. The goals of the course are to show Q-students how quantitative methods apply to biology, and encourage them to pursue independent research projects. Q-students will be coached on how to find undergrad research positions in labs at the Texas Medical Center, and once placed, they will receive support from mentors and colleagues in a weekly evening discussion group run by the PIs. Ultimately, the goal is to recruit Q-students to careers in biological research.This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.

706,"The research component in this CAREER award will focus on a series of experimental investigations of melt-rock reaction in Earth''s heterogeneous upper mantle conditions. Partial melting of the Earth''s upper mantle comprising peridotite and recycled crustal lithologies influences the thermal evolution of the planet, geochemical variability of the crust, differentiation of the interior, fluxes of key volatiles to the exosphere, and geophysical properties of the mantle. While isotopic and trace element geochemistry of erupted basalts have long-established the presence of subducted mid-ocean ridge basaltic (MORB) crust and continental sediment at mantle source regions of ocean island basalts (OIB), the identities of plausible lithologic heterogeneities and how such lithologies impart major element signatures on erupted lavas remain unresolved. Experiments thus far have mostly considered direct partial melting of various lithologies and not the reactive processes involving crust-mantle systems that should be ubiquitous in the convecting mantle. This experimental study will explore how subducted crustal lithologies-derived partial melts and peridotite reaction may produce a wide array of magma compositions and hybrid lithologies. These experiments will be conducted with the aid of piston cylinder (PC) and multi anvil (MA) devices, in order to constrain mantle hybridization via (1) MORB-eclogite-derived partial melts and fertile and depleted peridotite reaction, (2) metapelite-derived partial melts and peridotite reaction, and (3) partial melting of end member hybrid lithologies (modally altered peridotite and pyroxenites) produced by MORB/metapelite melt-peridotite interactions. Experiments are expected to span pressures and temperatures over which subducted crusts and sediments are partially molten but peridotite is unmolten. Major element compositions of reacted partial melts and reacted mineral assemblages will be determined as a function of depth, temperature, original crustal melt and peridotite compositions, extent of partial reactive crystallization, and melt-rock ratio. Furthermore, using high precision electron probe microanalysis and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, fractionation of elements such as first-row transition metals, Gallium, and Germanium will be determined with the goal of using these elements, in conjunction with major element equilibria, to constrain the mineralogic and lithologic heterogeneities of the basalt source regions.This CAREER project integrates the PI''s Earth science research and teaching through a range of educational outreach activities, professional and career developments of students, and contributions to the broad field of earth science research. The proposed experiments will generate key data relevant to a wide range of Earth science disciplines including petrology-geochemistry, mineral physics, geodynamics, and seismology. The outreach activities will include a 10-week summer internship for one local community college student typically from underrepresented and minority groups, each year, in the PI''s experimental petrology lab and supporting one high school or middle school teacher every year for a 4-week lesson plans development on solid Earth topics and research experience in the experimental lab. These two outreach activities are in line with the mission of and organized in collaboration with School Science and Technology (SST) Programs of Rice University. In addition, contents and visuals depicting the motivation, concepts, results, and implications of the proposed research will be developed by the PI for the ''Teaching Petrology in the 21st Century'' website, an open-access resource widely used by petrology instructors for both undergraduate and graduate curriculum across the globe. The research performed as part of this proposal will facilitate operation of a new MA lab and will thus contribute towards collection of new MA pressure calibration and assembly data to be shared with the COMPRES (Consortium for Materials Properties Research in Earth Sciences). The generated experimental data on crust-mantle hybridization (with or without volatiles) will contribute towards newer generation thermodynamic, mineral physics, and geodynamic models of mantle materials and processes. Finally, with partial support from Rice, it is planned to engage two PhD students and recruit as many as five Rice undergraduates in order to advance their academic journey and educational experiences.

707,"The objective of this award is to establish a comprehensive knowledge base in network design for the optimal allocation, distribution, and packaging of needed healthcare resources to remote and rural locations, as it pertains to providers, services, and equipment. The developed techniques will be used to increase the scalability of problems solved in this area.  Specifically, the research will develop innovative techniques related to integer programming and mathematical structures called branch decompositions to solve these problems.  To this end, the developed techniques will be compared with other exact algorithms in the literature to validate and assess the computational efficacy of the techniques.If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of healthcare networks for rural and remote locations.  In particular, this research will assist Rice University''s Beyond Traditional Borders program to provide healthcare services within the African country of Malawi.  In addition, this research could also have a significant impact for the some 3800 rural health clinics throughout the United States. More generally, this research will increase the scalability and efficiency of solving associated computationally hard problems related to network design, which have applications in fields seeing increased demand.

708,"PI: Pamela Ronald (University of California - Davis)CoPI: Edward Marcotte (University of Texas at Austin)Collaborators: Roger Wise (Iowa State University) and Jorge Dubcovsky (University of California - Davis)Plants and animals sense conserved microbial signatures through receptors localized to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. These receptors, often called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), typically carry or associate with non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) kinases that initiate complex signaling networks cumulating in broad-spectrum resistance. While it is now widely appreciated that PRRs play a key role in the immune response of plants and animals, little is known about the signaling pathways governing these responses. This is especially true in monocotyledonous species, which are estimated to contain a ten-fold larger number of PRRs as compared to dicots. This project exploits RiceNet, a previously experimentally validated genome-scale functional gene network of rice genes, to explore PRR-mediated immune responses in cereals on a genome-wide scale. Taking advantage of the observation that genetic modifiers of the same gene often cluster in gene networks, novel regulators of PRR-mediated immune responses can be effectively identified and prioritized based on local connectivity in such networks. The project will identify and validate subnetworks (i.e. sets of genes) governing rice, barley and wheat PRR-mediated immune responses, generate a new dataset for rice based on an innovative proteomics approach, and establish a genome-scale functional network for wheat. Results from these studies will lead to major advances in understanding the PRR-mediated immune response of cereal crops. Because pathways controlling PRR-mediated responses in rice are similar to those in other plants and animals, the expected results will be relevant to other species that will serve as a starting point to develop new strategies for engineering resistance in cereal crops. Researchers at all levels, from undergraduate student interns through postdoctoral scientists, will receive essential training in genomics, proteomics, pathology, and systems biology. The project will organize and hold a Networks in Immunity (NetI) workshop that will facilitate collaborations between increasing numbers of researchers in this important discipline. Results will be made broadly available, allowing for generation of novel hypotheses and biotechnological applications, and serve as a basis for comparative genomics studies. All validated interactions will be deposited into central protein-protein interaction databases such as IntAct, MINT, DIP, or bioGRID. All raw mass spectrometry data will be deposited into the Open Proteomics Database (http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/OPD/) and raw proteomics datasets will be submitted to the public repositories PeptideAtlas (http://www.peptideatlas.org) or Tranche (https://proteomecommons.org/tranche/).

709,"All grasses produce spikelets, short branches bearing the florets, which produce the kernels or grain, and therefore much of the calories that feed the world. Maize, and closely related grasses, produce spikelets in pairs, doubling the number of kernels produced in contrast to other, more distantly related cereals, such as rice, wheat and barley, which produce spikelets singly. Understanding the molecular and developmental basis for paired spikelet formation is of great practical significance as this information could be used to double yield in cereals that produce single spikelets. Collaborative comparative genomic studies also provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the molecular basis for the evolution of this derived trait. The identification of the suppressor of sessile spikelet (sos) loci in maize provides a breakthrough into the understanding of the formation of the paired spikelet. Molecular, cellular and developmental approaches will be used to dissect the function of Sos1.  Additional molecular and developmental studies of Sos2 and Sos3 will enable the identification of additional genes regulating paired spikelet formation. The paired spikelet is produced by a meristem called the spikelet pair meristem.  Meristems continually produce organs through balancing the functions of maintenance and determinacy. The Sos loci will enable the dissection of the interaction between these two fundamental developmental processes, as well as providing insight into the evolution of grass inflorescence architecture.This research involves collaboration between a maize developmental geneticist and an expert in the evolution of grasses, and hence is interdisciplinary in nature.

The theme of the workshop is the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics for class groups of quadratic fields, and their recent connections to other areas of mathematics, most notably topology. The organizers of this workshop are Ramin Takloo-Bighash (University of Illinois at Chicago) and Akshay Venkatesh (Stanford). The invited speakers are Thomas Church (Stanford), Jordan Ellenberg (University of Wisconsin), Wei Ho (Columbia), Andy Putman (Rice), Arul Shankar (IAS), Frank Thorne (South Carolina), Jacob Tsimerman (Harvard), Akshay Venkatesh (Stanford), Craig Westerland (Melbourne), and Melanie Matchett Wood (University of Wisconsin).   Class groups and class numbers are of fundamental importance in number theory and have been the subject of intense research since 19th century starting with the foundational works of Gauss. Cohen-Lenstra Heuristics are a series of surprising conjectures that predict the finer behaviors of these objects in the quadratic field setting.  Bringing together experts working in the area will create an environment in which to exchange ideas and to start new projects, leading to a better understanding of these fundamental objects.

It is biochemically similar to another modification, C4 photosynthesis, but requires fewer structural changes to leaf tissue. We know a great deal about the evolutionary history of the C4 syndrome, and this knowledge has informed efforts to genetically engineer this photosynthetic improvement into crops such as rice. We know virtually nothing about CAM evolution- its genetic underpinnings, its relationship to other plant traits, and whether it is equally likely to evolve in all plant lineages. Here the PI proposes to significantly increase our understanding of how CAM evolves, utilizing a comparative approach and focusing on one horticulturally important plant lineage known for drought tolerance, which includes the cacti. The project involves extensive genetic and ecological analyses, and will also develop a new metric to efficiently screen species for low level CAM activity. Because this is a CAREER award, all research goals of the project are tightly interwoven into an innovative education program involving undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers at Brown University, and graduate students from Peru. In addition to the basic scientific understanding that will be gained, this project should yield valuable insight into the use of CAM photosynthesis for engineering more drought-resistant crops. Moreover it will build a foundational bridge of scientific collaboration between the United States and Peru, and contribute significantly to capacity building and scientific training in a developing nation.

713," 3-Manifolds: Heegaard Splittings, the Curve Complex, and Hyperbolic Geometry  is a mathematics research conference which will be held April 19-21, 2013 at Rice University in Houston, Texas. This conference will bring together senior and junior researchers in the above areas of 3-manifolds in order to share recent progress and reflect on the future direction of the subject. It will feature approximately eight research lectures together with an introductory lecture intended for graduate students.  Ample time will be set aside for interaction and collaboration among the attendees.In its broadest terms this project is about the mathematical structure of the  shape  of 3-dimensional objects (topology/geometry). Understanding complex shapes has many diverse applications. The geometric structure of proteins and other complex molecules is crucial to drug development. The geometric shape of organs (especially the brain) is vital to the field of medical imaging. The prediction of shape from incomplete data has important military and commercial applications. The geometric configuration of cellular DNA is vital in determining the precise mechanisms of cellular processes. In the past few decades, topology has experienced fundamental and transformative developments. This conference will fertilize new research directions by encouraging mathematical interaction and collaboration among researchers. The budget will help support the travel expenses of the speakers, and it will provide partial support to graduate students and other young researchers to  enable their participation in this event. Every effort will be made to support and encourage participation from underrepresented groups.

714,"PI: C. Donovan Bailey (New Mexico State University - Las Cruces)Senior Collaborator - Colin Hughes (Zurich Botanical Garden)The extensive application of next generation sequencing in agricultural research has focused on yield improvements in the most important global food crops (e.g., corn, wheat, rice, and soybean).  However, lesser-known crops in tropical systems are also of tremendous significance; yet these receive comparatively little research attention. Several such plant groups are broadly known as  multipurpose crops , often representing key elements in sustainable agriculture that are fundamental to production gains in mainstream crops grown in impoverished regions. One such lesser-known system includes members of the genus Leucaena, which comprises 24 nitrogen-fixing species of small trees and shrubs. The unusually high leaf protein content of Leucaena (particularly L. leucocephala) helped to garner the titles  miracle tree  and  alfalfa of the tropics  and resulted in small- and large-scale plantings reaching 5 million lowland tropical hectares by the late 1980s. These introduced plantations provide: 1) unique protein-rich leaves for animal feed in livestock production systems, 2) green manure used as nitrogen-rich fertilizer for crops and for soil stabilization in alley-cropping systems, and 3) rapidly renewable woody biomass for construction, fuelwood, and even biofuels through lignocellulosic precursors.  The goal of this project is to investigate how plant transcriptomes change through time and in association with diversification of species.  Specifically, a cost- effective and phylogenetically informed approach will be used to sequence, assemble, and compare sets of expressed genes (transcriptomes) from all species of Leucaena. Insect feeding trials will be used to identify genes and broad metabolic pathways associated with psyllid insect resistance and susceptibility among different species of Leucaena.  In addition, the project will use the data generated to investigate broad patterns of transcriptome size variation and identify some of the specific changes that have been associated with speciation through geographic isolation in comparison to hybrid speciation associated with genome duplication (allopolyploidy).  Finally the data generated will be used to develop molecular markers for plant breeding and other studies.Newly developed breeding tools for tropical woody species are critical for future widespread use as contributors to sustainable agriculture in poor tropical regions of the world. NMSU is a minority serving university with existing programs successfully attracting underrepresented individuals to careers in scientific research.  Furthermore, this project includes the implementation of a new course and undergraduate laboratories developed to advance interest and the understanding of plant genome research among students at a Hispanic Serving Institution using a plant system of interest to Mesoamerican culture and heritage.  Support of this MCA-PGR project will provide extensive training and mentoring for the PI, associated postdoctoral fellow and graduate student who will work closely with a primary investigator applying new genomics technologies to address these research questions.  Sequence data derived from this project will be made available through a project website and long-term through the NCBI''s Short Read Archive.

715,"PI: Harkamal Walia (University of Nebraska)CoPIs: Dong Wang, Aaron Lorenz, Ashok Samal(University of Nebraska), Argelia Lorence (Arkansas State University)Collaborators: Mark Tester (Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics), Abdelbagi Ismail (International Rice Research Institute, The Philippines), Susan McCouch (Cornell University)Salinity is one of the major environmental limitations for irrigated agriculture with yield losses estimated to exceed $12 billion dollars annually. Only 17% of agriculture is under irrigation, yet it provides a third of the global food supply. Rice is arguably the most important crop for global food security, but is also the most salt-sensitive among staple cereals. The extent of genetic variation for salt tolerance in rice is largely unknown and under-utilized. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by utilizing newly developed genomic resources in combination with recent advances in high-throughput image-based phenotyping to elucidate the underlying genetic basis of adaptive responses to salinity stress. This project will provide genome-level information that will link genes and pathways associated with physiological responses associated with salinity tolerance in rice. Knowledge derived from this work will ultimately inform breeders as to which alleles present in the vast genetic diversity of germplasm banks can be introduced into elite cultivars for salt tolerance. This comprehensive study of physiological impact of salt stress in rice will be broadly useful for other cereals such as wheat and maize. Both the biological knowledge and the methodologies used and refined during the course of data analysis will be valuable for large-scale biology projects that have significant phenomics and genomics components.Sequence data will be deposited at the NCBI and Gramene. Phenotypic, sequence, and GWAS data will be available via the project website. Image analysis software and scripts will be available upon request. Investigators will develop multidisciplinary active learning modules for undergraduate students in Plant Physiology and Image Analysis courses at the University of Nebraska and at summer workshops for graduate students and predominantly minority undergraduates at Arkansas State University. Development of instructional material based on the research in this project will be broadly useful in both traditional and online learning environments. Six students and postdoctoral scientists will be trained in multidisciplinary research at the intersection of plant physiology, quantitative genetics, bioinformatics and image informatics. Training students in phenomics will fill a void as high-throughput phenotyping is increasingly deployed in industry but not yet available at most public institutions for research and training.

716,"Research and development work at the NSF Engineering Research Center for biorenewable Chemicals (CBiRC) has identified a bio-process for conversion of sugars to fatty acids as a platform technology. The fatty acid synthesis pathway can serve as an extremely versatile platform for the production of a very diverse class of chemicals. Due to rising demand and constrained supply, fatty acids are currently produced from palm or coconut oils. Due to rising demand and constrained supply, fatty acid prices have quadrupled in the last decade and are projected to rise further.  The proposed effort will enable a broad platform for commercialization of various biomass-derived fatty acids and their derived products. Such a platform will cater to many industry sectors including consumer products, nutrition, personal care and polymers based upon carbon chain length of the fatty acids. The proposed effort will focus upon commercialization of C14 and C16 fatty acids.  Technology Holding LLC (small business) and Rice University (CBiRC) have collaborated to develop and commercialize the patent-protected biomass conversion to fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives platform.  The proposed process utilizes patent-pending metabolically engineered E. Coli culture to convert C6 sugars from biomass to fatty acids. The metabolically engineered strains have shown to exhibit extremely promising performance - these strains can produce fatty acids at a fatty acids/glucose yield close to the maximum theoretical value and at good production rate. The goal of the proposed collaboration is to translate the existing ERC platform research into the marketplace by developing a hierarchy of fatty acid and derivative products synthesis based upon yield and market price. The commercialization effort will focus upon:  (1) Demonstrating the intellectual property protected fatty acid based platform technology via scale-up; (2) Rapidly transitioning the fatty acid based platform technology to the marketplace aligned with the translational goal of CBiRC and (3) Creating an economically viable product portfolio from the platform. base; Biomass; Businesses; Carbon; Chemicals; Coconut Oil; Collaborations; commercialization; consumer product; Engineering; Escherichia coli; Exhibits; Fatty Acids; Glucose; Goals; Industry; Intellectual Property; Legal patent; Length; Marketing; nutrition; Pathway interactions; Performance; Polymers; Price; Process; Production; Research; research and development; Rice; scale up; Self Care; sugar; Technology; Translating; Universities; WorkSMALL BUSINESS ERC COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A BIOMASS CONVERSION TO FATTY ACIDS PLATFORM",1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,6.688573343421148e-05,0.999999

719,"The world will need to increase agricultural yields dramatically to meet the demands of the rapidly growing population for food and renewable fuel. The edible parts of several major food plants, including corn, rice, wheat, beans, and peas, undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication in which their cells enlarge and increase their DNA content several fold. Despite its importance, little is known about how endoreduplication is regulated, and it is difficult to investigate in food plants because the endoreduplicating nutritive tissues are buried deep within their developing seeds. To overcome this difficulty, the research proposed will use genetics, cell biology, and genomics to investigate endoreduplication in exposed cells on the surface of the Arabidopsis flower. In this new system, the cells are accessible for experimentation in growing plants. In particular, the research will address the question of how endoreduplication influences the cell undergoing the process. First, a mutant with increased numbers of endoreduplicated cells will be used to elucidate how endoreduplication is controlled. Second, the mechanism through which endoreduplication turns off one gene will be determined. Normally scientists think of external signals turning on and off genes within a cell.  However, exciting recent results suggests that in, at least one case, endoreduplication can turn off a gene. Finally, to find how many genes are turned on or off by endoreduplication, the expression levels of all of the genes in the Arabidopsis genome will be compared between endoreduplicating cells and their non-endoreduplicating neighbors. Findings from this research may show new ways to increase crop yield. In addition, this project will train two graduate students, provide opportunities for summer research for three undergraduate students, and will enable workshops targeted to interest school girls in science.

720,"The vascular system of plants is a network of tubes that functions much like the veins and arteries of animals. However, in plants, vascular cells also are important for structural support, and form during the development of all plant organs. The goal of this research is to learn more about how the vascular system in plants forms, and how it can be manipulated to increase plant productivity.  Both biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to find genes that are important for making the different types of cells that form the vascular system, with the goal of identifying genes that can be manipulated to increase the amount and quality of the vasculature in plants. These genes can then be used to help develop crops that can withstand extreme conditions. In the 1960s, the vigor of standard cereal crops such as rice and wheat were limiting for food production. The creation of new varieties that were shorter and did not fall over as easily led to increased production of grains and averted a major food crisis. Today, as the citizens of the world face climate change with its more volatile weather, an understanding of how the vasculature forms is needed so that they can be manipulated to alter the strength and function of stems and other plant organs in extreme and volatile environments.

721,"Under the supervision of Dr. Stephen A. Kowalewski, Yanxi Wang will conduct an archaeological survey in the Middle Guan River valley in Nanyang, China. This study will map, describe, collect and date artifacts from the earliest human occupation, at least 8000 years ago, up to historic time. The ground surface of the Guan River valley is stable and free of vegetation in the winter months, which allows the project to find and date most of the ancient cities, towns, villages, and temporary camps occupied during its long history. The goal is to reconstruct the settlement and population history. Ms. Wang wishes to understand how China''s agricultural system and rural and urban life developed. This is relevant for understanding the origins and later development of agriculture, urbanization, and land-use and landscape history in the regionThe study area is situated at the geographical transition of millet-growing North China and rice-growing South China. The Middle Guan River valley has received little archaeological attention, considering its rich cultural heritage and its geopolitically strategic location in the development of Chinese history. In contrast to some of the archaeologically better-known parts of China, with loess plains and broad river valleys, the Guan River and its nearby upland hills has a more diverse natural environment, which probably played an important role especially in the early development of the Neolithic way of life - the first villages and the development of an economy based on domesticated plants and animals. The project will use full-coverage pedestrian survey as the major data collection method to achieve the research goal. Regional survey, which is much less costly and more protective of cultural heritage compared to excavation, will help record archaeological sites and environmental conditions, and produce collections of ceramics, stone tools, and other artifact types. This information will be used to create settlement pattern maps by time period. Combined with documentation of historic and modern population, agriculture, and other land-use practices, the survey will provide data measuring prehistoric population size, and assess the temporal changes in the relationship between community, environment, and agricultural economy. The survey will provide information at the appropriate long-term and broad spatial scale necessary to address how human societies responded to the impacts generated by agriculture and maintained agricultural systems from incipient to more intensive and developed stages. Results will be published as a report in Chinese and English, and then a more detailed report in the form of doctoral dissertation. The project will provide valuable but unfamiliar Chinese archaeological data to Western audiences. It will bridge the gap between the research methods and theories in Chinese archaeology and North American archaeology and enhance communication between research institutions. More importantly, it will also help the Chinese and English public learn about the diversity and complexity of ancient China and the past of human society.

722,"PI: Julia Bailey-Serres (University of California - Riverside)CoPIs: Siobhan Brady and Neelima Sinha (University of California - Davis) and Roger Deal (Emory University) From the germination of a seed to the fertilization events that lead to the next generation, plant development is exquisitely orchestrated by genetically determined processes that are fine-tuned by environmental cues. This entails the precise regulation of networks of genes in individual cells over the course of the plant life cycle. This project will decipher the complex regulation of genes within specific types of cells of the plant. This will be accomplished by transfer of methods pioneered by this team in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana to three important crops: rice, alfalfa, and tomato. These technologies allow for the isolation of cell nuclei containing DNA and RNA and the ribosomes that translate mRNA into protein from targeted subpopulations of cells of a leaf, root or other organs, without the need for dissection. The new genetic resources developed will be used to study how development is perturbed by two major environmental threats to US agriculture: drought and flood. The outcome will be a greater understanding of the integration of plant development with environmental cues. The project will have multiple broader impacts. Using parallel multi-tiered and computationally robust analyses, the project will address two important biological questions: How does gene regulation in the stem cells (meristem) of roots and shoots differ across species? How does environmental stress influence the development of specialized cell types in the root? The findings will provide insights that could facilitate downstream improvement of abiotic stress tolerance. It will also generate resources for the evaluation of cell-type specific expression in three important crops. The seed material and data sets will be shared with the plant genome research community through the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/). Finally, the project will engage postdoctoral researchers and graduate students in advanced interdisciplinary training in biology and computational sciences, who will benefit from the experience of mentoring undergraduate students in research. Finally, the project will engage high school students in the classroom and the laboratory, develop teaching tools, and foster greater understanding of the importance of plant research to humankind.

725,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Introduction: Despite an information explosion about antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in bacteria, patients are dying of untreatable infections for the first time since antibiotics were discovered. The main cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in gram-negative bacteria is active efflux of drug by bacterial pumps. Knowing how the pumps are regulated is the key to understanding MDR development: bacteria can become MDR simply by increasing expression of these efflux pumps. Significance: Bacteroides fragilis are ubiquitous gut commensals that cause devastating disease when they escape the gut; their resistance to antimicrobials is rising significantly. In aerobes, MDR is caused by efflux pumps regulated by transcription factors (TFs). We hypothesize that MDR efflux pumps in B. fragilis are similarly regulated by TFs. These TFs, and the pumps they regulate, may also regulate other virulence factors. VA patients are particularly at risk for anaerobic infections. Mortality in Bacteroides bacteremia is high (25- 50%) and liver disease, common in VA patients, is a risk factor for increased mortality. We identified several MDR clinical isolates (including one from a GI in Afghanistan) with increased pump activity; these isolates were resistant to metronidazole and other agents and resulted in one death and one amputation, respectively. Preliminary Studies: In the previous funding period, we identified and characterized the B. fragilis bme efflux pump genes and showed that they were implicated in clinical MDR (described in 23 publications); we found that increases in pump levels and in resistance could be induced by a variety of agents and stressors including antimicrobials, salicylate, bile and quorum sensing molecules. We constructed new vectors and modified them to mimic the molecular tools available for use with aerobes. Research Plan: Our long term goal is to unravel the complex regulation of MDR in B. fragilis. Specifically, our goals now are to: AIM 1: Identify the TFs most important in efflux-mediated MDR (both activator and repressor TFs) using a functional genomic approach. AIM 2: Characterize TFs most important in efflux-mediated MDR. Determine the phenotype associated with the TF, measure MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) and determine the relevant bme genes. Demonstrate binding by physical and functional approaches. AIM 3: Determine the clinical prevalence of TF regulation in efflux mediated MDR. Measure TF transcription levels in clinical isolates, including the recently acquired MDR strains. Determine the effect of TF on efflux-mediated MDR and on ability to form biofilms. Assess the effect of bile exposure on TF transcription levels, MICs and biofilm forming ability. This study takes advantage of our unique resources: expertise with molecular and biochemical approaches, access to a massive collection of clinical isolates and associated MIC data, and excellent collaborative relationships with world-class experts. Once completed, this work, together with the studies already conducted, will reveal important new information about regulation of BF MDR pumps and will greatly contribute to our knowledge of regulation mechanisms in this bacterium that is subject to very different stresses than aerobic pathogens. B. fragilis is an important component of the gut microbiome (which has been called a separate  organ  within the human body) that is recognized as having its own impressive metabolic profile and profoundly affects almost every aspect of human health and disease. In this global environment, there is little time from the emergence of the first MDR strains to widespread resistance. Racing to develop effective drugs when untreatable infections emerge is not a viable public health strategy. Regulators of MDR efflux are important targets in drug discovery; identifying and understanding the TFs that are most important in these MDR organisms will lead to the development of new and effective interventional therapies that target the expression or translation of these factors. abdominal wall; Accounting; Address; adverse outcome; Aerobic; Aerobic Bacteria; Affect; Afghanistan; Amputation; Anaerobic Bacteria; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotics; Anti-Infective Agents; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Antimicrobial Resistance; Area; Attention; Bacteremia; Bacteria; Bacterial Genome; Bacterial Infections; bacterial resistance; Bacteroides; Bacteroides fragilis; Bile fluid; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; biological research; Biology; Businesses; capsule; Cessation of life; Chronic; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Code; Collection; Colon; combat; Communities; Complex; Consensus; cost; Data; design; Development; Disease; drug development; drug discovery; Drug Efflux; Drug resistance; efflux pump; Elements; Environment; Escherichia coli; Explosion; Face; Family; Foundations; Frequencies; functional genomics; Funding; Funding Agency; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic Transcription; genome sequencing; global environment; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; gut microbiota; Health; Healthcare; Homologous Gene; Human; Human body; Individual; Industry; Infection; information gathering; inhibitor/antagonist; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Liver diseases; Measures; Mediating; Medical center; member; Membrane; Metabolic; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Metronidazole resistance; Microbial Biofilms; microbiome; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multi-Drug Resistance; mutant; Nosocomial Infections; One-Step dentin bonding system; Operon; Organ; Organism; Outcome; Outcome Study; Outcomes Research; overexpression; Oxygen; pathogen; pathogenic bacteria; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Phenotype; Predisposition; Prevalence; Probability; Public Health; public health relevance; Publications; Published Comment; Pump; quorum sensing; Race; Regimen; Regulation; Regulon; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Resistance; Resistance development; resistance mechanism; resistant strain; Resources; response; Rice; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; salicylate; Scientist; sensor; Solid; Stress; stressor; Surface; System; Therapeutic; Time; tool; transcription factor; Transcription factor genes; translation factor; Up-Regulation; vector; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Virulent; WorkREGULATION OF BACTEROIDES FRAGILIS MULTIDRUG EFFLUX PUMPS",0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06
726,"In southwest Louisiana there is a need for alternative agricultural production that will provide locally grown products and encourage young people to enter into agricultural enterprises. With an aging (~57.3 years Louisiana) agricultural community there is a need to educate and encourage a younger generation to invest and enter agricultural enterprises. Because of a clay type soil texture, Southwest Louisiana is well suited for rice production. Currently, Louisiana ranks third in total United States rice production. However, with land rent and other resource inputs exceeding rice revenue it is difficult to go into this farming practice. Cow -calf production is well established in southwest Louisiana. Much of this production is part-time and a second income. These operations consist of small herds (~36 head) of crossbred cattle. Many of these producers have not utilized current technologies (i.e. artificial insemination, genetic testing, ultrasound, etc..) to improve their herds. The typical marketing method for these calves is at weaning through local auction barns. If these producers were provided education on the value of genetic testing to improve herd sires and dams and to demonstrate the value of feeding offspring to market weights for local commerce, we could increase locally grown beef and potentially influence younger producers to enter into agricultural enterprises. Utilizing a university operated performance testing facility to collect objective data on bulls, heifers and steers and subsequently disseminate information to potential producers is a means to increase the number of producers and to provide locally grown beef. Also, a university operated performance testing facility offers a site for community outreach, university research, and student experiential learning opportunities.

727,"Drought and salinity are major climate-related risks for sustainable rice production. Designing of abiotic stress tolerant cultivars is needed to enhance food security under future climatic uncertainties. The major bottleneck to accomplish this goal is the narrow genetic base of US rice germplasm, which needs to be expanded through introgression of novel abiotic stress tolerance genes from exotic stress tolerant donors. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop rice prebreeding lines with enhanced stress adaptation and to provide a better understanding of the genetic basis of complex abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms. Several mapping populations developed from crosses involving elite rice cultivars and well-known abiotic stress tolerant donors will be genotyped and phenotyped in both greenhouse and field experiments to discover and validate the genes or chromosome segments responsible for various morphological and physiological attributes conferring abiotic stress tolerance. The abiotic stress related genetic data will be integrated with the genotypically and phenotypically characterized genetic stocks to develop improved pyramided lines through marker-assisted breeding. Advanced breeding materials with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance will embody a significant genetic resource, which will position the public sector rice breeding programs in the US in much advantageous position than ever before to tailor rice varieties to minimize the impact of climate change. Moreover, the genomic and germplasm resources will accelerate large scale discovery of genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms using both map-based and functional genomics strategies in future. base; Breeding; Chromosomes; Climate; climate change; Complex; Data; design; Droughts; food security; functional genomics; Future; gene discovery; Genes; Genetic; genetic resource; Genomics; Genotype; Goals; improved; Maps; novel; Phenotype; Physiological; Population; Positioning Attribute; Production; programs; Public Sector; research study; Resources; Rice; Risk; Stress; stress tolerance; UncertaintyWIDENING THE GENETIC BASE OF US RICE GERMPLASM THROUGH INTROGRESSION OF NOVEL ABIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCE GENES FROM EXOTIC DONORS",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,0.03506883576420458
728,"On highly acidic soils (pH &lt; 5), a form of aluminum, Al3+, is dissolved into the soil solution from clay minerals These toxic Al3+ ions inhibit root growth and function and damage root systems, resulting in reduced crop yields due to drought and mineral nutrient deficiencies. Over 50% of the world&#39;s potentially arable lands are acidic, making this problem a major constraint to crop production, particularly in the developing world. The development of cultivars adapted to acid soils is therefore a key aspect in sustainable crop production. To achieve the full genetic potential in breeding crops for aluminum (Al) tolerance, it is critical to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of this trait. Rice is the most Al tolerant cereal crop, providing a good model to identify Al tolerance genes, and offering the potential to identify novel tolerance mechanisms. The goal of this research is to enable the development of crops with superior performance on acid soils, based on a comprehensive understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying Al tolerance, the genetic variation in key Al tolerance genes, as well as how this variation contributes to the variance in rice Al tolerance. In this proposal, we will build upon the results of our expiring NIFA grant to: 1) Understand how natural variation in the sequence of a major rice Al tolerance gene, whose gene name is ART1, can be exploited to enhance rice Al tolerance. This work will identify versions of the ART1 gene that are most effective at enhancing Al tolerance, and may determine the best combinations of the most tolerant versions of ART1 in combination with the best rice genetic backgrounds. 2) Identify novel, cell wall-related Al tolerance genes and mechanisms, as our preliminary finding suggest that the very high Al tolerance in rice is due in part to curently unidentified Al tolerance mechanisms that protect the cell wall of growing root cells from toxic Al. 3) Translate our recent findings on a novel rice Al tolerance mechanism conferred by a transporter that moves toxic Al from the cell wall into root cells where it is sequestered in an internal cellular compartment. There is great promise for transferring this tolerance mechanism into other economically important cereal species such as corn, wheat and sorghum. This research on rice and other cereals should have immediate and practical applications in agriculture for increasing cereal yields on the acid soils that comprise large parts of the world&#39;s lands, inclduing the southeastern United States and many developing countries in the tropics and subtropics.

730,"Cross-pollination between genetically modified crops and local wild relatives, or gene flow, may create fitness-enahncedweedsthat combine the wild with transgenic characteristics to exacerbate weed problems in agriculture. Seed dormancy, a key adaptive trait controlled by genes, disseminates germination across seasons, making weeds persist in agro-ecosystems. This project aims to develop a transgenic mitigating (TM) strategy to reduce the risk of gene flow by linking to a primary transgene with RNA interference (RNAi) structures to silence seed dormancy genes prevailing in weeds. Because of the linkage with reduced dormancy or increased germination uniformity, transgene-containing weeds would be less persistent in the soil seed bank and also relatively easy to eliminate by agronomic practices. The seed dormancy genes SD7-1, SD7-2 and SD12 cloned from weedy  red  rice will be used to design the silencing structures, which will be ligated with the herbicide resistance gene Bar on the same vectors to transform a rice cultivar. Transgenic lines will be selected to cross with isogenic lines for the dormancy genes to determine the silencing effects under controlled conditions. Selected transgenic lines will be also crossed with weedy rice to evaluate fitness of the transgene-containing weed genotypes under field conditions across generations. Expected outcomes include new knowledge about the efficacy of the TM approach inthe rice crop system, techniques that could be extended to or modified for the other crop systems to prevent the rising of fitness-enhanced weeds, and purified transgenic materials that will be disseminated for in-depth analysis of gene flow.

731,"This proposal will address the risks associated with TALEN-based genetic engineering in crop plants. The hypotheses underlying this work are that TALENs, fusion proteins of TAL effectors and the DNA cleavage domain of endonuclease FokI, are capable of introducing precise, targeted genomic modifications in crops and that the TALEN constructs can be completely removed through genetic segregation. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate, as a proof-of-concept, that TALENs can create site-specific gene changes and intended phenotypes in rice and that the transgenes are undetectable by PCR in the modified genomes after genetic segregation. Thus, our experiments are designed to assess the broad applicability of TALEN technology to polyploid switchgrass and to use the rice model to thoroughly assess potential unintended genotypic and phenotypic effects of TALENs, as well as the unequivocal removal of TALEN transgenes from the modified genomes. We will use whole-genome sequencing to compare the genome of wild-type rice with those of rice mutants that have undergone two rounds of TALEN-mediated gene editing, to identify and quantify potential risks associated with any promiscuous activity of TALENs and residues of TALEN transgenes in the modified rice. Finally, developing a better assessment of the TALEN-associated risks will provide a broad foundation for future crop engineering efforts directed at genomic modification in rice, provide comprehensive insight into the applicability of TALEN technology to other crop and bioenergy plants, and assist federal regulatory agencies in determining whether TALEN technology merits either an exemption from regulatory oversight or a less rigorous regulatory process.

732,"The worlds human population is expected to surpass nine billion by 2050. At the same time, arable land, clean water and phosphate fertilizers are increasingly limited resources, the productivity gains of the Green Revolution are leveling off, the costs of using fossil fuels to transport fertilizer and food around the world are becoming prohibitive, and climate change will affect crop range and productivity in ways that are not yet predictable. To meet this new challenge, society needs inexpensive and sustainable approaches to improving productivity--not only of the major commodity crops like wheat and rice, but also local crops of all kinds, especially in areas of rapid population expansion, namely in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Fortunately, the field of plant-microbe interactions has entered an era of particular promise and has the potential to provide innovative and highly adaptable approaches to increasing plant productivity. Microbe-plant partnerships improve plant resistance to many kinds of stress, including disease, drought, salinity, limited nutrients, and extreme temperature. Advances in the fundamental understanding of natural relationships between plants and the microbial world can be put to immediate use to sustainably increase the productivity of almost any crop. The AAM, the organizer of this colloquium, is the honorific leadership component of the American Society for Microbiology, the worlds largest single life science organization with nearly 40,000 members. The AAM is composed of leading scientists in all subspecialties of microbiology elected on the basis of outstanding contributions to basic, clinical, and applied microbiology. By convening a group of 20-25 world experts on plant-microbe interactions, the AAM will facilitate the dvelopment of a report that answers the following questions: The following questions will be the focus of the colloquium: 1. Why are plant/microbe interactions important 2. What are the currently known general categories of plant/microbe interactions 3. How do plants and microbes interact with one another 4. What kinds of roles do microbes play in plant growth, development, and productivity 5. What kind of stresses, both biotic and abiotic, can microbes help plants withstand 6. What are some examples of cooperative plant/microbe interactions that could be used, or are already being used, to provide agricultural benefits 7. What are the most significant gaps in our understanding of plant/microbe interactions, specifically with respect to agricultural production 8. What new tools, methods and/or approaches might be used to address the gaps identified in question #7 9. In those examples of plant/microbes interactions that have been successfully implemented, what factors were important in their implementation The resultant report will serve as an introduction to the potential of this field, and a roadmap for future research.

733,"Auxin plays an essential role in crop production in regulation of reproduction, shoot and root growth and response to biotic (pathogens) and abiotic (drought, temperature, salt) stress. Moreover, application of auxin is indispensable for horticulture and tissue culture and auxinic herbicides have long been important in weed control. Although much of the basic research on auxin is being conducted in Arabidopsis, this research is on processes of importance to crop productivity. For example, in the root, auxin controls primary root elongation and lateral root initiation, in the shoot, auxin controls branching and during reproductive development, auxin controls anther fertility, carpel structure and fruit development. Auxin plays a critical role in seedling establishment due to its control of the response to light, gravity and shade. Auxin is also a key player in the response to abiotic stress. Auxin levels increase with increasing temperature and auxin is also involved in the response to drought and salt stress. There is a significant amount of auxin research being conducted in crop plants, such as maize, soybean, rice, tomato and grape, which will also be represented at the meeting. For example, auxin regulates fruit development in tomato, nodulation in soybeans, tuber formation in potato and ear development in corn . Research on auxin is also relevant to the biofuels industry as auxin controls vascular development and plays a significant role in wood formation in trees Therefore, research on auxin is highly relevant to crop productivity and sustainability in the US. These research areas will be discussed at the meeting as invited talks, posters, and talks chosen from submitted. The purpose of this meeting is to bring together researchers from the US, Asia, Australia and Europe to dissect the mechanism of action of this critical plant hormone.

Molecular and genetic resources for rice have grown in recent years, starting with two genome sequences, extensive gene knockout populations , plus fast-neutron or chemical mutagen-mediated deletions. A deep collection of accessions of domestic and wild rice is available (>200,000). Most recently, numerous groups have been re-sequencing rice genomes to identify SNP and structural variation. Thus, molecular understanding of rice is arguably the most advanced of any cereal or grass crop.

735,"Our studies seek to provide insight into the origin of phytochromes in photosynthetic eukaryotes - the organisms responsible for conversion of light energy into chemical energy that sustains all animal life and fuels the machines we use daily. Over a billion years ago, a blue-green alga (cyanobacterium) was domesticated by an ancestral host cell that served as the progenitor of nearly all eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms on earth. This process required the host genome to capture algal genes needed for regulation of the photosynthetic organelle known as the chloroplast. In flowering plants, phytochromes function as such a master regulator. The presence of phytochrome-related genes in more primitive plants species indicates that the genesis of this light sensor was critical for the successful domestication of cyanobacteria. While the light-sensing region of phytochromes is clearly derived from this cyanobacterium, the origin of the regulatory domains involved in the translocation of light-activated phytochrome into the nucleus is unknown. Comparative analysis of phytochromes from extant distantly related species is expected to give us new knowledge into the novel regulatory domains harnessed by the cyanobacterial phytochrome photosensory domains and the processes that they regulate in these organisms. Such basic knowledge has already lead to development of new tools for light-dependent regulation of important cellular processes in plants, and also hold great potential for applications in agriculture, medicine and bioengineering. Novel phytochrome genes discovered in the previous grant period are being used to develop plant-derived, antibiotic-free genetic selection markers to produced new varieties of agronomically important plant species. These studies hold great potential for improving yield, flowering behavior and agronomic performance of food, fiber and energy crop plant species such as rice, alfalfa and canola. The human population is estimated to reach 10 billion before the end of this century while the amount of arable land is not expected to increase proportionately. These issues are further compounded by climate change that threatens agronomic performance of plant varieties suited to their local environment at rates faster than conventional breeding can compensate. Climate change is further exacerbated by the reliance on fossil fuels for energy and the concomitant release of greenhouse gases. The toll of rising costs of energy and increasing urbanization will elevate food prices that will fuel famine, disease and political unrest throughout the world. While there will be no easy fix for these problems, it is inevitable that agricultural biotechnology will play a key role in sustaining and increasing crop yield on the limited arable land. We therefore anticipate that basic knowledge gained by our studies and their application to agricultural improvement will play a significant role therein.

736,"Three technically distinct lines of investigation are included under this project. The first, related to the textural quality of canned peaches, falls in the category of postharvest biology/processed food quality attributes. Consumers who purchase canned peaches expect the fruit to retain some of the flesh firmness that is found in fresh, ripe fruit. The softening most fruit display as they ripen is often correlated with changes in cell wall structure; more specifically a change in pectin polysaccharide associations with other wall polymers, often due to the partial breakdown of pectin polymers. Work on this part of the project will use several standard techniques for analyzing the pectins from firm fruit and fruit that have softened in an attempt to determine which step in the processing protocol contributes to the softening phenomenon. This information will guide efforts to modify procedures so that softening is reduced/eliminated. The other studies in this project are linked to recent national efforts to identify economically useful ways to generate plant -derived liquid fuel supplies (e.g., biofuels). The techniques to be used differ because the starting plant materials differ, as does the utility of the available information about the cell walls of rice plants and CHLORELLA algae. We know that rice cell wall structures include cellulose microfibrils that are coated with polysaccharides called xylans. Currently the cellulose is considered the best target for a biofuel  starter  source because cellulose is composed of glucose (an easily fermented sugar) and cellulose digesting enzymes (CDEs) are available. However, the xylan limits the ability of CDEs to work. First, the xylan must be removed, economically, if possible. We have expressed a gene encoding a xylan-digesting enzyme in rice and have techniques to determine if the xylanase can digest the xylan after the grain has been harvested and the rice straw residue has been collected. We will test ways of managing the harvested straw so that that the xylanase will act to strip the xylan away from the cellulose so that CDEs can act. The  algal  biofuel project is different because CHLORELLA cell wall structural data are much less developed than data for rice cell wall structure. However, the presumption behind the approach we are taking is that once we identify key linkages in the CHLORELLA wall we should be able to identify enzyme(s) that is/are capable of catalyzing sufficient wall disassembly to permit economical collection of the starch and/or lipid that has been accumulated in the algal cells. Ultimately this information could lead to (1) the addition of commercial enzyme preparations to harvested algal cultures or (2) the identification of genes encoding algal wall-digesting enzymes and then the expression of those genes in transgenic algae in a way that will allow the triggering of gene expression in the cells at an appropriate point in the algal culture cycle. In either case, the resulting algal wall breakdown will facilitate the collection of starch and lipid molecules that can be used for biofuel generation.

737,"Photosynthesis is fundamental for agricultural production of food, phytochemicals, and biomass feedstocks. This project will focus on maximizing CO2 capture and conversion of photosynthate into starch under rising atmospheric CO2 and limitations in water availability. One objective of this project is to study the feasibility of transferring the biochemical and developmental traits of C4 plants, which can tolerate higher temperatures. Specifically, the biochemistry and developmental aspects of unusual plants belonging to the Chenopodiaceae family will be studied to understand how they are able to carry out C4 metabolism in a single cell (rather than a process which is divided between two cells in other C4 plants which requires specialized anatomy). Additional studies will be carried out in rice to determine the efficiency of CO2 capture by this C3 plant and whether C4 traits can be transferred into this cereal. A second objective is to increase the yields of plants such as rice. Starch accumulation during grain development is very sensitive to temperature and efforts will be made to engineer the starch regulatory enzyme ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase for up-regulatory, heat tolerant properties. Mutations in this enzyme will be introduced using recombinant DNA techniques and mutations evaluated by their capacity to accumulate glycogen in bacteria and by kinetic analysis of the purified mutant enzyme. AGPase genes expressing mutant AGPases will be transferred into rice and its effect on rice productivity and yields evaluated. Similar efforts will also be conducted with poplar, a bioenergy feedstock.

738,"Our research addresses key information needs to guide avian conservation and wetland restoration efforts in California while promoting wildlife-friendly agriculture. Our studies on the agronomic benefits of providing habitat for waterfowl in the rice-growing region of the Sacramento Valley illustrate the compatibility of agricultural practices and wildlife habitat objectives. Our research has provided the necessary information to establish realistic acreage goals for wetland conservation efforts, including key winter and breeding habitats. We are developing new management techniques to maximize the quality and productivity of existing wetland habitats. Our focused studies on several species of breeding and wintering waterfowl have identified key limiting factors for these populations and have facilitated the development of management programs to ensure the long-term sustainability of this key natural resource in the agricultural landscape of California. New and continuing projects focus on (1) evaluating the efficiency of alternative moist-soil management practices on seed production in Central Valley wetlands to provide food for waterfowl and other waterbirds; (2) assessing the effect of land use and agricultural practices on dispersal, recruitment and population dynamics of wood ducks to maximize the success of wood duck breeding programs and to evaluate agricultural impacts on riparian systems; (3) determining the factors limiting production of mallards in California to develop sustainable harvest objectives for this important game species and to evaluate habitat restoration efforts for breeding waterfowl; and (4) examining the genetic structure of several species of waterfowl in the Pacific Flyway to determine the appropriate units for the management of these species based on their biological and evolutionary histories, rather than on arbitrarily determined geographical boundaries.

739,"Ovules are the precursors to seeds - the primary food source for humans and livestock, and the primary means of crop propagation. Genetic and biochemical methods have been used to identify and characterize molecular events responsible for regulation of ovule development. These studies will be continued to identify additional genes involved in this process. Information gained from these studies in a model system will be utilized to study similar processes in selected agronomic plants. Rice and tomato have seeds that differ significantly from those of the model species studied, with differences especially notable in the seed coat. The seed coat of tomato contributes to fruit quality and seed stability and pathogen resistance. Rice seeds are protected within a hard outer capsule and the role of the seed coat is not known. The studies will help identify the functions of the seed coat in this critical agronomic species. Our work has also determined the basis of formation of seedless fruit in the tropical sugar apple (a relative of cherimoya). We will work to enable US access to seedless sugar apple and to facilitate the best methods of introducing the seedless trait into cherimoya, an emerging crop in California. Overall, the work has the potential for application in improvement of seed and fruit crops and to facilitate crop propagation.

740,"Rice diseases are the major threat for stable rice production and food security worldwide. Deep understanding of the disease resistance pathway in rice is essential for effective control of the diseases. We use rice as the experimental plant to understand the molecular basis of host resistance to pathogens because rice is the lifeline for about half of the world&#39;s population and the model plant for cereal crops. Although rice contains many E3 ubiquitin ligases, the function of their substrates in immune responses is still not fully understood. We previously characterized U-box E3 ligase SPL11 in rice that is involved in the regulation of programmed cell death (PCD), immune responses, and flowering. However, how SPL11 interacts with its substrates to control cell death and immunity is not clear. Recently, we found that the SPL11 interacts with SPIN6, ubiquitinates, and degrades the protein via the 26S proteasome pathway. Both the Spin6 RNAi and mutant plants show enhanced resistance to rice pathogens and activate defense gene expression and ROS generation. Importantly, we found that SPIN6 is the RhoGAP of the small GTPase OsRac1, which is a key component in rice immunity. Our study provides further insights into the relationship between SPIN6 and its interacting proteins SPL11 and OsRac1, and its function in the control of cell death and immunity in rice. advanced system; Arts; Bacteria; base; Biological Assay; Blast Cell; Cereals; Country; defense response; design; Development; Disease; disorder control; Food; food security; fungus; Genes; Goals; high school; Host Defense; Infection; interest; Laboratories; literate; Magnaporthe; Mediating; Mentors; microorganism; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Natural Immunity; next generation; novel; novel strategies; Oomycetes; Oryza; outreach; Pathogenesis; Plant Model; Plants; Postdoctoral Fellow; Production; protein protein interaction; protein purification; Proteins; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Personnel; Resistance; Rice; Role; Science; Scientist; skills; Staging; Students; System; Techniques; Training; Ubiquitination; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Virus; vpr GenesFUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF NOVEL E3 LIGASE GENES INVOLVED IN DEFENSE RESPONSE TO MAGNAPORTHE ORYZAE IN RICE",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06
741,"The purpose of this project is to use biotechnology to improve crops. There are four research focuses. First, we will continue to provide our plant genetic transformation expertise and services (maize, soybean, rice, and Brachypodium distachyon) to the public researchers in plant science community nationally and internationally for their efforts in functional studies of plant genes. Our transformation services as a public research infrastructure and the efforts in improving the transformation efficiencies will further enhance public research productivities in plant sciences. Second, we will produce corn and soybean seeds that can accumulate reasonable levels of double stranded small RNAs (dsRNA) that can be used as vaccine for cultured shrimps. The seed-based dsRNA vaccination system is attractive, because it can potentially produce large quantities of dsRNA in materials that is a key component of shrimp feed. Currently there is no report on plant-based dsRNA vaccine. This research, if successful, would represent a significant advance in plant expression capacity for non-protein molecule as vaccines for a variety of veterinary and human pharmaceutical applications. Third, we will explore novel technologies that can be used for effective genome editing and engineering for plants. The novel strategies will allow for precise insertion or recombination in targeted DNA sequences, which can prevent any cell toxicity and undesired side effects. This new methodology will help to address the current societal and regulatory concerns regarding crop improvement using transgenic approach. Fourth, we will conduct basic research in understanding potential regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil bacterium that has been used as a plant genetic transformation tool for its natural ability for delivering DNA into plant cells. This type of knowledge is currently not available because the research of ncRNAs in bacteria is still new. Unraveling the functions of Agrobacerium ncRNAs will have a potential to further our knowledge in pathogen-plant interaction processes.

742,"Leaves are the major photosynthetic plant organ and are critical for plant productivity. In cereal crops, plants with more upright leaves can be planted at high density, allowing for increased yields. The purpose of this research is to examine the role of the plant hormone brassinosteroid in the development of leaves in several plant species. A major focus will be on understanding structures in the rice and maize leaf that regulate leaf angle. This knowledge will aid in the development of higher-yielding crop varieties.

743,"Weather shocks are an important source of losses for farmers. With climate change, these shocks are becoming both more extreme and more frequent. With more crowded countrysides and smaller farm sizes in developing countries, a same weather shock now has larger welfare consequences. Costs to farmers of exposure to weather shocks are in both managing risk in anticipation of weather shocks, and in coping with risk once shocks have occurred. As we have become better informed about the consequences of vulnerability to shocks, what we have learned is that the a majority of today's chronic poor eventualy fell into poverty as a consequence of exposure to shocks and the costly responses to risk coping. Vulnerability to shocks and lack of protection against these shocks is thus one of the main sources of poverty and of the reproduction of poverty over time. With nearly 75% of the world poor related to agriculture, this is a huge issue that deserves attention, especially as new instruments to reduce vulnerability to shocks do exist under the form of technological and institutional innovations. There are in particular two innovations we will be analyzing that have potential to reduce vulnerability to shocks. The first is improved crop varieties of for example for rice and corn that are more resilient to extreme weather events. Two on which we will immediately focus our research are flood tolerant rice (SwarnaSub1) and drought tolerant rice (Sahbhagi-Dhan), both developed by the International Rice Research Institute and being rolled out in Asia. Similar work is being done for maize drought tolerance in Africa, especially South Africa and Ethiopia. These new varieties could have large impacts on behavior and welfare. However, the determinants of their adoption is not known, and the precise nature of the expected impacts has not been observed. The second innovation is index-based weather insurance, that has the potential advantage of avoiding the pitfalls of classical insurance where payments are based on the assessment of damage. With index-based insurance, payments are based on weather triggers such as deficits and excess rainfall, high winds, and extreme temperatures. These are measured at the level of meteorological stations without the need for damage assessment at the level of individual farmers. Yet, in spite of promise, this new insurance product has hardly been adopted without expensive subsidies. The large impact that this institutional innovation could have in reducing vulnerability to shocks is thus still largely unrealized. We are exploring how to adjust this insurance product to make it more appealing, in particular by designing the contract for groups such as cooperatives as opposed to individual farmers. Field work on this is in progress with coffee farmers in Guatemala. We expect to also do field work in Mongolia where an index-based weather insurance for livstock has been in place for more than five years, with yet unknown results. &#8195; Adopted; Adoption; Africa; Agriculture; Asia; Attention; base; Behavior; Chronic; climate change; Coffee; Contracts; coping; cost; Crowding; design; Developing Countries; Droughts; Ethiopia; Event; Exposure to; extreme temperature; farmer; Farming environment; Floods; Guatemala; improved; indexing; Individual; innovation; instrument; Insurance; International; Learning; Maize; Measures; Mongolia; Nature; payment; Poverty; Reproduction; Research; Research Institute; response; Rice; Risk; Shock; Social Welfare; Source; South Africa; Time; Weather; WorkREDUCING VULNERABILITY TO WEATHER SHOCKS THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS",1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,0.9940015325763123,1e-06,0.999999
744,"Increasing rice grain yield and quality is important to rice growers and consumers. The sugars produced from the products of photosynthesis must be transported to the grains to produce harvestable yield as rice grain. A critical limitation on yield, as well as quality, is the capacity of rice grain to import sugars, produce starch and fill grain. This combined import of sugars and production of starch within the developing grain is called grain filling. The primary sugar imported in rice is sucrose while the largest end product within the grain is starch. In rice, we have found that grain quality is reduced when nighttime air temperatures are above 22 degrees C. Consequently, we seek to understand which enzymes involved in filling rice grain are most impacted by high nighttime air temperatures. The goal of this work is to develop a meaningful understanding of how high nighttime air temperatures impact rice grain filling and how this leads to lower rice quality. The potential value of that increased understanding is to identify means to exploit that understanding to produce cultivars of rice which resist high night temperatures better than currently available cultivars.

745,"This project is designed to characterize interactions among soilborne pathogens and soil edaphic factors that impact losses from soilborne pathogens on major row crops in Arkansas. The soilborne pathogens that affect major row crops in Arkansas have wide host ranges and thus are common to many crops. Within these pathogen groups, there is a large diversity of species or subgroups that may affect the disease observed as a result of their aggressiveness and interactions within other members of the genus or with other pathogens that form disease complexes. A number of these soilborne pathogens cause diseases in the seedling stage on cotton, soybean, and rice reducing plant stands and delaying early-season plant growth. Soilborne diseases also may develop later in the season resulting in significant losses. One of the most important diseases on soybean and rice in Arkansas is aerial blight and sheath blight, respectively, caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA. The environment is an important component of disease development for soilborne pathogens. Among abiotic factors that are important are soil temperature, water and texture. Control approaches differ depending on the crop and pathogen. The proposed research emphasizes soilborne diseases of row crops because these diseases are a major constraint to initial stand establishment and crop productivity. Aspects of soilborne diseases which need to be examined include the diversity and interactions among soil populations of these pathogens and the role of soil physical, chemical, and biological factors and cultural practices. The objectives of the project include: 1) characterize the community structure of selected soilborne plant pathogens as it relates to cropping practices and soil edaphic factors; 2) elucidate the role of soil edaphic factors, including soil texture, temperature, salinity, and water, and cultural practices on pathogen survival and disease development; 3) examine interactions among sub-specific groups and different genera of plant pathogens on plant disease development; and 4) quantify the spatial relationship and movement of selected pathogens within fields. Understanding the importance of soil factors and cultural practices influencing pathogen populations and disease development will aid in targeting fields or portions of fields that are most likely to suffer disease losses and thus when additional control strategies need to be applied. Understanding these associations also may allow the more effective use and precision application of fungicides. Other benefits of this project include the characterization of populations of the pathogen that may interact to increase disease or moderate the severity of disease and the adoption of cultural practices or other strategies that take advantage of these associations. Results from these investigations will be integrated into pest management systems to minimize the risks of specific pathogens causing diseases and improve profitability and environmental quality.

746,In this project technical identification guides (in the form of traditional paper publications) and semi-technical online resources are being developed to allow recognition of important pest planthopper species. Online resources (on the Planthoppers of North America website) include genus-level webpages with photos and lists of available technical resources that will assist pest identification efforts of experts and non-experts alike. Identification tools for native species not known as pests are important because such tools allow subsequent re-evaluation of pest status when such species are found in agricultural settings or recognition of invasive species by process of elimination. Specimen data compiled from natural history collections will be initially visualized on  Discover Life  (and subsequently elsewhere once technical haring issues are overcome).

747,"This proposal addresses national and global concerns about environmental pollution and energy security. Coal accounts for 42% of the electricity generation in the US. Burning coal to generate electricity produces large amounts of coal combustion wastes, CCW. Coal combustion wastes can contain toxic substances that are linked to cancers, neurological and birth defects in humans. Nearly sixty percent of CCW generated annually in the US is composed of very fine materials known as fly ash, FA. Currently, FAs are generally stored in massive wet ash ponds, or they are shipped to designated landfills. The historic Kingston TN Fly Ash Spill of 2008 was caused by failure of the containments at such wet ponds at the Tennessee Valley Authority coal plant. One reason for failures of containment systems is the old age. The site of the Kingston ash release has accumulated ash sludge since 1952. An urgent need exists to address disposal of FA. Well recognized, biologically based strategies collectively called bioremediation and phytoremediation, using microbes and plant systems, respectively, currently exist for cleaning up a broad range of wastes. However, they have not been systematically evaluated for FA disposals because FAs are not classified as wastes according to US solid waste regulations. This proposal seeks to extend bio- and phytoremediation to cleaning up FA contaminations. Our own programs have long studied and implemented these strategies for mitigating land degradation using native grasses such as switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, big bluestem and Indian grass. These grasses can be used this way because of their high biomass productivity even under harsh conditions. The same grasses are at the forefront of the current intense debates on bioenergy as one strategy for reducing global dependence on petroleum fuels. Accordingly, our current proposal will not only clean up environmental pollution by FA but also, biomass produced during the process will be used as feedstock for biofuel production. Despite their reputation as sources of hazardous chemicals, FAs also contain major and trace elements that are essential for plant growth. Additionally, they can improve water retention and storage characteristics of soils when they are used as amendments for plant growth. Beneficial utilization of FA as soil amendment has been thoroughly documented by investigators from India, the greatest FA producer in the world. In that country, FAs have been used to grow a variety of food crops including rice, corn, legumes and sugar cane. Such use of FA has been proposed in the US, the third largest producer of FA, but less than one percent of the product is used in this way. This may be changing. According to the USDA Deputy Administrator, wise management of CCWs by industry and new beneficial uses will minimize the quantities of CCWs that must be disposed of and sequestered long-term in landfills and impoundment ponds. Our proposal to turn waste to energy feedstock production is an emerging strategy in the current focus on energy security and environmental sustainability.

748,"In 2011, the Economist magazine published an issue entitled  The 9-billion People Question  which addressed a world-wide dilemma that is central to most if not all plant scientists - How can our society grow enough food to feed 2 billion additional human beings in less than 40 years Rice (Oryza sativa) will play a key role in solving the 9BPQ as rice feeds half the world and it is that half that will double in size in the foreseeable future. One of the most important resources that can be utilized to improve cultivated rice is the virtually untapped reservoir of genetic variation hidden within the wild relatives of Oryza. The genus Oryza spans approximately 15 MY of evolutionary history and is composed of 21 wild and 2 domesticated species, 10 distinct genome types, and a 3.6 genome size variation. Wild Oryza species have a broad habitat distribution, including Asia, Australia, Africa, South and Central America, and many novel biotic/abiotic resistances have been identified. This project will help to lay the foundation for a complete genomic interrogation of the wild relatives of rice. Here we propose to generate: 1) Genome Framework Datasets (physical maps) for O. glumaepatula, O. meridionalis, and L. perrieri; 2) Chromsome 3 short arm sequences for the same 3 species, plus O. granulata; 3) Reference Sequences for O. barthii and O. punctata; 4) baseline transcriptome/small RNA datasets for 11 diploid Oryza species, plus L. perrieri; and 5) population datasets for the same set of 12 species in #4. These primary datasets will first be baseline annotated, and then used to address a number of fundamental areas in comparative genomics including: 1) Structural Variation; 2) Phylogenomics; 3) Population Genomics; 4) Genome Evolution & New Gene Origination; and 5) the Role of Transposable Elements in Genome Evolution. All of this data and analysis will be used in support of an international effort to generate reference genome sequences for the all 23 species of the genus Oryza under the rubric - the International Oryza Map Alignment Project (I-OMAP). This information will in turn be used to gain biological insights and to identify agriculturally important genes and can be used to help solve the 9 billion-people question. Additionally, this Hatch Project will be used to support the Arizona Genomics Institute by: 1) continuing to maintain and strengthen AGI's capabilities to remain a competitive world class plant genome center; 2) continuing to develop BAC-based fingerprint/BES framework physical maps for important crop plants; 3) developing and implementing methods to rapidly and cost effectively sequence plant genomes utilizing next generation sequencing; and 4) developing and implementing robust informatics pipelines to efficiently and effectively process next generation sequence data.

749,"Less arable land and high energy costs mean that agricultural production must become more precise in order to be sustainable in the 21st century1. The overarching goals of this Hatch Project may lead to outcomes that partially provide solutions to these problems. We aim to (i) develop and characterize rice transgenic lines that may grow in sub-optimal environments and (ii) reduce the fiscal cost associated with intensive farming tomatoes without affecting productivity. Our efforts will focus on rice (Objective 1) and tomato (Objective 2). Rice is the staple for one half of the world's population but it is very salt-sensitive. By 2050, 50% of all arable land will be saline 10, making the availability of salt-tolerant rice advantageous. The work here could lead to potentially new stress-tolerant transgenic rice with stable yields. Functional information may make it easier to recreate this phenotype by conventional breeding. Furthermore, how salinity affects rice plant growth and rice grain eating quality will also be explored2. Rice is the 3rd most important crop in terms of farm gate receipts to Yolo county11 and most is exported to Japan where all users along the supply chain place a high premium on grain sensory attributes 12,13. Rice quality is largely determined by the crystalline structure of the starch granule12 and feedback on changes to these parameters due to genetic or environmental conditions are necessary for end-users. We will produce this data from our work. Tomatoes are one of the most popular fruits globally14 and California is a premiere tomato production region worth close to US $1B15. Like most intensively farmed crops tomatoes require high N-supplementation and the N used for global agriculture incurs costs of US $900 M globally16. The transgenic tomato germplasm is proprietary to Agricultural Companies with local operations and so our work may aid their efforts to characterize the lines. Our experiments on tomato plant response to elevated CO2 are designed with the recognition that CO2 is the major greenhouse gas. In 2007 ~29 billion tons were released into the atmosphere and this estimate may climb to 34.5 billion tons by 202017. Manipulation of soil N and atmospheric CO2 in transgenic tomatoes may directly lead to higher yields, improved sustainability and profitability. Furthermore, it may present powerful tools to dissect the regulation of the underlying molecular mechanisms that affect plant productivity.

750,"Nitrogen (N) is an important element often limiting plant productivity in natural and agricultural ecosystems, making N inputs an integral part of crop production. Paradoxically, nitrogen is also readily lost through processes such as leaching and denitrification in soil environments. Heterotrophic denitrification, where soil organic carbon is the sole electron donor, has been studied for some time with little recognition for coupling with other elemental cycles. Recent studies have emerged, showing a strong coupling between the iron (Fe) and nitrogen cycles. During soil iron(III) reduction to iron(II) as organic carbon is respired, the resulting iron(II) can serve as an electron donor during nitrate reduction. This process is called nitrate-dependent iron(II) oxidation and has been shown to occur in agricultural soil slurries, rice paddy soils, and aquatic sediments. In our lab, we have shown that this process can occur in both moderately well-drained and well-drained Kentucky soil, yet, the factors involved, and the contribution of this process towards overall nitrate reduction are unknown. Accordingly, the overall goal of this study is to investigate nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation under anoxic conditions in five soils of the Memphis catena. This research will help unravel the interrelationships between soil chemical and biological processes controlling the fate of nitrogen fertilizer in soil under anoxic conditions. The results from this research will benefit farmers and the general public on several fronts. Because the important soil factors involved in nitrate-dependent iron(II) oxidation will be identified, this will allow us to predict nitrate reduction and aid in timing and efficiency of fertilizer N applications. Better utilization of N fertilizer will benefit both farmers and the general public because water resources will be protected from elevated nitrate levels and nitrous oxide release to the atmosphere can be better predicted and minimized. Furthermore, soil samples will be studied from the Memphis catena, an important group of soils in the agricultural region of western Kentucky.

751,"Rice is the third major crop in Louisiana with gross farm value of $412 million in 2010. Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world feeding the majority of world population. As the world population is projected to reach 9 billion by 2050, the rice production ought to be increased proportionately to satisfy the growing demand. However, traditional breeding with incremental yield increase has been hitting a historical limitation, and an innovative approach is required to increase the rice production substantially. A promising new approach described here is by control of cytokinin metabolism to enhance the reproductive shoot development and consequently to increase the final grain yield in rice. Truly innovative and novel features of this proposal are that the rice yield improvement could be realized by increasing the strength of sink (seed) (its capacity to make use of the fixed carbon) rather than by increasing the strength of the CO2-fixing source (leaf). We propose to introduce the double mutation to the rice genes OsCKX2 and 5 of the high-yielding Louisiana cultivar Cocodrie by gene-silencing technique. Double mutation of OsCKX2/5 could have increased the grain yield of Cocodrie substantially. Cytokinin, a plant growth hormone, plays a central role in control of virtually all phases of plant growth and development, in particular of the shoot vegetative development and reproductive differentiation into seeds. Mutant phenotypes of cytokinin degradation enzyme (cytokinin oxidase CKX) and of cytokinin-activating enzyme (cytokinin phosphoribosyl hydrolase) indicates the regulation of concentration and spatial distribution of bioactive cytokinin plays a pivotal role in the increase in panicle size, in the numbers of floral organs, and eventually in seed yield. The increased cytokinin content due to double mutation of AtCKX3/CKX5 caused 55% increase in seed yield in a model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We propose a hypothesis that a similar but distinct molecular mechanism might function in rice, a monocotyledonous model crop plant.

The five major food crops (corn, wheat, soy, sorghum and rice) in the United States generate about 300 million tons of lignocellulosic crop residues as byproducts every year. These byproducts currently have limited use. These abundant and low cost ($50-$80 per ton) agricultural byproducts are renewable and sustainable without the need for additional natural resources. It has been demonstrated that lignocellulosic byproducts such as corn stover, rice and wheat straw can be used to obtain high quality fibers suitable for textile, composite and other applications (Reddy, 2005, 2006, 2007; Huda, 2008). Cellulose from these lignocellulosics can also be used to generate regenerated cellulose fibers (rayon) or it can be utilized as reinforcing agent or filler to plastics and resins. Similarly, biofuel production from cereal grains generates abundant carbohydrate and protein containing coproducts that have limited applications. For instance, more than 10 million tons of distillers dried grains (DDG) are generated every year and DDG has a selling price of less than $130 per ton, much lower than the current selling price of common thermoplastic polymers such as polypropylene and polyethylene (> $2,000 per ton). It has been demonstrated that coproducts of biofuel production such as distillers dried grains (DDG) can be used to develop thermoplastics (Hu, 2011a,b). Developing biobased products from agricultural byproducts and coproducts as well as wastes has the potential to increase income from the crops while benefits the farmers and biofuel industries economically and reduces our dependence on petroleum based resources. The new value-added products will increase income from crop production, help to establish small businesses and create new jobs leading to economic benefits. Similarly, biobased products can replace synthetic polymers based products and benefit the environment. Adding value to the coproducts of biofuel production will help to reduce the cost of biofuels and make biofuels competitive to fossil fuels and reduce our dependence on foreign sources for energy. This multi-state proposal provides an opportunity for experts in biobased products to collaborate synergistically and develop unique biobased products. Without such an effort, it may be difficult to commercialize biobased products, improve income from agriculture, reduce cost of biofuels and have a sustainable and economically competitive biobased industry. Similarly, methods to conserve energy and water and develop novel technologies to treat textile waste water will help to reduce cost of textile processing and pollution and help to make the textile industry environmentally friendly. This will give a competitive edge to the US textile industry and, in addition, will potentially save billions of cubic meters of water.

753,"All major field crops, including soybean, corn, sugarcane, rice, winter wheat, grain sorghum and cotton are produced in Central Louisiana. Communities of arthropod pests attack these field crops, thus increasing production costs and decreasing yields. For example, yield losses and management costs associated with insect pests in Louisiana soybean were estimated at $66.91 per acre in 2011. Because of continuous changes in arthropod pest problems, management technology, and regulations, the goal of this research project is to refine pest management in major field crops, with a focus on the Central Louisiana region. This research project will evaluate the efficacy of current and experimental management tactics for field crop arthropod pests. The role of weed management and plant drought and salt stresses in the severity of arthropod pest problems in Louisiana soybean will also be determined. In addition, this research project will monitor populations of the invasive Mexican rice borer and assess their potential negative impacts on Louisiana corn and grain sorghum. Results from this research project will assist in developing improved crop production practices in Louisiana.

754,"We plan to identify important molecular processes limiting plant growth associated with cereal starch biosynthesis. Specifically, we will test transgenic rice lines over expressing leaf, seed, or both leaf and seed starch biosynthesis, as well as wild-type and leaf starch knockout rice for alterations in transcripts and metabolites. Metabolites and transcripts associated with differences in physiological measurements will be identified throughout the photoperiod as well as throughout development. Our objectives will address the degree to which leaf and seed starch biosynthesis control whole plant growth and productivity. There are many advantages to the proposed experiments. First, we have shown that leaf starch biosynthesis is an important contributor to crop yield, as maize plants lacking leaf starch have significantly lower seed yield under agronomic conditions. Second, we have further data indicating that native leaf starch levels limit plant growth, as over expression of leaf starch biosynthesis in rice modifies whole plant processes resulting in increased plant biomass. Furthermore, we have shown that increased expression of starch biosynthesis in seeds of wheat and rice, results in increased plant biomass and seed yield. Additionally, we have the expertise to conduct all experiments and the experiments will be conducted in an agronomically relevant crop. Finally, these studies will be the first to comprehensively address key molecular processes limiting plant growth associated with starch biosynthesis.

755,"Rice systems are unique from other agricultural systems in a number of ways. Most rice is grown in flooded soils. Flooding soils, however, alters soil chemistry which impacts the production of greenhouse gases (GHG) and nutrient use-efficiency. Given the significance of rice it is important to develop management practices that are able to maintain high yields while at the same time minimizing adverse effects to the environment and optimizing its positive benefits. The broad issues of water use, nutrient use efficiency and GHG are all important drivers of the long-term sustainability of rice systems. Furthermore, these factors are all interrelated. For example, how one manages water affects nutrient use efficiency, water quality and GHG production. Over the past 10 years, my research group in rice agro-ecosystems has focused on how to maximize rice yields in an efficient way. Straw burning has been largely replaced with incorporating straw which then led to a reduction in the rate of fertilizer-N input and improved water fowl habitat. Alternative seeding practices are being explored that reduce herbicide use. Questions are addressed how straw and fertilizer management practices affect the quality of run-off water, in particular water soluble organic compounds, a key concern when the water is subsequently used for drinking water. The ultimate goal is to produce rice with the least environmental impact without jeopardizing the economic livelihood of rice farmers. One key component of a comprehensive framework on sustainability is the emissions of GHG. Currently, there is only limited information available on the annual amount of GHG emitted from rice fields as most GHG measurements are taking during short periods in the spring and early summer. This may give inaccurate estimates of GHG emission when extrapolated across the year. The two main GHG of interest are methane and N2O. As N2O is about 10 times more potent than methane, reducing N2O emissions could have a large effect on reducing the greenhouse gas warming potential from rice fields. However, management practices that reduce methane emissions will likely lead to an increase in N2O emissions and vice versa as they are controlled by opposing conditions related to the availability of O2. Here we propose to develop an annual GHG budget for methane and N2O in wet and dry seeded fields. Wet and dry seeding are the two primary means of establishing rice in the US and they differ substantially in terms of early season water management and thus the potential to emit GHG. I am a strong believer that the value of the research findings is controlled on how well the findings are applicable and implemented. Therefore, the research is conducted in farmer's fields to reflect farmer's management practices.

756,"Transposable elements are fragments of DNA that can move from one site in the genome to another and often increase their copy number in the process. The focus of this project is on basic and applied research on transposable elements (TEs), which were first discovered in maize and are now known to comprise the largest component of all sequenced plant (and animal) genomes. The plants studied in this project focus on members of the grass clade, which are the most important source of calories for the human diet. However, because TEs are ubiquitous in all genomes, the findings from this project will inform studies of all crops grown in California, including all fruit and vegetable species. TEs create a significant fraction of genomic diversity, which is responsible for differences in gene expression patterns within a species. For example, they frequently insert into gene regulatory regions where they alter the tissue specific pattern of expression or the activation of transcription in response to stresses such as drought, salinity or cold temperature. In addition, because TEs are themselves induced by a variety of stresses, they are uniquely suited to increase the frequency of mutation when a population is most in need of generating diversity to survive. As mentioned above, TEs comprise the majority of all characterized plant genomes where they generate significant diversity. However, because the vast majority of TEs in all plants and animals are no longer active, it is difficult to determine how a population senses danger and responds by rearranging its genome. It is for this reason that this project focuses on a few closely related rice strains where a TE called mPing is actively amplifying throughout the genome and generating diversity right before our eyes. These studies are important to California because we are particularly interested in understanding how TEs generate diversity that allows plants to adapt to climatic extremes such as temperature, drought and salinity. This proposal also seeks to increase science literacy in the plant sciences. Specifically, we have developed and are expanding the Dynamic Genome courses to involve incoming UCR freshmen in the excitement of authentic research experiences through the analysis of TEs in plant genomes. As such, UCR freshmen will be introduced to the excitement of plant research and obtain the cutting edge tools necessary to continue in research throughout their college career.

758,"Fusarium, Phytophthora and Magnaporthe are two of the most important genera of plant disease-causing microorganisms. Confounding solutions to the problems they case, which range from Fusarium Head Blight of wheat and barley to late blight of potato, is our lack of knowledge about their global diversity, and a lack of available tools that catalog and organize what we do know about it. This project seeks to provide 1) a DNA-based classification and identification system for Fusarium and Phytophthora diversity using molecular phylogenetics and 2) data and basic information about the fungi via the internet that is useful for frontline researchers dealing with problems caused by these organisms.

759,"Need for the project: Grains, principally rice and wheat, provide the majority of calories in the diets of people worldwide, ranging from 23% in the U.S. to 62% in Asia and North Africa. Yet yields for wheat and rice remain 15-30% below their biological potentials even when grown in ideal soils and climates using ideal irrigation and cultivation practices. Production of hybrid seed, which could close this gap, is not economically feasible for most major world crops including rice and wheat. In crops that are grown as hybrids, such as corn, high yields occur in the first season only. Hence, seed companies must produce hybrid seed every year, a process costing approximately $1 billion annually in the U.S. for corn alone. Additionally, the floral anatomy of wheat and rice prevents most seed companies from commercially producing hybrid seed of these crops. Such seed could be produced commercially if these plants were engineered to produce their seed clonally. Certain wild plants possess this capacity, including blackberries, dandelions, St John&#39;s wart, crab apples and Kentucky bluegrass. These plants are essentially high-yielding natural hybrids that pass hybrid vigor on to succeeding generations by asexual seed formation (apomixis). Apomixis does not occur in major world crops. One of our goals is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of apomixis in wild plants. A second goal is to engineer crops with genes that may induce apomixis so that hybrids of these crops pass their hybrid vigor on through succeeding seed generations. This could make hybrid seed production feasible for essentially all crops. Methods and evaluation plan: Eight to 10 species of putatively sexual and putatively apomictic Boechera will be collected. Mode of reproduction will be evaluated cytologically by analysis of at least 50 appropriately staged ovules per species, to determine mode of embryo formation (milestone, Dec 2015), and by flow cytometry of at least 200 seeds per species, to determine mode of endosperm formation (milestone, Jun 2016). Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of apomictic reproduction will be evaluated by sequencing small and large RNA pools from appropriately staged ovules of sexual and apomictic species and by identifying consistent differences among modes of reproduction in these RNA. These studies will provide information concerning the putative roles of genetics and epigenetics in the evolution and regulation of apomixis (milestone, Dec, 2017). Functional analyses of identified candidate genes will then be conducted by up and down regulating them transgenically in model species and in crop plants, the results of which may enable the engineering of crops that possess the agronomic impacts of apomixis as outlined above (milestone, Jun 2018).

760,"It is an unlikely coincidence that one of the world&#39;s highest-yielding crop species (Zea mays, commonly referred to as  maize ) is also one of just a few agricultural plants that possess the C4 pathway of CO2 assimilation. C4 plants exhibit exceptionally high rates of photosynthesis and are more drought-tolerant. The latter trait could become even more desirable in coming years if some of the more dire predictions pertaining to climate change come true. The essential features of C4 photosynthesis are presented in Figure 1. Of prime importance to this proposal, C4 plants such as maize owe their success to a highly compartmentalized acceleration of the central C3 biochemistry common to all photosynthetic organisms. A bold strategy, embracing a broad international effort, for achieving a quantum leap in global agricultural yield is introduction of C4 photosynthesis into a major C3 crop plant such as rice (Oryza sativa) [von Caemmerer et al. 2012]. Continued growth in understanding of C4 physiology and biochemistry can inform these efforts. The mechanism of CO2 concentration is an example of a delicate balancing of aspects of energy metabolism which forms the basis for the superior performance of C4 photosynthesis. Another aspect pertains to photorespiration (Fig. 1). Although rates are low in C4 plants, photorespiration does occur and indeed the capacity for this process is essential to survival of maize under current atmospheric conditions. The photorespiratory substrate, glycolic acid, is synthesized in maize leaves. The potential importance of photorespiration in C4 photosynthesis was not appreciated until recently. Mutational loss of the enzyme glycolate oxidase which catalyzes the first step in the metabolism of glycolate results in accumulation of this organic acid and eventual death of the plant (Zelitch et al. 2009). The object of this proposal is to characterize the influence of external factors on glycolate levels and rates of accumulation in maize. Specifically, the Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to establish a link between glycolate and photosynthesis, identify alternative sources if present, and set the stage for evaluation of this metabolite as a regulator of gene expression during leaf development. If glycolate were to be identified as a gene regulator the implications for rational design of more efficient photosynthetic systems would be significant.

761,"Bacterial panicle blight, caused by the bacterial plant pathogen B. glumae, is a chronic rice disease problem in the rice fields of the southeastern United States. Large yield losses from the outbreaks of bacterial panicle blight have been experienced especially in the growing seasons with prolonged high night temperatures and drought conditions. In spite of the economic importance of the disease, little is known about the virulence mechanisms of the pathogen and the host-pathogen interactions determining susceptibility and resistance. Moreover, there is no effective disease control measure for bacterial panicle blight. Three major objectives will be achieved in this project. First, the regulatory system governing the virulence factors of the pathogen will be characterized via molecular genetics and genomics approaches. Second, the differential rice responses according to the disease resistance will be observed at the genome level. Especially, cutting-edge high-throughput DNA sequencing technology and computational tools will be applied to the research activities for the first and second objectives. Finally, new methods for controlling bacterial panicle blight will be sought using bacteria that are antagonistic to the pathogen and chemicals that induce rice defense systems and/or have bactericidal activities.

The low-moisture foods implicated in these outbreaks include peanut butter, flour, chocolate syrup, powdered infant formula, raw almonds, dry seasonings, and children&#39;s snacks made of puffed rice and corn with vegetable seasoning. Although foodborne pathogens do not grow in these foods, they can survive for long periods of time. Thus, there is a critical need to minimize the risk of foodborne pathogens in low-moisture foods by incorporating a lethality step in the production process.

763,"Rice is the staple food for more than a third of the world&#39;s population. Rice is a major crop in parts of the southern US and California. Rice provides energy and nutrition in the form of carbohydrates and some proteins and lipids, as well as calcium, iron, phosphorus, and vitamins B1 and B2. Therefore, rice is important to many people. Rice is grown in a variety of environments, including rain-fed lowlands, irrigated lowlands, coastal wetland, and even uplands. However, the common feature is that rice needs considerable amounts of water. Drought has increasingly been a major factor in reduction of yields of rice and other crops. For example, in 2012 the US Midwest experienced the most severe drought since the 1950&#39;s, which resulted in water limitations on Texas rice farmers. We have discovered that a particular signaling system in rice, the heterotrimeric G-protein signaling cascade, can be manipulated to improve rice drought tolerance. The goals of the present research are to understand the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon, thereby providing fundamental knowledge that can be used to develop improved varieties of rice which will yield better under drought stress conditions.

764,"Rice blast is the most important disease of rice worldwide, and is caused by the filamentous fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. Common to many other plant infecting fungi, M. oryzae elaborates a specialized infection cell, the appressorium to infect its host, which is mediated by signaling cascades. These cascades involve a series of protein phosphorylation events mediated by protein kinases that relays information from the cell surface to the nucleus. In other work, we discovered that polyubiquitin and an F-box E3 ligase (Mgg_13065), an enzyme that adds ubiquitin to specified proteins and targets them for degradation, are essential for appressorium morphogenesis and pathogenicity; however, it is not currently known which proteins are targeted and how the process is regulated. An important feature of Mgg_13065 and other LRR containing E3 ligases is that they bind to phosphorylated forms of their substrates. Since signaling cascades and Mgg_13065 are required for normal infection structure formation, we hypothesize that (some) proteins including those phosphorylated by these signal pathways may be targeted for ubiquitination by Mgg_13065 to modulate their activity. Evidence is growing for extensive cross talk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Indeed, preliminary analyses of cells undergoing appressorium formation reveals extensive evidence of proteins being both phosphorylated and ubiquitinated. To date, there has been no comprehensive study examining the relationship between ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Thus, in this proposal in addition to defining the global changes in protein ubiquitination patterns and proteins targeted by Mgg_13065 during infection related development, we will examine the extent to which proteins targeted for ubiquitination by Mgg_13065 require phosphorylation by cAMP and or MAPK signaling pathways. This will be accomplished through state of the art protein mass spectrometry, immuno-enrichment strategies, protein-protein interaction analyses and signal pathway mutants. Results from this study will not only provide new insight into the mechanisms regulating infection structure formation, but may enable novel strategies to block the infection process and thus prevent disease.

765,"PROJECT SUMMARYThe gastrointestinal tract (GI) is the most crucial system of our bodies because it serves as a means to provide all the nutrients our bodies need for efficient functioning. The GI tract also houses billions of symbiotic bacteria that are crucial in food digestion and elimination. This also means that it is subject to invading pathogens that most often are kept at bay by the stomach secretions and our robust immune system. However, recently we have begun to see a rise in a number of GI disorders that vary from minor indigestion to more severe diseases like Crohn&#39;s disease, Inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, celiac disease, gastric cancer, intestinal cancer and colon cancer and therefore a rise in human suffering.Our bodies respond to acute infections in the form of an inflammation. Acute innate inflammatory responses are beneficial because they allow us to develop an effective immune system. However, chronic inflammation is never good because the invading agents tax our immune sytem by affecting genes that regulate cell growth, cell proliferation, cell-cell communication and apoptosis. All these parameters, are a part of the underlying causes of the more serious diseases such as cancer.Here, we propose to determine the anti-inflammatory properties of fractionated blueberry extracts and rice callus suspension culture on human intestinal cell lines. Our previous studies demonstrated the anti-cancer activity of rice callus suspension culture and blueberries have been shown to contain phenolic compounds with anti-oxidant activity.

766,"To cause diseases in crop plants, fungal pathogens deliver diverse virulence molecules, known as effector proteins, into plant cells. Because the delivery of effector proteins is a fundamental process in diseases, an understanding of the underlying process may lead to novel strategies to control diseases. Based on our previous research, we proposed a model describing two sequential processes that the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae; a major pathogen of rice, wheat, and other crops) uses to deliver effector proteins into the cytoplasm of living rice cells: the fungus secretes effector proteins into the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), a localized structure formed at the fungus-rice cell interface, and then, BIC-targeted proteins are subsequently translocated into rice cells. In this project, we will validate the proposed model and will provide cellular and molecular basis of effector delivery. We will develop live cell imaging-based assays to identify features in known effector genes and proteins, which mediate the delivery of effector proteins into host cells. Using fluorescence microscopy, we will determine how effector proteins are produced and whether BIC-targeted proteins are translocated into rice cells. The structure of BICs will be determined at high resolution using electron microscopy.

767,"We have recently discovered that genetic variation for the number of root cortical cell files (CCFN) in maize is associated with substantial variation in the metabolic costs of soil exploration, and thereby root growth, water acquisition, and yield under drought. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate and develop this trait as a tool to improve drought tolerance in maize and eventually other crops. Specifically, we will: 1. Confirm the physiological utility of CCFN for root growth, soil exploration, and water capture from drying soil in controlled environments. 2. Identify genes underlying natural variation in CCFN and develop stocks that will support mechanistic assessment of its regulation and utility. 3. Evaluate the utility of CCFN for drought tolerance in the field in rainout shelters in PA and a field research facility in AZ. Defining and understanding traits enhancing drought tolerance is of considerable importance for keeping American agriculture competitive while ending world hunger, as well as adapting to climate change, two of NIFA&#39;s grand challenges. CCFN could be an entirely new tool for improving drought tolerance of crops. In addition to drought, CCFN may be useful in the acquisition of limiting soil nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. While this project focuses on maize, we have observed variation for CCFN in rice, sorghum, and common bean, so this trait may have broad utility. This project therefore addresses novel scientific issues that are of demonstrable relevance to human welfare.

768,"The proposed project, addressing NIFA Program Area Priority A3141, presents a unique interdisciplinary collaboration to address fundamental questions critical to the continued improvement of field-based rice production strategies and applied plant breeding under climate variability, while offering natural extensions to current-day applications in other fields such as agricultural economics, crop insurance, and risk analysis. The fields covered by the team of PI/co-PIs on this proposal (PI: Susan McCouch, Rice Genetics and co-PIs: David Lobell, Climate Science; Anna McClung, Rice Breeding; Joshua Woodard, Agricultural Economics and Finance; Lew Ziska, Crop Physiology) span a wide range of disciplinary expertise and experience, allowing us to reach out to broad range of audiences with this study.U.S. rice offers a unique model system within which to link the disciplines of genetics and physiology, climate change, risk analysis, and economics. The described project is the first study to our knowledge that attempts to model the relationship between genetic variation, yield, and weather using market data. Because rice also serves as a model organism for crop plants, results from this study may have wider implications for new strategies and approaches to studying the relationship between genomic signatures and climate resilience in other major cereal crops such as maize and wheat.

770,"Chronic tissue inflammation and microbial imbalance in the human colon are associated with metabolic diseases and certain cancers. Whole-grain rice products, particularly those from pigmented rice varieties, provide a rich reservoir of functional molecules that can promote improved colon health if their consumpton in the diet is increased. In this project we will isolate specific molecular components (called oligosaccharides and phenolic polymers) that are largely immobilized within insoluble plant fiber. These components may have beneficial antioxidant and anti-inflammation activity as well as ability to stimulate beneficial microbes in thecolon. We will test rice bran components for these activities, in combinations, using laboratory bioassays to determine if they have additive effects. This will give us new knowledge for how these food components may modify the complex interactions between the microbes in the colon and colon mucosal cells. Ultimately, our research will support development of new rice bran and whole rice products enriched with these functional components for consumption by U.S. consumers to reduce the incidence of diet-associated diseases.

772,"AvrRxo1 is a protein secreted from several important bacterial pathogens of plants. In one important rice pathogen, it is important for disease on susceptible plants and resistance on plants that have the Rxo1 resistance gene. The target and function of AvrRxo1 is not known, and neither is the way it evolved, but answering these questions would greatly improve our understanding of the plant-pathogen interaction and aid in development of resistant crops. AvrRxo1 has similarities with an ancient family of  suicide  proteins from bacteria; the bacteria use these proteins to kill members of the population in times of stress. Our study will find out whether AvrRxo1 is related to these suicide proteins, and use the similarities that we find to try to find the target of AvrRxo1 activity in yeast and bacteria. We will use genetics, biochemistry, and microscopy to determine which pathways and targets AvrRxo1 might be modifying in bacteria, yeast, and plants, and to find out how this modification contributes to AvrRxo1&#39;s affects on these organisms.

773,"The long term goal of the proposed research is to increase cereal agronomic yield. This goal may be achieved through further understanding of how source and sink strength influence plant yield. Source leaves are those that are net exporters of sugars obtained through photosynthesis and sink leaves are developing leaves using imported sugars for growth. Here we focus on starch, as it is an important metabolite in both sink and source strength. Starch biosynthesis in the endosperm drives seed sink strength, whereas leaf starch is an important contributor of source strength and thus plant growth as excess photosynthate is stored as starch during the light period and remobilized during the dark period. This project is focused on understanding the importance of both leaf and seed starch biosynthesis in terms of metabolic, transcriptomic, and developmental factors currently limiting plant productivity in order to improve plant production. This may be achieved by improving utilization of energy for synthesis of organic molecules. Our studies are focused on determining the role of both seed and leaf starch biosynthesis to overall plant productivity with the aim being to identify ways to select for improved plant yield.

774,"The proposed research will examine the ways that producers utilize agricultural institutions. It will focus on a subset of institutions: government-mandated marketing institutions (commissions, councils and marketing orders), contracts, cooperatives and industry associations. The specific goals are to categorize the services that these institutions provide for producers and how the benefits are influenced by the set of available institutions, understand the constraints producers face in utilizing these institutions, and identify the factors affecting producers&#39; institutional choices. There has been little attention in the literature to producers&#39; choice of a portfolio of institutions, the linkages among institutions that influence their benefits, or the cost of constraints on producers&#39; choices, including those due to the existence of mandatory institutions or the non-existence of voluntary institutions. The novel contribution of our research is to address these topics. We will construct a theoretical institutional choice model and apply it to two commodities: stone fruit and rice. These industries have different agro-physical environments, demand determinants, and access to commodity support programs. We will survey producers and estimate an empirical model of institutional choice for each industry. This research will benefit producers, consumers and policymakers by identifying determinants of institutional viability and stability. This will provide insight into how policymakers and institution leaders can improve institutions to benefit producers and, potentially, consumers.

775,"Rice blast disease is the most important threat to global rice production. Recent rice blast epidemics have occurred in China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and the United States. In a time of increasing rice prices (resulting from elevated demand due to population growth and compounded by rising fuel costs), the annual loss of up to 189 million tons of grain to Magnaporthe oryzae infection is an additional burden few rice-growing populations can afford. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, rice yields must increase 38 percent by 2030 to meet the demands of the growing human population - left unchecked, rice blast will clearly put serious constraints on the feasibility of this increase being met. Moreover, climate change is likely to increase the incidence and severity of rice blast. Ominously, it is precisely the destructive power of rice blast that has raised concerns about the attractiveness of M. oryzae to terrorist groups intent on disrupting global food production. Considering blast resistant cultivars of rice have a field life of only two to three years before resistance is overcome, the identification of the biological processes by which M. oryzae causes disease is paramount to the search for durable control strategies. Despite this, once M. oryzae gains entry to the rice leaf, little is known about how the fungus suppresses or evades the host response or how the development of infectious hyphae is controlled in the plant. To attempt to narrow this gap in our understanding of rice blast biology, this project will generate and characterize mutants of M. oryzae that are impaired in their ability to adapt to the rice cell environment in order to reveal new information about the mechanisms governing the rice-fungus interaction. This work is expected to reveal important insights into the genes required for mediating plant infection and the cellular processes with which they are associated. In addition, this project will determine how metabolism is integrated with cell signaling to allow successful adaptation of the fungus to host rice cells, and it is expected to shed new light on how these signaling pathways could be disrupted to prevent disease. Taken together, such knowledge is vital to identifying candidate anti-blast targets and developing sustainable control strategies for this devastating disease.

776,"Objective(s): The overall goal of this research is to reduce the impact of abiotic and biotic stresses on the quality and productivity of grasses that serve as the basis for livestock production, turf, and bioenergy.   Objective 1:  Improve grass germplasm by developing molecular and biological resources that can be applied to reduce the impact of abiotic stresses on the productivity of grasses used for livestock production, turf and bioenergy.  Sub-objective 1.1:  Isolate and identify endophytes from native grasses from saline environments at the Oregon Coast to find novel endophytes that can be utilized to improve persistence and yield of forage (Festuca sp.), turf (Lolium sp.), and bioenergy (switchgrass and Miscanthus sp.) grasses along with cereals (rice and wheat) in environments with substandard water quality.    Sub-objective 1.2:  Identify genes and signaling components involved in abiotic stress responses in the model grasses Lolium temulentum and Brachypodium to evaluate their utility for improving the performance of turf, forage, and bioenergy grasses in diverse end-use environments.    Objective 2:  Reduce the impact of weeds and stem rust, two biotic stresses that negatively impact seed production and the utilization of grasses for livestock production, turf, and bioenergy.   Sub-objective 2.1:  Conduct field trials to evaluate the efficacy of a bioherbicide in reducing the germination of cheatgrass, medusahead, and annual bluegrass weeds in seed production fields and rangeland.  Sub-objective 2.2:  Identify mapping and marker tools that enable the selection of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) germplasm with resistance to stem rust.  Approach: Foundational and applied research will be conducted to reduce the impact of abiotic and biotic stresses on the quality and productivity of grasses that serve as the basis for livestock production, turf, and bioenergy. Objective 1 focuses on the improvement of grass germplasm by developing molecular and biological resources that can be applied to reduce the impact of abiotic stresses on the productivity of grasses. It has been shown that various types of endophytes can enhance a plant's ability to tolerant stress. Research will be conducted to isolate and identify novel bacterial or fungal endophytes from native grasses growing in saline environments along the Oregon Coast. These endophytes will be isolated from plant tissues and seeds, identified, characterized, and reintroduced into a model grass species that is salt sensitive, in order to determine if the novel endophytes are able to improve the plant's ability to grow when subjected to salt stress. There is limited knowledge on the perception or molecular responses to wounding in grasses and how these responses affect persistence, the regrowth of new tissues and the long-term nutritional quality of the grass. Research will be focused on identifying wound inducible genes, locally and systemically, and the signals involved in wounding in forage and turf related grasses. Since most stresses have an oxidative stress component, identification and utilization of oxidative stress response factors may provide useful strategies for increasing tolerance to multiple stresses in grasses. Using bioinformatics approaches, homologs of transcription factors that have been shown to be involved in mediating the oxidative stress responses in eukaryotic systems will be identified. Homologs of the genes will be identified, isolated from grass species and over-expressed in a model grass. These transformed plants will be tested to determine if the over-expression of the homolog gene will improve the tolerance of the plant to different of abiotic stresses. Research conducted in Objective 2 will reduce the impact of weeds and stem rust, two biotic stresses that negatively impact seed production and the utilization of grasses for livestock production, turf, and bioenergy. Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis, is a biotic stress that reduces the yield and quality of grasslands where perennial ryegrass is produced. Whole-plant inoculation and molecular genetic methods will be used to identify and map genetic markers associated with resistance to the stem rust pathogen. The identification and development of mapping and marker tools will enable the selection of perennial ryegrass germplasm with resistance to stem rust. Another form of stress that seriously impacts the quality and utility of grasslands is the presence weeds that can out-compete the agricultural crop for limited resources. Soil application of live pseudomonads which produce a previously identified bioherbicide will tested in two different environments to determine its ability reduce the germination of grassy weeds in field trials.

777,"Objective(s): 1) Conserve, regenerate, back-up, and distribute genetic resources and associated information for wheat, barley, oats, rye, rice, and other small grains and related wild species. More than 140,000 small grains accessions will be conserved. Each year 5-10 percent of National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) accessions will be regenerated. Seeds and associated information will be distributed on request to scientists. 2) Conduct genetic characterizations and phenotypic evaluations of wheat, barley, oats, rye, and other small grains and related wild species for priority genetic and agronomic traits. Apply the preceding knowledge to genetic resource acquisition and curation of selected taxa. Ploidy levels of wheat landraces and wild species of wheat, barley, and oats will be verified. Characterization data will be completed for key descriptors in wheat, barley, and oats. Kernel hardness will be determined for accessions of common bread wheat. 3) Identify and genetically characterize host-plant resistance to the virulent stem rust race Ug99 from NSGC wheat accessions.  Approach: Established procedures will be followed to maintain all NSGC germplasm accessions, with special attention to seed preparation and planting, plant pathogen monitoring, harvest, and laboratory processing. Seed of NSGC accessions are held in medium-term storage under controlled temperature (5-6 C) and relative humidity (25%). Inventory records, including quantity of seed on hand, viability, and date of last regeneration, are maintained in GRIN. Accessions will be scheduled for regeneration based on a priority matrix. Seed will be provided to the NCGRP for safety back up. Standard procedures for GRIN Order Processing will be followed. Distributions outside of the US will follow phytosanitary requirements of the recipient country, including import permits, phytosanitary certificates, and additional declarations. USDA-APHIS will be consulted regularly for the latest information on seed export. The ploidy analyses will be conducted with the Partec CyFlow Ploidy Analyser® following protocols from the manufacturer and modifications developed locally for more efficient analyses of small grains species. Descriptor data will primarily be collected from the voucher images, but direct field and laboratory observations will also be used. Kernel hardness analyses will be performed with the Perten® Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS 4100), which is the wheat industry standard and is supported by USDA-Federal Grain Inspection Service. To identify new sources of resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt, winter habit wheat landraces from the NSGC will be screened. Because field testing capacity at Njoro, Kenya is limited, the accessions will first be tested for adult plant resistance to US races in field trials St. Paul, MN in cooperation with an ARS scientist at the USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL). Accessions with resistance to the US races will then be tested as adult plants in the field for resistance to Ug99 and its variants in the USDA nursery in Kenya.   Accessions showing resistance in one Kenya test will be re-tested to confirm results and tested for seedling resistance to race TTKSK at the CDL. To map resistance to the Ug99 lineage of Pgt in spring wheat landraces and ascertain the relationship to known sources of resistance, mapping populations will be developed from crosses previously made with the susceptible spring line LMPG-6. Mapping populations will be generated either through single seed descent to the F6 generation or through doubled haploid (DH) production. At least 150 DH lines or recombinant inbred lines (RIL) per cross will be generated. The lines will be evaluated for adult plant resistance in the USDA nursery in Kenya and as seedlings against race TTKSK at the CDL.

Sub-objective 2B:  Sequence the exome and catalog mutations of M2 individuals. Sub-objective 2C:  Produce fixed mutant lines for quantitative trait phenotyping (e.g., field sites, multiple locations, replications, and users, destructive phenotyping/selective screening).  Objective 3:  Identify, characterize, and make available mutant phenotypes/mutations that affect rice grain quality and agronomic traits as tools for functional studies and/or varietal improvement.  Sub-objective 3A:  Identify grain quality and agronomic mutants using phenotypic evaluation. Sub-objective 3B:  Identify useful mutant phenotypes by screening populations for mutations in genes involved in biosynthesis and/or accumulation of cooking, eating, and nutritional quality components (i.e. reverse genetics). Sub-objective 3C:  Simultaneous mapping of mutations and germplasm enhancement.  Approach: Goal 1A:  The mutation density of ~4 mutants per Mb using seed mutagenesis will be improved through modification of current protocols. Goal 1B:  Two approaches will be taken: 1) mutagenesis of tetraploid rice; and 2) seed mutagenesis at mutagen doses that elicit high or complete pollen sterility followed by crossing with wild-type pollen. Goal 1C:  The GECN in rice will vary depending on the mutagen, the dose, and the inflorescence (primary vs. secondary tillers).  Goal 2A:  Phenotypic data from a systematic evaluation of M2 and M3 mutants will add value to the mutant resource and provide users with additional criteria for selecting mutant lines for further characterization and/or incorporation into variety development programs. Goal 2B:  Generate in silico mutation profiles of 1,500 to 2,000 independent M2 rice mutants by exome sequencing existing and newly created mutant populations. Goal 2C:  Many valuable mutations/mutant phenotypes may be missed in early generations (i.e. M2 or M3). Fixed lines (=M6 generation) will provide researchers a long-term resource for evaluation of traits under field conditions, that require multiple replications (e.g. locations and years), or that are destructive in nature.  Goal 3A:  Mutations that improve grain quality (milling, cooking, eating, and nutritional) or agronomic performance of rice or that result in novel phenotypes of commercial value may be identified through phenotypic evaluation (i.e. forward genetics). Goal 3B:  Through a combination of TILLING and targeted exome sequencing, mutations in genes of interest will be identified and the corresponding mutants will be characterized. Goal 3C:  Develop a functional genomics/variety development pipeline by applying next-gen sequencing-based methods in combination with accelerated mapping population development to identify mutant phenotypes, map and clone the underlying genes, and generate enhanced germplasm for breeding programs.

781,"Objective(s): Effective defense responses are essential for plants to protect themselves against pathogens. Despite much research, many determinants of host resistance and their roles in signaling remain unknown. Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogenic bacterium, causes disease in more than 150 plant species. ZAR1 is the R protein responsible for recognizing the acetyltransferase HopZ1a, a P. syringae type III secreted effector protein (T3SE). ZAR1 is found in many plant species, including the Solanaceae, castor bean, and rice. However ZAR1 defense signaling does not depend on any components previously implicated in plant resistance, including salicylic acid. Further investigation of ZAR1 signaling gives us a unique opportunity to identify novel genes involved in plant resistance and potential targets for improving plant immunity. This project plan will address three major questions:  1) What other genes are genetically implicated in resistance to HopZ1a? Preliminary data from a forward genetics screen has identified several mutants that lack HopZ1a-mediated defense responses (hopz-effector-triggered-immunity-deficient or zed). The proposed work will map these mutants and characterize their roles in resistance.   2) What is the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance? The proposed work will identify other proteins that contribute to ZAR1-mediated resistance.   3) Is ZAR1 resistance conserved in other plant species? The proposed work will examine ZAR1 resistance in wild and domesticated tomato. Using a multi-pronged approach, this work will identify and characterize new sources of resistance to protect plants from disease.  The specific objectives are: Objective 1:  Conduct genetic screens coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to identify genes that contribute to pathogen resistance in plants.   Objective 2:  Characterize the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance using molecular, genetic, and proteomic approaches.   Objective 3:  Evaluate susceptibility and resist  Approach: Objective 1:   Hypothesis: Using HopZ1a as a probe of immune pathways in plants, we will identify novel genes (ZED1 and ZED2). We hypothesize that ZED1 and ZED2 will not be affected in basal defenses or responses to other T3SEs, and will be specifically involved in HopZ1a recognition. Further, we hypothesize that ZED1 or ZED2 will act as the guardee, and will be acetylated by HopZ1a. Experimental design: Screen F2 population of zed1 (or zed2) cross to Ler for a loss of the HopZ1a-induced macroscopic HR, when pressure-infiltrated with P. syringae carrying hopz1a. Identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms by Illumina sequencing of whole genomes from zed1 or zed2 populations that lack defenses. Characterize the roles of the zed mutants in defense and virulence, and their molecular functions. Contingencies: We can also conduct a genetic suppressor screen for restoration of HopZ1a-mediated immunity in zar1 mutants.  Objective 2:   Hypothesis: Plasma membrane-localized complexes of ZAR1, HopZ1a and other plant proteins will contribute to immunity. Defense-related host proteins will interact specifically with ZAR1. Epitope-tagged ZAR1 will be functional, complement the null zar1 mutant, and interact with other host proteins. Loss of function alleles of unknown (non-zed) plant genes will result in a loss of HopZ1a recognition and increased bacterial growth. Experimental Design: Identify ZAR1-interacting proteins using membrane-based high-throughput yeast two-hybrid approaches and biochemical approaches. Test whether the interacting protein affects defense responses. Contingencies: If the gene of a single interacting protein is part of a gene family, we will silence the gene family by RNAi and test for changes in defense responses.  Objective 3:   Hypothesis: As ZAR1 appears to be an ancient R gene, I hypothesize that HopZ1a will be recognized by a complex of proteins homologous to ZAR1 in tomato. Pto and Prf, known resistance-related genes in tomato, will not be needed for HopZ1a recognition. I further hypothesize that we will observe natural diversity for HopZ1a recognition. Silencing of ZAR1 homologs will result in the loss of HopZ1a resistance. Experimental Design: Infiltrate P. syringae carrying hopz1a into tomato. Test for induction of defense responses by conductivity assays, which measure rapid ion leakage upon recognition of a pathogen, or by bacterial growth assays, which quantitate bacterial growth over time. Silence homologs of ZAR1 to determine if they are necessary for HopZ1a recognition. Contingencies: If our study of natural diversity in tomato progresses more quickly than anticipated or if we fail to identify accessions that are resistant to HopZ1a, we can test additional accessions of tomato. HopZ1a can also be delivered to tomato by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression.

782,"Objective(s): Our overall objective is to understand the molecular genetic control of plant architecture so that it can be manipulated to improve agriculture. We study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the growing tip of the plant. Evidence indicates that cell to cell communication mediated by small secreted signaling molecules is crucial to balance stem cell function with organ formation at the shoot tip, yet very little is known about the expression or function of small signaling molecules in these critical biological processes. We have previously shown that the small signaling gene CLV3 plays a critical role in communicating stem cell fate information in the SAM and developing flower meristems. This project describes a functional genomics approach designed to identify roles in Arabidopsis SAM growth and/or organ formation for four CLV3-related genes, which are members of the CLE (CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED) family of signaling molecules. We will utilize a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to analyze the expression and regulation of the CLE10, CLE16, CLE17 and CLE27 genes in the SAM and initiating organs, and to determine their functions in regulating stem cell activity and/or organ early organ formation. We will also take advantage of the high degree of molecular and functional conservation between different plant species to develop and test hypotheses regarding how knowledge of architectural genes in Arabidopsis can be applied to crop plants to aid in the improvement of agriculturally important traits.  The specific objectives of this project plan are: Objective 1. Analyze the expression and regulation of signaling genes in plant shoots.  Objective 2: Determine the function of signaling genes in plant shoot meristem activity.  Objective 3: Determine the function of signaling genes in plant organ and tissue formation.  Objective 4: Computationally or molecularly test the hypothesis that signaling genes h  Approach: Objective 1. Hypothesis: Additional CLE genes are expressed in specific patterns in the SAM and/or organ primordia during the Arabidopsis life cycle, and these CLE genes will be regulated by known pathways acting in the SAM or organ primordia. Experimental Design: Analyze CLE10, CLE16, CLE17 and CLE27 gene expression in Arabidopsis SAM tissue. Use in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR to analyze CLE16 and CLE17 expression in plants carrying mutations in major SAM regulatory pathway components. Analyze the expression of all four CLE genes in plants that display defects in leaf organ patterning.  Contingencies: If in situ hybridization fails to detect CLE gene expression, then CLE promoter:GUS reporter construct analysis will be conducted. Objective 2. Hypothesis: The CLE16 and CLE17 genes function to control aspects of Arabidopsis SAM activity. Experimental Design: Generate CLE16 and CLE17 loss-of-function lines using insertion mutants and artificial microRNA constructs. Characterize their SAM and lateral organ phenotypes via light and electron microscopy, and histological sectioning. Perform in situ hybridization and GUS staining in the mutants to examine the expression of genes that mark SAM functional domains.  Contingencies: If CLE16/17 loss-of-function phenotypes are not detected in the mutant lines, their over-expression phenotypes will be analyzed using the same methologies. Objective 3. Hypothesis: The CLE10, CLE16, CLE17 and CLE27 genes have overlapping functions in regulating Arabidopsis organ formation. Experimental Design: Generate null mutants and/or amiRNA lines for each of the four CLE genes. Cross these lines to produce triple and quadruple mutant combinations. Analyze their leaf morphogenesis events and growth parameters using computational methods. Analyze their leaf patterning defects using electron microscopy, histological sectioning and quantitative measurements. Perform in situ hybridization, RT-qPCR and GUS staining to examine the expression of genes that mark various leaf domains and regulate different aspects of leaf formation. Contingencies: If phenotypes are not observed in the quadruple mutants, cross them to amiR-CLE5/6 lines to eliminate all CLE gene activity in initiating organs.  Objective 4. Hypothesis: Arabidopsis CLE sequences are conserved in crop species, and crop CLE genes with highly similar expression patterns to those of Arabidopsis CLE genes can be identified via computational methods. Experimental Design: Perform computational sequence analysis to identify CLE sequences in the rice, maize and soybean genomes, and generate a phylogenetic tree. Use in silico gene expression data to compare the expression patterns of Arabidopsis CLE genes with their rice and grass counterparts. Combine the phylogenetic and expression data to determine which rice and grass CLE genes are most similar and thus most likely to share biological functions. Contingencies: Crop genes orthologous to Arabidopsis SAM and organ regulatory genes are likely to be of economic value.  Existing evidence idicates that CLE genes regulating Arabidopsis meristem architecture have similar functions in crop plants as rice and maize.

783,"Objective(s): This project will explore existing genetic rice resources and develop new methods of evaluation to elucidate genetic and environmental factors that influence yield and grain quality. Phenotypic information will be combined with genomic scans to identify chromosomal regions and genes that control these traits. 1: Maintain, regenerate, back-up, characterize, and distribute rice genetic stocks and associated information, and genetically and phenotypically characterize accessions in the NSGC rice collection and elite breeding materials for agronomic and grain quality traits to provide new genetic resources for rice research 1A: Expand and phenotypically and genotypically characterize NSGC collection (Core, Mini-Core, GSOR subsets) for traits essential to rice research community and US rice industry 1B: Develop/characterize a tropical japonica Core collection (TRJ-Core) representing US and international tropical japonica rice germplasm for mining genes for US breeding programs 1C: Evaluate cultivars with divergent processing quality for differences in enzyme activity of starch metabolism genes in response to environmental temperature 1D: Evaluate germplasm with pigmented bran using in vitro cell assays for 1) influence of cooking on bioactivity of phenolics having potential health-beneficial properties against cancer, and 2) bioactivity of bran extracts against diabetes 1E: Assess accessions in rice diversity panels for health-beneficial starch fractions 1F: Assess accessions for bran components that impact storage stability of brown rice 2: Use genome wide association studies and QTL mapping techniques to identify alleles that control yield components and grain quality traits in response to environmental variables 2A: Determine location of QTL and allelic variability associated with yield components in bi-parental mapping populations 2B: Identify QTLs and alleles responsible for transgressive variation in selected yield components found in rice wild species  Approach: This project will explore genetic resources using phenotypic and genomic tools to identify novel traits that impact rice yield and grain quality. Chromosomal regions that control these traits will be determined though association mapping techniques using germplasm surveys and QTL mapping of bi-parental and backcross mapping populations. Genetic resources ranging from elite US breeding materials and commercial cultivars, to diverse global germplasm, and wild Oryza species accessions will serve as the basis for extensive phenotyping and genotyping studies. In addition, a new diversity panel based upon tropical japonica germplasm, which is the source of US cultivars, will be developed to mine for novel alleles for traits relevant to the US rice industry. Targeted traits will include yield, disease resistance, and agronomic traits, as well as milling, nutritional, and processing quality. Mapping populations will be developed for diverse tropical japonica parents and from crosses with wild species to identify alleles that are associated with yield components. Compounds in rice bran that have been identified in raw rice that reduce cancer cell growth and glucose uptake in in vitro studies will be isolated and evaluated for their health beneficial properties and their bio-activity following cooking. Global rice genetic resources that have high amylose content will be evaluated for resistant starch to identify germplasm that may be beneficial for reducing spikes in blood sugar associated with diabetes. Enzymes that control starch structure and rice parboiling quality will be evaluated in diverse rice germplasm grown under high temperature. Enzymes that are sensitive to temperature stress and negatively impact processing quality will be identified. These will be targets for genetic improvement to develop improved stability in processing quality. In an effort to increase market use for whole grain brown rice, which is more nutritious than milled rice, components in the rice bran that can reduce rancidity during storage will be identified. Mapping populations that are segregating for grain chalk, milling yield, and grain fissure resistance, factors that impact crop value, will be used to finely map QTL and identify candidate genes associated with these traits. In addition, segregating populations will be analyzed for grain mineral content in an effort to develop nutrient-dense germplasm. Grain arsenic accumulation can occur when rice is grown under flooded, anaerobic conditions. The interaction of diverse germplasm and water management techniques will be studied to identify how these two factors can minimize grain arsenic accumulation while sustaining economically viable yields. The long-term objective of this project is to seek a better understanding of the genetic control of yield and grain quality traits, and this information can be translated into superior rice cultivars that will strengthen domestic and export markets for USA rice.

784,"Objective(s): The long-term objective of this project is to seek a better understanding of the genetic and molecular bases of rice response to biotic and abiotic stresses in an effort to maintain high yields, improve crop resilience to changes in climate and cultural management practices, and to reduce reliance on pesticides for crop protection. Obj. 1: Evaluate novel sources of disease resistance to develop closely linked genetic markers for breeding, and elucidate plant-pathogen interactions. 1A: Develop new genetic markers associated with genes that control resistance response to rice blast disease 1B: Explore new genetic resources that possess novel alleles for major and minor genes that convey resistance to the sheath blight pathogen Obj. 2: Identify and genetically map traits associated with weed suppression in indica rice germplasm. 2A: Develop methods to quantify alleleopathy chemicals and other weed suppressive traits using greenhouse, laboratory, and field assays 2B: Characterize relative contribution of agronomic traits and allelopathy to weed suppression effective under reduced-irrigation systems or reduced-pesticide/organic systems 2C: Validate and fine-map QTLs associated with early tiller production for development of genetic markers suitable for breeding for weed suppression in US genetic backgrounds 2D: Identify QTLs associated with weed suppression using RIL mapping population derived from an allelopathic weed suppressive/non-suppressive tropical japonica cross Obj. 3: Explore rice genetic resources for use in adapting to climate change and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.  3A: Identify genetic resources that can be used in breeding to adapt to extremes in temperature at the seedling and flowering stage 3B: Identify genetic resources that can be used to mitigate methane emissions in rice production Obj. 4: Investigate the use of genetic resources for production under irrigation systems that use less water.  4A: Discover chromosomal regions linked  Approach: Wild rice accessions will be evaluated for blast disease resistance and sources with novel genes will be used in a backcrossing program to both map the novel QTL and develop germplasm with improved resistance. A major gene that provides resistance to a blast race that is virulent on all sources of resistance commonly used in the USA will be finely mapped. Closely linked DNA markers will be used for its introgression using marker assisted selection into improved germplasm for use by breeders. The interaction and evolutionary dynamics of genes involved in blast resistance in both rice and the pathogen will be examined. The genetic identity of contemporary and historical field isolates will be determined using genomic techniques and international differentials. Small differences in resistance response to sheath blight disease will be evaluated and used to identify the location of quantitative resistance QTL. Newly introduced wild accessions of rice and diverse global cultivars will be evaluated for novel sheath blight resistance alleles which will be incorporated to US germplasm for use by breeders. A major sheath blight resistant QTL will be finely mapped so that DNA markers and improved germplasm can be developed. Rice root imaging, plant growth patterns, early tillering, and allelopathic activity associated with weed suppression will be determined and used in mapping studies. Weed suppression traits effective under reduced-irrigation systems or reduced-pesticide/organic systems will be characterized. Cold temperature tolerance at the seedling stage and high temperature stress at the flowering stage will be assessed using diversity panels and mapping populations. A greenhouse study will be conducted using rice cultivars demonstrated to differ in methane emissions under field conditions to determine plant traits that may explain these differences. Best nitrogen fertilizer management practices for minimizing greenhouse gas emissions will be identified using intermittent flood and genetic resources previously shown to differ in methane emissions. The key components including best cultural management techniques and agronomic and phenological traits associated with greenhouse gas reduction relevant to southern US germplasm will be identified. Genetic markers that are linked to key phenotypic traits associated with productivity under intermittent flood will be identified for ultimately developing cultivars that can be grown under reduced water use. Genetic resources and markers that demonstrate genetic differences for salinity tolerance at the seedling stage will be identified to develop improved germplasm and cultivars for US rice production. The outcome of this research will result in genetic markers linked to traits that can be incorporated into new cultivars that are resilient to disease, weed pressure, salinity, extremes in temperatue, and can be grown under production practices that use less water and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

785,"Objective(s): The overall goal of the project is to identify DNA elements that support effective strategies for stacking multiple traits within a single locus, removal of unwanted DNA sequences, and predictable expression of each transgene within that locus. These molecular tools will enable improved and precise engineering of complex, multi-gene traits in crop plants. Site-specific recombination systems and gene expression control elements with proven utility will be made available to researchers in the public and private sectors.  Objective 1:  Develop and deploy in crop plants site-specific recombinase-based systems for (1) targeted transgene integration and gene stacking, and (2) marker gene removal to prevent gene flow to non-genetically engineered crops.   Subobjective 1a: Enhance site specific recombination systems for precise integration and excision in crop plant cells. Subobjective 1b: Use Dual RMCE to produce Foundation Lines that will allow transgene stacking via reiterative targeted integration and marker gene removal.  Objective 2:  Identify and demonstrate the utility of crop-derived gene expression control elements (promoters/enhancers/terminators/insulators) that facilitate trait development in crop plants. Subobjective 2a:  Isolate and characterize novel promoters. Subobjective 2b:  Isolate and characterize novel transcription terminators.  Approach: Random mutagenesis will be used to generate site-specific recombinase variants that will be screened for improved integrase and excisionase activities in a recombinase activity assay. Versions with improved catalytic activities in bacterial cells will be tested in plant cells. Mutated recombinases with improved activity will be codon optimized and tested in transgenic plants. In parallel, “target” transgenic plants will be generated by Agrobacterium–mediated transformation of Camelina. “Exchange” T-DNA vectors will be constructed to test four pairs of uni-directional recombinases, and designed so that an incoming gene is integrated at the target site and the selection marker gene is excised in a two-step sequential process. The “exchange” vectors will be transformed into the “target” Camelina transgenic plants. Negative selection will be used to screen for transformants in which the incoming DNA has replaced the original transgenic locus (Recombinase-Mediated Cassette Exchange or RMCE). The resultant transgene structure will be molecularly characterized to demonstrate that cassette exchange and selection marker gene removal have occurred. The efficiencies of different combinations of the unidirectional recombinases in performing RMCE will be compared.    Candidate promoters with new cell-type/organ or stress-responsive specificities will be identified from crop plants using gene expression analyses. Emphasis will be on selecting candidates that have potentially useful expression patterns, but are not expressed in the grain. The candidate promoters will be fused to a reporter gene and transformed into rice, wheat, Brachypodium distachyon and/or other plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens or biolistic transformation methods. Novel transcription terminator sequences will also be isolated from crop plants and fused to a reporter gene. The functionality of these promoter and terminator testing constructs will be examined in transient expression assays and stably transformed transgenic plants. Reporter gene expression levels will be quantitatively measured in major organs and compared to identify the sequences that provide the highest levels of transgene products while preserving promoter expression specificity. Additionally, a screen to identify “insulator” sequences that protect the expression of transgenes from undesirable interactions with nearby enhancers will be performed using a construct containing two copies of the highly active 35S enhancer. A library of crop genomic sequences will be tested for insulation activity using a transient expression assay. Selected candidate insulator sequences will also be tested in stably transformed transgenic plants. The functionality of the candidate insulator sequences will be validated if their insertion between the double 35S enhancer and a test promoter preserves the native specificity of the test promoter.

Develop genus-, species-, or clone-specific DNA markers.    Sub-objective 3.B. Develop trait-specific DNA markers through genetic mapping and association studies.  Approach: The program’s breeding strategy is to increase the genetic diversity of parental clones through: (1) acquisition and maintenance of germplasm from wild species of Saccharum and related genera; (2) characterization of parents and progeny for traits (cold tolerance, stubbling ability, disease resistance, and sugarcane borer resistance) that will increase the adaptation of sugarcane to Louisiana’s temperate climate; (3) utilization of crossing and molecular marker techniques to produce interspecific and intergeneric hybrids containing new sources of disease and insect resistance and cold tolerance; and (4) recombination of progeny through backcrossing to develop parental material containing a concentration of desirable genes for the commercial breeding program.  Screening procedures will be developed to determine relative cold tolerance among clonal material in the basic breeding program.  Cultivar development will emphasize increased sugar yield, along with other import traits such as yield components (stalk number, height, and diameter), fiber concentration, rate of maturation, ratooning ability (stand longevity), harvestability (resistance to lodging, stalk erectness, and stalk brittleness), hardiness (winter survival, early spring vigor, and stalk and ratoon freeze tolerance), abiotic stress tolerance (droughts, floods, and heavy clay soils), and resistance to stalk boring insects (sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer) and diseases (smut, rust, leaf scald, mosaic, yellow leaf virus, and ratoon stunting).  Recurrent selection techniques will be utilized to accelerate the rate of genetic improvement for these important traits.  In addition, trait-specific markers closely associated with traits such as sucrose accumulation, cold tolerance, and resistance to the sugarcane borer will be developed to assist breeders in eliminating undesirable plants early in the selection process.

787,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Introduction: Despite an information explosion about antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in bacteria, patients are dying of untreatable infections for the first time since antibiotics were discovered. The main cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in gram-negative bacteria is active efflux of drug by bacterial pumps. Knowing how the pumps are regulated is the key to understanding MDR development: bacteria can become MDR simply by increasing expression of these efflux pumps. Significance: Bacteroides fragilis are ubiquitous gut commensals that cause devastating disease when they escape the gut; their resistance to antimicrobials is rising significantly. In aerobes, MDR is caused by efflux pumps regulated by transcription factors (TFs). We hypothesize that MDR efflux pumps in B. fragilis are similarly regulated by TFs. These TFs, and the pumps they regulate, may also regulate other virulence factors. VA patients are particularly at risk for anaerobic infections. Mortality in Bacteroides bacteremia is high (25- 50%) and liver disease, common in VA patients, is a risk factor for increased mortality. We identified several MDR clinical isolates (including one from a GI in Afghanistan) with increased pump activity; these isolates were resistant to metronidazole and other agents and resulted in one death and one amputation, respectively. Preliminary Studies: In the previous funding period, we identified and characterized the B. fragilis bme efflux pump genes and showed that they were implicated in clinical MDR (described in 23 publications); we found that increases in pump levels and in resistance could be induced by a variety of agents and stressors including antimicrobials, salicylate, bile and quorum sensing molecules. We constructed new vectors and modified them to mimic the molecular tools available for use with aerobes. Research Plan: Our long term goal is to unravel the complex regulation of MDR in B. fragilis. Specifically, our goals now are to: AIM 1: Identify the TFs most important in efflux-mediated MDR (both activator and repressor TFs) using a functional genomic approach. AIM 2: Characterize TFs most important in efflux-mediated MDR. Determine the phenotype associated with the TF, measure MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) and determine the relevant bme genes. Demonstrate binding by physical and functional approaches. AIM 3: Determine the clinical prevalence of TF regulation in efflux mediated MDR. Measure TF transcription levels in clinical isolates, including the recently acquired MDR strains. Determine the effect of TF on efflux-mediated MDR and on ability to form biofilms. Assess the effect of bile exposure on TF transcription levels, MICs and biofilm forming ability. This study takes advantage of our unique resources: expertise with molecular and biochemical approaches, access to a massive collection of clinical isolates and associated MIC data, and excellent collaborative relationships with world-class experts. Once completed, this work, together with the studies already conducted, will reveal important new information about regulation of BF MDR pumps and will greatly contribute to our knowledge of regulation mechanisms in this bacterium that is subject to very different stresses than aerobic pathogens. B. fragilis is an important component of the gut microbiome (which has been called a separate  organ  within the human body) that is recognized as having its own impressive metabolic profile and profoundly affects almost every aspect of human health and disease. In this global environment, there is little time from the emergence of the first MDR strains to widespread resistance. Racing to develop effective drugs when untreatable infections emerge is not a viable public health strategy. Regulators of MDR efflux are important targets in drug discovery; identifying and understanding the TFs that are most important in these MDR organisms will lead to the development of new and effective interventional therapies that target the expression or translation of these factors.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Rising antimicrobial resistance costs 5-30 billion dollars and 90,000 lives in the US alone! Multi-drug efflux pumps are largely responsible for this resistance. Bacteroides fragilis is an important member of the gut microbiota that has critical roles in human health and disease. We have virtually no information about these pumps or their regulation in this important anaerobic pathogen. abdominal wall; Accounting; Address; adverse outcome; Aerobic; Aerobic Bacteria; Affect; Afghanistan; Amputation; Anaerobic Bacteria; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotics; Anti-Infective Agents; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Antimicrobial Resistance; Area; Attention; Bacteremia; Bacteria; Bacterial Genome; Bacterial Infections; bacterial resistance; Bacteroides; Bacteroides fragilis; Bile fluid; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; biological research; Biology; Businesses; capsule; Cessation of life; Chronic; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Code; Collection; Colon; combat; Communities; Complex; Consensus; cost; Data; design; Development; Disease; drug development; drug discovery; Drug Efflux; Drug resistance; efflux pump; Elements; Environment; Escherichia coli; Explosion; Face; Family; Foundations; Frequencies; functional genomics; Funding; Funding Agency; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic Transcription; genome sequencing; global environment; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; gut microbiota; Health; Healthcare; Homologous Gene; Human; Human body; Individual; Industry; Infection; information gathering; inhibitor/antagonist; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Liver diseases; Measures; Mediating; Medical center; member; Membrane; Metabolic; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Metronidazole resistance; Microbial Biofilms; microbiome; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multi-Drug Resistance; mutant; Nosocomial Infections; One-Step dentin bonding system; Operon; Organ; Organism; Outcome; Outcome Study; Outcomes Research; overexpression; Oxygen; pathogen; pathogenic bacteria; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Phenotype; Predisposition; Prevalence; Probability; Public Health; public health relevance; Publications; Published Comment; Pump; quorum sensing; Race; Regimen; Regulation; Regulon; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Resistance; Resistance development; resistance mechanism; resistant strain; Resources; response; Rice; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; salicylate; Scientist; sensor; Solid; Stress; stressor; Surface; System; Therapeutic; Time; tool; transcription factor; Transcription factor genes; translation factor; Up-Regulation; vector; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Virulent; WorkREGULATION OF BACTEROIDES FRAGILIS MULTIDRUG EFFLUX PUMPS",0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06

Most environmental mercury contamination originates from fossil fuel combustion and mining activity and is deposited into ecosystems in a relatively harmless inorganic form. Microbial methylation within anoxic sediments, however, converts inorganic pollutants into methylmercury, dramatically increasing mercury&rsquo;s bioavailability. Yet, the role of biotic and abiotic factors in mercury cycling is not well understood.

Although these previous alliances and demonstration projects differed with respect to implementation strategies, they all had a strong emphasis on mentoring. As such, the newly combined Institute for African-American Mentoring in Computing Sciences (iAAMCS, pronounced  i am cs ) will serve as a national resource and emphasize mentoring as the primary strategy for increasing the participation of African-Americans in computing, specifically at the Ph.D. level and beyond. The overarching goal of the iAAMCS is to increase the number of African-Americans obtaining computing sciences doctoral degrees leading to an increase in the number of African-American researchers in the academy, government, and industry. Toward this goal, the iAAMCS Alliance will (1) increase the number of African-American Ph.D. graduates who enter the workforce with a research focus; (2) retain and advance African-American Ph.D. students, faculty and researchers in computing; and (3) develop future African-American leaders with computing expertise in the academy, government, and industry.

This project will provide a unique collaborative experience involving leading researchers, graduate students, and postdocs with multiple research fields and techniques that will make important contributions to the development of the future leaders of modern physics research. base; Charge; chemical substitution; Collaborations; Communities; Computer Simulation; Computing Methodologies; design; Development; Devices; Disease; electric field; Electrolytes; electronic structure; Electronics; Engineering; experience; Faculty; frontier; Future; Goals; graduate student; Interdisciplinary Study; Iron; Lead; lectures; Life; Light; Magnetism; member; Methods; Muons; nanoscale; Neutrons; novel; Online Systems; phase change; Physical condensation; Physics; Play; Postdoctoral Fellow; Principal Investigator; Relaxation; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; Rice; Role; Route; Scanning Tunneling Microscopy; Scientist; Semiconductors; Series; solid state; Specimen; Structure; System; Techniques; Technology; theories; Transition Temperature; voltage; WorkDMREF/COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: DESIGNING, UNDERSTANDING AND FUNCTIONALIZING NOVEL SUPERCONDUCTORS AND MAGNETIC DERIVATIVES",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06
797,"Rice University, the University of Michigan, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are awarded collaborative grants to develop and implement algorithms and software tools for the analysis of gene genealogies and inference of species phylogenies from them. A gene genealogy, also known as gene tree, models how genes replicate and get transmitted from one generation to the next during evolution. A species phylogeny models how species arise and diverge. A species phylogeny is traditionally inferred by a three-step process: (1) a genomic region from the set of species under study is sequenced; (2) a  gene tree  is inferred for the genomic region; and, (3) the gene tree is declared to be the species tree. However, recent evolutionary genomic analyses of various groups of organisms have demonstrated that different genomic regions may have evolutionary histories that disagree with each other as well as with that of the species. Further, evolutionary processes such as horizontal gene transfer, result in network-like, rather than tree-like, species phylogenies. This joint project will develop accurate computational methods for determining the causes of gene tree discordance, and inferring species phylogenies (trees as well as networks) from gene trees despite their discordance. Special emphasis will be put on the efficiency of the methods so that they allow for analysis of genome-scale data sets. All methods will be implemented and extensively tested for performance. All methods developed will be made publicly available in software packages that we have been developing in the respective groups. The material will be integrated into courses that the PIs regularly teach at their respective institutions. Last but not least, the project will culminate with a two-day workshop, open to students and post-doctoral fellows from around the country, with presentations by the investigators on the methodologies developed, as well as hands-on tutorials on using the tools in analyzing data.

798,"This project supports a cooperative research effort by Foster Agbelvor of Utah State University and Waleed El-Zawawy of the National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt. The goal of their project is to develop new catalysts that can be used to convert waste agricultural biomass feedstocks directly into phenols and anhydrosugars which can then be used, without any secondary separation steps, to produce biodegradable plastics and other value added products. This research seeks to improve the process of catalytic pyrolysis, which uses heat and a catalyst to break down tough, lignocellulosic biomass, in this case agricultural waste from rice, cotton and banana farming, into small molecules that can be used for other purposes. In this research effort, the products of catalytic pyrolysis, anhydrosugars and phenolics, will be used to make biodegradable plastics. Overall, this process allows plastics to be made from a renewable resource that is otherwise a waste material, while also making a product plastic that causes less pollution.  The Egyptian team will be primarily responsible for developing new catalysts while the U.S. team will work to improve the pyrolysis process including the use and recycling of gases, with both teams seeking to improve yields of the desired aromatic products. The research effort will also use the oils produced from fractional catalytic pyrolysis to produce biobased polyurethane foam and  novolac  polymers.Overall this research may lead to new knowledge of how to produce chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. It will also demonstrate how to generate new and high-value plastic products from agricultural wastes that are widely available in Egypt and the USA, while simultaneously addressing the problem of disposal of those agricultural wastes. In Egypt the byproducts of rice and cotton production are often burned in the fields, increasing air pollution that is responsible for significant deterioration of archeological monuments. The conversion of the agricultural residues to biobased materials has the potential to start new industries and create employment opportunities in rural Egypt and the USA. The project will also involve the participation of female scientists such as Dr. Maha Ibrahim, the training of Egyptian junior researchers and a U.S. graduate student. This project is funded through the US-Egypt Joint Science and Technology Fund Program. Support for the U.S. side of these cooperative projects is provided to the National Science Foundation by the U.S. Department of State.

799,"Rice is a staple crop for nearly half of the people on Earth, yet its quality and quantity are affected by arsenic (As) with consequent impacts on global human health and food security. Silicon (Si) addition to rice paddy soil has been proposed as a potential mitigation strategy since the dominant form of As in rice paddies shares a root-uptake pathway with Si in rice; however, addition of Si may inadvertently impact other biogeochemical cycles such as iron (Fe) and carbon (C) in soil, depending on the source of Si used.  Thus, before Si addition can be proposed as a feasible strategy to mitigate arsenic uptake by rice globally, fundamental scientific questions must be addressed.  Accordingly, the goal of this project is to understand how different sources of Si added to soil will affect a) As uptake and accumulation in rice, b) Fe plaque formation and mineralogy (which influences As mobility), and c) carbon dioxide and methane production and efflux. The outcomes of this work will increase the basic scientific understanding of altered Si on As, Fe, and C cycling in rice paddies, and may identify an affordable and practical solution to the arsenic-in-rice problem with consequent benefits for the global society. Furthermore, the outcomes of this work have a strong educational component and will be widely disseminated to rice-growers through partnerships with non-profit organizations, and to the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. This research will have both laboratory and field components and the investigations will span the nanometer to meter-field scale.  A major component is the establishment of a new outdoor research-education laboratory, the Rice Investigation, Communication, and Education (RICE) Facility. The RICE Facility will be constructed -with ongoing aid of students in the Landscape Design program- at the University of Delaware (UD), and will enable field experiments in rice paddy mesocosms during summers and allow the integration of research with educational outreach objectives. The overarching educational goal is to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in (geo)science by providing scholastic opportunities for female and economically-disadvantaged students.  Specifically, a) an annual 1-day summer-camp entitled Soil is Life will be developed at the RICE Facility for students from the all-female middle-school Serviam Academy, b) a high-school student from Newark High School will be paid to work on this project at the RICE Facility annually during summer months, c) a new undergraduate course will be developed that integrates soils and sustainability, and d) this project will directly train graduate students on this interfacial field of study.  The proposed research and education will propel the career as a young scientist, support her continual development into a successful teacher-scholar at University of Delaware, and support her ongoing commitment and efforts to increase the integration and representation of underrepresented groups in (geo)science.

800,"This project establishes an I-Corps Node that is focused on promoting innovation in the Southwest region of the United States (the Southwest Alliance for Entrepreneurial Innovation Node -  SAEIN ). SAEIN efforts will leverage the combined entrepreneurial experience and extensive research capabilities of three lead research institutions: The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), Texas A&M University (TAMU), and Rice University (Rice). Geographically, SAEIN will serve an area of more than 268,000 square miles and help foster the implementation of I-Corps methodologies across a collaborative group of more than 30 institutions of higher learning. SAEIN will specifically engage numerous Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to implement the I-Corps curriculum and methods as both a standard for entrepreneurial training and a mechanism to broaden participation in STEM fields. SAEIN has the potential to introduce NSF I-Corps curriculum to more than 710,000 community college students and almost 4.8 million K-12 students in the state.SAEIN will engage the use of I-Corps methodology throughout entrepreneurship-focused entities and events, including regional academic incubators, the Small Business Development Centers, high profile business plan competitions, and the international South by Southwest (SXSW) event. SAEIN will augment the NIN capabilities by building on the unique economic strengths, labor characteristics, lean manufacturing capabilities, and the innovation ecosystem found in the Southwest region. The Node will generate tremendous exposure for the I-Corps program nationwide and provide a unique platform for innovation promotion and venture development.SAEIN engages a strong alliance of institutions that are already connected by a large volume of NSF-supported research projects. It seeks to advance economic growth goals for the region and nation through a variety of programs and activities that employ the business model canvas and team-based discovery practice to best understand the intellectual property resulting from these projects. SAEIN will study the deployment of I-Corps methodologies into regional community college systems and investigate ways to increase STEM participation and 4-year transfer rates from community colleges through the application of I-Corps. Specific Level 3 research thrusts will explore: 1) Lean LaunchPad research that is targeted at vetting the impact of pivots and customer discovery on entrepreneurial success and scientific outcomes; 2) development of a STEM research canvas model that is focused on producing suitable STEM learning sets focused on K-12 STEM learners (consistent with the Business Model Canvas and I-Corps methodologies); and 3) I-Corps Team Modeling and Development, with a focus on exploring the effectiveness of new teaming models around I-Corps methodologies from different populations (i.e., community colleges, K-12, additional external groups).

803,"Fertilization and seed production in flowering plants relies on the delivery of two sperm to female gametes by a pollen tube. The success of the long and rapid journey of the pollen tube relies on constant signaling between the pollen tube cell and the cells of the pistil. Pollen tubes must find specific cellular targets, they must burst when they arrive at the target, and their sperm must fuse with female gametes. These events are all essential for seed production, which is central to agricultural production and food security. Our goal is to understand the molecules that mediate exchanges between pollen and pistil. Cellular interactions between pollen and pistil are mediated by extracellular signaling exchanges occurring in a complex environment where multiple pollen tubes are competing for a limited number of ovules. Ovules are the structures where female gametes develop and that mature into seeds (e.g. rice grains and corn kernels) only after successful fertilization by a pollen tube. The United States will be better able to contribute to scientific progress when our scientists represent the full diversity of our nation.  This project will provide cutting edge training in biological imaging, genetics and genomics for early-stage students from groups that have not traditionally been represented in US science. These students will join a team of graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher who will also receive training through this project.This project will use unique molecular tools to define: 1) Pollen components of the signaling system that results in cessation of tube growth and sperm release in the ovule, 2) Novel components of the mechanisms required for gamete fusion, and 3) How gamete fusion triggers a mechanism that prevents multiple pollen tubes from entering a single ovule.This project will take an integrated approach to the study of fertilization in flowering plants. The molecules that must be displayed by the pollen tube for recognition by the female will be discovered. The project will also define novel components of the gamete fusion mechanism and test hypotheses aimed at understanding how gamete fusion blocks attraction of subsequent pollen tubes. The project takes advantage of unique expertise in imaging, genetics, and genomics to understand how pollen-pistil interactions are integrated to maximize seed production. Defining the molecular exchanges between pollen and pistil that maximize reproductive success will transform our ability to generate new crop varieties with resilient pollination systems.

804,"Statistical machine learning (ML) is a commonly-applied framework for analyzing very large data sets. In statistical ML, the goal is to learn a statistical model that can be used to understand the data, find patterns, or make predictions.  Thus, many new software systems have been designed to support easy implementation and fast execution of parallel/distributed ML computer codes over large data sets.  Almost all of those systems are  non-relational  in the sense that they utilize data and programming models that are very different from today's relational database management systems.  Still, the attractiveness of the relational or database-oriented approach to data processing persists. For example, codes running on top of a database are declarative, so a programmer need only be concerned with what he or she wants, and not how to obtain it. This makes it easier to write codes and get them to run in a distributed environment, enabling a strong separation between the code and the database data processing algorithms, storage, hardware, and indexing, and even from the database schema.  Further, much of the world's structured data sits in relational databases, and extracting anything more than a small subsample of a large data set for external use is typically a non-starter. Being able to execute a ML inference code within the database, using the database engine, would greatly increase applicability of statistical ML.  This project will perform the fundamental research necessary to make ML-in-the-database a mature technology. All of the ideas developed by the project will be prototyped, evaluated, and distributed within the context of SimSQL, which is a parallel, relational database system, augmented with the ability to perform  stochastic analytics . This means that SimSQL has special facilities that allow a user to define special database tables that have simulated data---these are data that are not actually stored in the database, but are produced by calls to statistical distributions.  Since tables of simulated data in SimSQL can have such recursive dependencies, it is easy to use SimSQL to run stochastic ML inference algorithms (such as MCMC) over  Big Data . Research tasks include increasing the level of performance of SimSQL by exploiting the optimization opportunities presented by large-scale, iterative, ML computations. They also include expanding the types of ML inference algorithms that can easily be specified in SimSQL's SQL dialect, making SimSQL applicable for various stochastic inference algorithms such as MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and Monte Carlo EM (Expectation Maximization). Further, the project will investigate automatically compiling R and BUGS-like ML algorithm specifications into SimSQL SQL.

807,"In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor R. Bruce Weisman of Rice University is developing new ways to characterize and purify a scientifically and technologically important class of nanomaterials: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). These nanotubes display many remarkable properties that make them of great current interest to researchers pursuing basic science as well as real-world applications. However, progress in this field is often limited by difficulties in finding the amounts of specific nanotube structures that are present in samples, assessing the nanotube quality, detecting them in trace quantities in biological and environmental specimens, and sorting nanotube mixtures into pure structural forms. This project addresses these challenges using novel experimental methods. This research will provide broader impacts through the participation and professional development of underrepresented minority and women science students. In addition, the experimental methods and findings of the project should speed the development of new and economically valuable commercial technologies based on carbon nanotubes.The project will explore and develop variance spectroscopy, a new optical technique that serves as a bridge between bulk and single-particle regimes and can reveal nanoparticle concentrations, emission efficiencies, inhomogeneities, and aggregation. A recently developed method will be used to directly measure the absolute, structure-specific absorption cross-sections needed to quantify the compositions of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) samples. Improved analysis methods will support efforts to more effectively sort SWCNTs by length. The project will also focus on enhancing the sensitivity limits for detecting and imaging SWCNTs present in complex samples at trace concentrations. absorption; Address; base; Basic Science; Biological; Carbon Nanotubes; Chemicals; Chemistry; Complex; Development; Funding; Image; improved; interest; Length; Measurement; Measures; Methods; nanomaterials; nanoparticle; Nanotubes; novel; Optics; particle; professor; programs; Property; real world application; Research; Research Personnel; Rice; Sampling; Science; single walled carbon nanotube; Sorting - Cell Movement; Specimen; Spectrum Analysis; Structure; Students; Techniques; Technology; Underrepresented Minority; Universities; WomanADVANCED OPTICAL CHARACTERIZATION AND IMAGING OF SINGLE-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES",0.999999,1e-06,3.6390655342374616e-06,1e-06,1.6869090797040412e-06,1e-06,2.092731933279756e-05

Such solutions can help societies address fundamental issues such as poverty and environmental sustainability, problems that that contribute to both economic and political instability.  Roughly 30 / 40 scholars will participate in the meeting, of whom approximately 25 will present individual research papers for comment by the group.  Participants will be a mix of senior and junior scholars with an effort to incorporate especially junior scholars who have not interacted with the group previously.  Most of the participants' research involves at least two of three methodologies common in this area, namely laboratory decision-making experiments, theoretical modeling, and field studies. Funding will mainly cover travel expenses and accommodations of participants, who come from multiple U.S. regions and in a few cases from abroad.The social dilemmas working group was first convened at Indiana University in 2003 by a group of scholars led by the late Nobel Prize winner Elinor Ostrom, who also helped to organize the subsequent four meetings, held at Max Planck Institute, Jena, Germany in 2006, Florida State University in 2008, Rice University in 2010, and California Institute of Technology in 2013.  Regular participants have included leading contributors to economic theory and experimental economics, such as Charles Plott, John Ledyard, James Cox and James Walker, and there have been numerous other participants who are well-known contributors to the field including James Andreoni, Gary Charness, Catherine Eckel, Simon G?chter, Werner Guth, and Joe Oppenheimer.  Co-organizers of the 2015 conference in addition to Walker are Louis Putterman, Pedro Dal B?, and Rick Wilson, who have also been part of the previous meetings.  Our full proposal lists numerous research publications by group members in professional journals including the American Economic Review, American Journal of Political Science, Review of Economic Studies, Quarterly Journal of Economics, and Science. It is anticipated that the interaction among participants will help lead to progress in understanding social dilemma problems that will not only lead to future scientific publications, affecting teaching in our disciplines going forward, but also contribute to the design of better policy approaches for problems of resource management and of strengthening public institutions.

810,"Given a set of molecular (DNA, RNA, or amino acid) sequences obtained from a number of organisms, phylogenetic inference is the task of reconstructing the evolutionary relationships among the sequences. These relationships are represented as an evolutionary tree, or, more generally, a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) when horizontal or vertical transmission of genetic material is modeled. The proposed project investigates the popular Bayesian approach to phylogenetic inference. Currently, all popular software packages for Bayesian inference utilize Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The problem is that these algorithms can take months to converge on large inference problems.The project's aim is to develop parallel algorithms for MCMC that are suitable for use in a modern cluster compute environment, such as Amazon.com's EC2 service.  To ensure broader impacts of this work, the software, along with a user's manual and tutorial, will be open-sourced and the PIs will make special effort in recruiting students from underrepresented groupsFor a phylogenetic inference algorithm to scale to thousands of organisms, parallelization is mandatory. For example, one idea that the project will expore is the so-called Bayesian Forest (BF) approach.  In the BF approach, the MCMC algorithm maintains not one tree or DAG, but dozens, hundreds, or thousands of trees or DAGs at the same time, where all of them work together and share information with one another as the algorithm runs.  This tends to avoid problems associated with converging to poor, locally optimal solutions because as long as one tree/DAG has avoided a problem configuration, over time, that tree/DAG can pull the entire forest away from the poor solution.  Crucially, since the most expensive computations over the individual trees/DAGs are independent of one another, it is easy to send them to different machines.  The project will also consider distributed algorithms for challenging variants of the problem, such as  multi-loci data sets and vertical and horizontal transmission of genetic material, as well as co-estimation of gene and species trees. All software, along with a user's manual and tutorial, will be open-sourced.  The project web page will be available at http://cmj4.web.rice.edu/phylogenetics.

811,"Mobile data usage is skyrocketing thanks to the popularity of smartphones and tablets. Wireless network carriers are scrambling to increase their capacity by acquiring spectrum and deploying more base stations. Multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) technologies have been widely recognized for their potential to significantly improve the spectral efficiency of wireless communication. In theory, the capacity of MIMO grows with the number of antennas. Because mobile devices are form factor-constrained, the majority of research has focused on placing many antennas on base stations, with aggressive proposals calling for hundreds of them. Such effort has created three pressing needs in wireless research platforms. First, there is a need for base stations with many antennas so that there is flexibility in how antennas are used, both for communication and experimental measurement. Second, there is a need for a network research platform in which emerging ideas that deal with inter-cell interference can be experimentally studied.  Finally, there is a need for a network research platform with adequate and distributed computing resources to address the computational requirement and systems challenges of implementing advanced MIMO technologies. This project will develop ArgosNet, a reconfigurable multi-cell research platform that will meet the above three needs. ArgosNet will not only allow cutting-edge ideas for using MIMO to be experimentally tested under realistic settings, but also enable the teaching of them with a real-world experimental deployment. ArgosNet has three completely programmable key components: (i) a configurable number of base stations each of which can have up to several hundreds of antennas, (ii) battery-powered mobile terminals, (iii) a server cluster that are connected with the base stations with high-throughout, precisely synchronized backhaul. Real-time, wideband communication between base station and terminal will be supported for UHF and 2.4/5 GHz. Base stations will be precisely synchronized via the backhaul and will cooperate to fully support network functions such as handoff and localization.  ArgosNet will be digitally and mechanically reconfigurable with a default configuration of three outdoor base stations each with 108 antennas. It can be easily reconfigured to have fewer base stations each with more antennas or more base stations each with fewer antennas.  The research platform will be a new infrastructure deployed on the campus of Rice University.  The project will develop an open-access repository with the complete hardware and software design for ArgosNet?s many-antenna base station, as well as examples and a toolkit for rapid prototyping with ArgosNet so that other researchers can build similar research platforms at their own organizations.

812,"East Asia has drawn much attention of geoscientists due to its complicated zoo of tectonic activities: unique continent-continent collision of India and Asia, different styles of plate subduction, various types of hydrocarbon-bearing basin formation, widespread intracontinental rifting, intraplate volcanism and magamatism. Tracing the driving forces behind these tectonic activities is vital to understand how the ancient continental roots, continental and oceanic plates at the plate margins, and mantle flows underlying lithosphere interact amongst each other in a dynamic earth framework. It?s essential to obtain high-definition multi-parameter seismic images of the earth?s interior to test different hypotheses of the tectonic driving forces, such as crustal shortening or/and Indian plate underthrusting causing the uplift of ?the world?s roof?, the Tibetan Plateau, lower-mantle plume or/and dehydration from the stagnant slab in the mantle transition zone (410 ? 650 km depths) inducing hot mantle upwelling contributing to the intraplate volcano Changbaishan along the border of China and North Korea, and the Pacific slab subduction and rollback producing extension, transtension, and thinning of the lithosphere beneath the East China and opening of the marginal seas of Japan and South China. Seismic imaging in this study will map full waveforms of seismic records to render more realistic models representing the earth?s interior properties. The outcome will not only provide the independent and robust seismological constrains to test the end members of tectonic formation mechanism, but also shed new light on the composition, thermal state, flow and fabric structure of the lithosphere and upper mantle, which are complementary to geological, geochemical, petrological, and geodetic observations of East Asia.An unprecedented seismic waveform dataset recorded by very dense array stations in China and its surrounding regions will be used to image the crust and upper-mantle structure beneath the East Asia. This dataset is comprised of seismic records from the CEArray, the NECESSArray, the INDEPTH-IV Array, F-net and other global and regional seismic networks. Contrary to traditional ray-theory based seismic imaging, adjoint tomography of this study takes into account full 3D wave propagation effects and off-ray-path sensitivity. In this implementation, it utilizes a spectral-element method for precise wave propagation simulations. The tomographic method starts with a 3D initial model that combines the smooth radially anisotropic mantle model S362ANI with 3D crustal model Crust2.0 (potentially recently released Crust1.0 can be used for more accurate and higher resolution model refinement). Traveltime and amplitude misfits are minimized iteratively based on a conjugate gradient method, harnessing 3D finite-frequency kernels computed for each updated 3D model. The massively parallel simulations are carried out on XSEDE supercomputers available to the team via an existing XSEDE research allocation. The final models will allow close examination of seismic structures beneath different tectonic units of East Asia, and better understanding of how sub-surface processes shaping surface geology and tectonic features. The preliminary results already show strong correlations between heterogeneities in the crust and upper mantle with surface tectonic units, such as the Himalaya Block, the Tibetan Plateau, the Tarim Basin, the Ordos Block, and the Sichuan Basin. Narrow slab features emerge from the smooth initial model above the transition zone. 3D wavespeed variations in the preliminary model are either comparable to or sharper than high-frequency P- and S-wave tomographic images from previous studies. Additional iterations will be carried out to refine the 3D radially anisotropic models, and to resolve 3D azimuthal anisotropy and attenuation, which are closely related to mantle rheology and crustal and lithospheric strain rates and flow. This proposal will support one graduate student and one research scientist. The outcome of this research will also have a broader impact on understanding the linkage between 3D wavespeed heterogeneities and seismogenic processes. The more realistic high-definition models will help assess seismic hazard by providing more accurate ground motion maps, more robust slip predictions and rupture estimations on finite fault surfaces for future catastrophic earthquakes. The final models will be archived and distributed for quantitative studies in other fields of geoscience, such as geology, geochemistry, petrology, geodynamics and volcanology. With the existing 3D visualization lab facility at Rice, the earth models can be readily displayed to the public to promote earth science. Finally the results will enhance scientific communication between US and China and broaden future potential collaborations.

813,"The William Marsh Rice University project will work with middle school science teachers to design, field-test, refine, and evaluate a set of data management tools that will be embedded in a web-based science curriculum. The project helps middle school science teachers monitor their students' progress, plan lessons, and reflect on their lessons. The project consists of three primary phases: first, the researchers will work with teachers to develop an initial set of data tools; second, teachers will test these tools in their classroom to verify that they are feasible and usable; and third, a pilot study will be conducted to examine how the tools are implemented in the classroom and an external evaluation will determine the early impact of the tools. As part of this study, the research team will work with 125 middle school science teachers across three different school districts. Ultimately, the findings from this project will identify characteristics of data management tools that are more likely to be used effectively by teachers and have a positive impact on science teaching and learning.The project is employing a mixed methods design. Through design-based research, this project will help fill the need for research-based and teacher-driven design of online student management systems. During the first two years of the study, work will alternate between design/development and data collection, allowing the research team to collect and then incorporate teacher feedback into the tools' design. During these first two years, data will be collected through teacher surveys, interviews, and observations. The culmination of the project will be a one-year pilot, which will allow the research team to study the implementation of the final tools, and an independent evaluator from the University of Houston to evaluate the early impact of the tools on teaching practices and student achievement. The development and research proposed in this project will benefit teachers and students throughout the United States by improving what data teachers see about their students' progress in science and their own use of the curriculum.

814,"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program is funding the research of Kenton H. Whitmire of Rice University to develop new ways to make advanced metallic substances with potentially useful magnetic properties. The work is focusing on materials made from metals such as iron or manganese. When these metals are combined with a substance such as phosphorus, the two can come together in many different forms. Iron combined with phosphorus, for example, can form in at least five ways. All of these resulting substances are different, but they all are semiconductors, some of which display unusual behavior. One of these is called  magnetocaloric . This means their magnetic state varies with temperature. Substances like this could be used to produce an electronic refrigerator, in other words, a solid-state device that does not require the use of refrigerant gases. This work is, thus, having a broad impact: on the production of new and potentially important materials that will find a wide variety of uses in industry, and through the training of the next generation of scientists in advanced techniques for preparing specialized materials.This research is developing new ways to prepare advanced materials that are difficult or impossible to synthesize by conventional means. In order to achieve this goal, new molecular precursors combining one or more transition metals (M) with the group 15 elements (E) are being prepared. The resulting E-M compositions have important magnetic, electronic and/or superconducting properties. This project is geared to overcoming the synthetic challenges of preparing advanced materials of binary, ternary and higher transition metal/main group element compositions. The approach considers single source precursors based on transition metal carbonyl compounds containing one or more transition metals as well as phosphorus and/or arsenic. The molecular precursors are prepared using sophisticated organometallic techniques to achieve the desired E/M compositions. These compounds are characterized by a variety of methods including single crystal X-ray diffraction, multinuclear and variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry among others. The conversion of these precursors to the desired materials is examined by thermal decomposition methods. The resulting materials, prepared either as nanoparticles or thin films, are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, powder and film X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and other electronic and magnetic measurement techniques.

815,"In this two-year Postdoctoral Research Fellowship project, the fellow will investigate the history and mechanisms of continental break up in the Deep Galicia Basin offshore Spain in the Atlantic Ocean using the large 3-D wide-angle seismic dataset featuring 70 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) collected during summer 2013. Research results will improve understanding of how continents stretch and break apart, creating new ocean basins and leaving rifted margins at the trailing edge of continents. The fellow is hosted by the University of Southampton with sponsoring scientist Tim Minshull. Dale Sawyer, Rice University, also serves as a sponsoring scientist. The project involves collaboration with a large international group of scientists with extensive, multidisciplinary expertise in the USA, UK, Germany, Spain, and Portugal. Additional broader impacts include educational training for undergraduates, mentoring plans for a graduate student, and community outreach education events to further educate the public about rifting and continental breakup. This award was supported with funding from the Office of International and Integrative Activities.The objectives of the project are to determine the full 3-D structure and composition of the rifted Galician margin including the faulted continental blocks, thinned crust, and exhumed mantle and to understand the tectonic processes and evolution that created those structures. These structures are covered by the OBS grid within the seismic reflection 3-D box, which is 64 km (E-W) by 20 km (N-S). This project builds on traditional 2-D and 3-D travel-time tomography work already underway by using 3-D wide-angle full waveform inversion, a relatively new technique that yields higher resolution P-wave velocity models. Next upper mantle seismic anisotropy will be examined using P- and S-wave refractions. Understanding this complex marine tectonic environment requires the combined application of wide-angle and reflection data, as well as other geological and geophysical methods.

816,"PI: Link, Stephan Proposal Number: 1438634 Institution: William Marsh Rice UniversityTitle: Probing Dynamics and Structure of the Nanoparticle Protein Corona to Understand Its Impacts on Environmental Health and Safety The properties of nanoparticles (NPs) in biological fluids differ from their behavior in water due to the association of different proteins to the NP surface, forming a  protein corona  around the NPs. These proteins bind strongly to the NPs and affect the NPs' interactions with their environment. The goal of this proposal is to quantify the dynamics of proteins binding to NPs and to determine how the proteins may change their structure upon binding. The project will investigate model proteins, as well as proteins in blood plasma. The inclusion of experiments with whole plasma is an attractive feature of this proposed work, as whole plasma reflects the complexity of real-world conditions. The results of this research will be important for the understanding of the fate of nanoparticles, particularly, the bio-accumulation of nanoparticles in the food chain. In addition, understanding the dynamics of protein coating of NPs can be useful for the development of approaches that intentionally coat NPs with proteins in order to prevent other proteins from binding as a strategy to ensure that the NPs do not cause adverse effects on the environment. The PI and Co-PI are both active in outreach to the K-12 community and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students. While it is believed that the corona changes over time, as initially the most abundant proteins bind, but are then replaced with proteins that have the largest affinity, very little is known about the time scales of this dynamic exchange among different proteins. The goal of this proposal is to quantify the time-scales of protein-binding to NPs and to determine binding-induced structural changes of the proteins. Correlation spectroscopy will be used to determine the equilibrium protein-NP binding constant and number of bound proteins. The approach will be extended to measure competitive binding among different proteins to the same or possibly different nanoparticles. For protein folding/unfolding on NPs, the PIs will use CD spectroscopy on individual nanoparticles (with the goal of achieving single protein detection levels) and smFRET (single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer) microscopy of donor-acceptor labeled proteins.

819,"One of the major hurdles in the understanding of physiological processes and the design of new pharmaceutical drugs has been the understanding of the three-dimensional structure and flexibility of molecules, which hold key insight into their function and interactions. In many biological pathways conformational flexibility is known to play an essential role in driving functional mechanisms and has been the topic of both computational and experimental investigations. Modern experimental methods such as Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange coupled with Mass Spectroscopy (HDX-MS) can probe the flexibility of large proteins, but the findings are mapped on the available (static) crystal structures, thereby losing a considerable part of the dynamic information. This proposal will investigate the extent to which computational methods can help discover and visualize conformational changes of large proteins that are in agreement with experiment. Because of the specific proteins selected for study in the context of this proposal, the proposed work has a great societal impact: it helps advance the understanding of processes that are involved in a variety of immune, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, ischemic, and age-related diseases. This proposal will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students at Rice and the University of Pennsylvania on interdisciplinary topics. It will also provide training opportunities to women students. All work will be disseminated not only through technical presentations at national meetings, publications in peer reviewed journals and book chapters, but also through visits and talks with researchers in academia and the biotechnology industry, as well as with open source development and distribution of the algorithms developed for widespread use.A central part of this proposal concerns the development of a computational framework that samples the conformational space of proteins. It relies on a new representation of the degrees of freedom of proteins and protein complexes and on the definition of sampling primitives at various resolutions. The framework draws from geometry-inspired sampling techniques that efficiently explore large search spaces while keeping track of the extent that the search space is covered. In parallel, HDX-MS experiments will be carried out and used as probes for conformational variability. The experimental results will be correlated with the results of the computational framework to select the conformations that most closely match experiments. A distinguishing feature of this work is the connection with experiment and the ways in which each can feed the other. This proposal lies at the intersection of algorithms, computational geometry, dimensionality reduction, data mining, and visualization methods and connects with modern experimental methods which are actively under development and hold great promise for the understanding of protein structure and function.

820,"NON TECHNICAL ABSTRACTThis award from the Condensed Matter Physics program of the Division of Materials Research supports a project addressing the fundamental physical processes that give rise to novel phenomena such as high-transition temperature superconductivity. Superconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature.  Understanding of superconductivity and related properties will not only enhance our knowledge of basic science, but also gives us the ability to design materials with novel and predictable properties. The investigators conduct neutron scattering experiments performed mostly at the high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) and Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The project also utilizes other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at HFIR and SNS. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next generation of neutron scattering experts and elucidating the nature of the special properties of the correlated electron materials.TECHNICAL ABSTRACTThis award from the Condensed Matter Physics program of the Division of Materials Research  supports an experimental program integrating neutron scattering experiments with laboratory-based materials efforts, aimed at the fundamental understanding of spin excitations and their relationship with superconductivity in iron-based high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors. The objective of the project is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various phases in iron-based superconductors, specifically the iron arsenide superconductors BaFe2-xNixAs2, (B, K) Fe2A2, and BaFe2As2-xPx. The program has two components: initial materials characterization and neutron scattering. Single crystals of these materials are grown at the William Marsh Rice University where the initial characterization of will be performed. Neutron scattering, the core part of this research program, will be used to study the spin dynamical properties of these materials. Experiments will be performed at the High-Flux Isotope Reactor and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the NIST Center for Neutron Research in Maryland. In addition, other world-class neutron scattering facilities in Europe will also be utilized when similar capabilities are unavailable in the US. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next generation of neutron scattering experts and elucidating the nature of the special properties of the correlated electron materials. abstracting; Address; Award; base; Basic Science; Characteristics; design; Electrical Resistance; Electrons; Europe; High temperature of physical object; Iron; Isotopes; Knowledge; Laboratories; magnetic field; Maryland; Microscopic; Nature; Neutrons; next generation; novel; Phase; physical process; Physics; programs; Property; Research; Research Personnel; research study; Research Support; Rice; Source; superconductivity; Temperature; Training; Transition Temperature; UniversitiesNEUTRON SCATTERING STUDIES OF SPIN DYNAMICS IN IRON-BASED HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
821,"The 3-way symbiosis at the focus of this project is intriguing by virtue of the host plants gaining tolerance to soil temperatures of up to 125?F, a temperature at which most plants cannot grow. Plants survive this temperature due to their association with a particular fungus infected with a specific virus. Virally infected fungi living symbiotically with a host plant provide heat tolerance to a wide range of crop plants including tomato, corn, and rice. In a field trial, tomato plants harboring a fungal-viral symbiont showed improved growth and fruit production at elevated temperatures compared to non-infected plants. With the US economy losing more than $15 billion annually in crop production due to environmental factors, it will be potentially helpful to understand the mechanisms by which thermotolerance is induced in this virus-fugus-plant symbiosis. Insights gained from the research are likely to help in the development of methods to retain crop productivity in the face of high temperature stress. The project will provide hands-on multidisciplinary research training and educational opportunities for underrepresented minorities and first-generation college students at the University of West Alabama, a designated Minority Serving Institution. In addition, the project will include an educational outreach program for underprivileged K-12 students and adults through the Science Saturdays and Science Coffee Shop outreach programs, respectively. Finally, the physiological and molecular roles of fungal metabolites in stress tolerance will be of broad interest to the scientific community.In the geothermal soils of Yellowstone National Park, where temperatures can reach 65?C, a 3-way mutualistic association has evolved among panic grass (Dichanthelium lanuginosum) and a fungal endophyte (Curvularia protuberata) bearing a mycovirus, Curvularia thermotolerance virus (CThTV), which allows the 3 organisms to cooperatively survive extreme temperatures.  Metabolic analyses showed significant changes during stress in our model system tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) infected with C. protuberata. The data collected in those analyses provide strong evidence that fungal trehalose and melanin are essential for the heat-stress tolerance mechanisms conferred by the 3-way symbiosis. In addition, CThTV contributes to thermotolerance via its interaction with a fungal translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) and catalase/peroxidase (KatG), which control fungal cell cycle and cellular redox, respectively. The hypotheses of this research are that C. protuberata carrying CThTV confers thermotolerance in plants via: 1) production of large quantities of trehalose, which is transported into plant tissues and functions as a signalling or osmoprotectant molecule to regulate plant biochemical processes during stress; 2) fungal melanin, which likely alters fungal cell walls to control trehalose transport into and accumulation in plant tissues during stress; and 3) CThTV, promotes thermotolerance by interacting with fungal TCTP and KatG to control fungal cell cycle and cellular redox during stress. In particular, the proposed research is designed to test the involvement of fungal trehalose, melanin, TCTP, and KatG genes in thermotolerant tomato associated with fungal-viral symbionts. The aims of this study are to: 1) knock down the trehalose, melanin, TCTP, and KatG genes in thermotolerant C. protuberata-carrying CThTV, thermotolerance will be completely abolished in trehalose or melanin synthesis knock downs, and reduced by knocking down TCTP or KatG expression; and 2) overexpress the same genes in non-thermotolerant C. protuberata without CThTV, plants are expected to gain thermotolerance characteristics in the case of trehalose and melanin biosynthetic gene overexpression, and exhibit improved thermotolerance in the case of TCTP and KatG overexpression.

822,"Cornell University is awarded a grant to support the continued exponential growth of eBird, an online data resource for global bird biodiversity. With its launch in 2002, eBird opened a new era of live, online checklisting for birders, and it soon became one of the world's largest citizen-science projects. By 2012, eBird had amassed 100 million total bird observations, and early in 2014 that number is 170 million-on track to double the previous decade's worth of data in just 2 years. With more than 200,000 citizen-science participants worldwide, eBird acts as a global-scale, real-time bird monitoring mechanism that is innovating new models of conservation. For example, a first-of-its-kind conservation project in California is using eBird models to target the flooding of rice fields in the specific places, and at precisely the right times, for waterfowl and shorebirds during migration. eBird's openly available data has been downloaded by more than 6,000 students, educators, government staff, and researchers, resulting in more than 110 peer-reviewed scientific papers. True to its beginnings, eBird is still grounded in serving as an essential tool for birding. More than 7 million people access eBird every year to explore data through interactive exploration, visualization and analysis tools that help birders find more birds.Much of the research in basic and applied ecology is founded in descriptions of distribution and abundance of species. Long-term, well-organized data covering broad spatial scales are necessary for documenting change, generating hypotheses for their causes, and ultimately understanding how these changes relate to overall ecosystem health and function. While collecting a single-species occurrence datum is a well-understood process, the coordinated collection, curation, access, and storage of these data is no small task. Appropriately structured and sustained, the cyberinfrastructure that supports large species occurrence datasets can add value to the data, instead of merely acting as a tool for aggregating observations. The eBird data management infrastructure provides a unique resource for students, scientists, land managers, governments and amateurs. eBird's data: (1) come from a single, consistently gathered and curated source that is openly available and widely in use, (2) represents a substantial proportion of all available data on distribution of all organisms globally, and (3) provides these data in not just minimal form but as a set of value-added products that lower the threshold of data management needed to use these data.

823,"In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Isabell Thomann of Rice University is developing novel instrumentation to follow the often complex, multi-step reaction pathways of heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions that are relevant for solar fuel generation, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis in general. Femtosecond time-resolved Raman techniques will be developed to probe the chemical identities of short-lived reaction intermediates. These will be complemented by concomitant analyses of the reaction products via electrochemical mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Using these techniques, novel concepts for efficient carbon dioxide photoreduction will be investigated. Both plasmonic and dielectric photoelectrode nanostructures will be explored for their potential to open up distinctive reaction pathways and to overcome limited conversion efficiencies and product selectivities.The fundamental knowledge about photocatalytic reactions gained in this work will, among many other applications, aid in improving the selectivity and efficiency of CO2 reduction. The technological capabilities developed here will in addition serve to recruit, educate and train students (both undergraduate and graduate) in a highly interdisciplinary research field. As part of this award, an outreach program is being developed that includes opportunities for K12 teachers and undergraduates to learn about and contribute to this research in the Professor Thomann's lab.

824,"Anatoly Kolomeisky of Rice University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division to develop theoretical approaches to understand how proteins and DNA, the most important molecules in all living systems, interact with each other in supporting fundamental processes of life. Analyzing these processes at the molecular level requires novel theoretical and computational tools that are capable of describing the complexity of living systems. The project involves close collaboration with experimental research groups. High school students, undergraduates and graduate students, and postdoctoral associates participate in the research and receive invaluable training in an important and timely field. The project focuses on developing a fundamental theoretical framework for uncovering microscopic mechanisms of protein search for specific target sites on DNA molecules.  The role of various physical and chemical properties of DNA and proteins in these phenomena are tested using a combination of discrete-stochastic models and simulation techniques.  The theoretical predictions are tested using single-molecule spectroscopic studies, chemical kinetic experiments and advanced bioinformatics methods. An outreach program developed by Professor Kolomeisky for local high-school students provides the opportunity for them to learn and participate in real scientific work in an academic setting. The broader impacts of this project include a multi-disciplinary training program for young researchers of different levels that will prepare them better for future technological and industrial challenges.  In addition, the outreach program promotes advancements in our understanding of cellular processes that may lead to new medical drugs and bio-inspired materials.

825,"PI: Blake C. Meyers (University of Delaware)CoPIs: Virginia Walbot (Stanford University) and Greg Abrams (Texas Advanced Computing Center/University of Texas - Austin) Information generated from this project will provide new insights into the regulation of developmental events in the anther, the male reproductive organ, of maize and related grasses - crops that feed much of the world.  New insights and resources of broad utility should ultimately contribute to controlling plant fertility in agriculture, particularly in the cereal crops. The project builds and improves on the varied and extensive outreach and education components of the PIs and their contributions via scientific leadership to continue a strong, positive impact on local and scientific communities, and on the next generation of scientists. Implementation of the  Virtual Anther  will make the project data widely accessible while helping students and the public understand how anthers develop. An undergraduate-focused project to sequence and annotate a basal grass genome will provide invaluable data for the project and to all those employing phylogenomics analysis in flowering plants, while training the next generation of plant biologists. All project outcomes will be accessible to the research community through a project website and long-term repositories such as GEO and MaizeGDB. All biological resources such as antibodies, clones and vectors will be available upon request. Seed will be deposited and distributed long-term through the Maize Genetics Cooperative. Software for the  Virtual Anther  will be made open-source and available via the Texas Advanced Computing Center website (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-software/).Male sterility is a common phenotype in natural species, functioning as one mechanism to promote outcrossing. Furthermore, control of pollen production by plant breeders is a fundamental technology that continues to underpin hybrid seed production in many crops. In the agricultural context, there is also a growing concern over climate disruption: both heat and cold cause male sterility in crop plants. This study seeks to more broadly understand the coordination of anther development and underlying cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, as plant cells switch from mitosis to meiosis.  The specific goals are to: (1) organize hierarchies of gene expression in individual anther cell types and (2) elucidate functions of small RNAs, particularly two unusual classes of  phased  secondary small RNAs (phasiRNAs) that are highly enriched in grass anthers. These phasiRNAs are processed from an extensive set of coordinately-expressed long non-coding RNA precursors into secondary small RNAs of 21 or 24 nucleotides. Using precisely staged maize anthers and laser microdissected cell types, the project will generate copious transcriptomic and proteomic data, organize transcriptional hierarchies of transcription factors, generate extensive data on small RNAs in a spatiotemporal context, and analyze the function and biogenesis of phasiRNAs. Genetic analysis using existing and engineered mutations will be used to test for essential roles of key transcription and phasiRNA biogenesis factors in anther development. Genetic and  omics  experiments will test new hypotheses about phasiRNA functions in anther cells and in meiosis. Most of the analysis will be conducted in maize because of its exquisite developmental regularity, the large size and ease of anther dissection, and existing molecular and genetic knowledge about maize anthers. Key insights will be evaluated in rice to distinguish general and species-specific points, with additional comparisons to other grasses. To generate new hypotheses, all data will be integrated into a  Virtual Anther  visualization system.

Trick (Kansas State University), and Hairong Wei (Michigan Technological University, Houghton) Key Collaborator: Kan Wang (Iowa State University) Small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), play central roles in growth and development, epigenetics, genome integrity, defense against pathogen infection, and responses to environmental changes in plants. miRNAs are especially important in controlling plant development, productivity, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses by negatively regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Hundreds to thousands of miRNAs have been identified from dozens of plant species. However, their roles in plant development and response against various pathogens and other stresses are largely unknown.  This project will integrate the most recent cutting-edge genomics technology into the study of miRNAs in crop plants.  Students at all levels of education will be engaged in a variety of activities including teaching, training, learning workshops, and technology-extension. The project will provide research training in small tandem target mimic (STTM) technology, rice transformation, and functional studies of miRNAs for postdoctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students.  Underrepresented minorities and women, as well as students from the Upper Peninsula region of Great Lakes, will be targeted and recruited. The project will also organize and hold a training workshop in STTM construction.  The knowledge provided by this project will be disseminated to the public at large through informal talks at appropriate community venues. This work will address key mechanistic hypotheses regarding miRNA evolution by answering important questions: Why do plants need so many miRNAs? Are they essential? What are their functional conservation and diversification in different plant lineages? This project will develop miRNA  knockdown  populations in selected agriculturally important crops as a pilot project using the recently developed STTM technology. These mutant populations will be further used to investigate the functional conservation and diversification of six highly conserved families of plant miRNAs, and to study the regulatory role of miRNAs in plant-microbe interactions. The project will provide a resource database, application and service for web-based materials transfer and distribution.  All sequence data will be deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

827,"PI: Peter L. Morrell (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)CoPIs: Kevin P. Smith (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities) and Justin C. Fay (Washington University)Through examination of the prevalence of deleterious mutations, the project will address a longstanding issue of both theoretical and practical importance. Important crops such as barley, rice, soybeans, and wheat are inbreeding and deleterious mutations could be of greater consequence on yield in these crops, as the mutations will more frequently occur in the homozygous state in inbreds than in hybrid cultivars. Once identified, deleterious mutations can be eliminated through marker-assisted selection using genomics tools that are independent of the cost and inaccuracy of phenotyping to increase yield and reduce disease prevalence in crop plants. The barley system to be used in this study is ideally suited to translate our understanding of the nature and importance of deleterious mutations to application within a nationally organized and primarily public sector plant breeding community. USDA regional genotyping laboratories serve barley and wheat breeding programs across the country, using contemporary genotyping platforms to perform selection with informative SNPs. Several large collaborative research projects in barley are developing next generation mapping populations, a centralized trait and genotype database and analysis tools, and other resources that can be employed to further explore the role of deleterious mutations in barley. The public nature of the national barley breeding community will make application of this research in commercially relevant breeding lines broadly visible to the agricultural research community. This provides a uniquely open research system where results can serve as a model for other plant species that are used for food, fuel, and other natural products. Finally, the project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate student, and an undergraduate in crop genomics, evolutionary genetics, and computational biology. Through involvement with outreach programs at both universities, the project will engage students from populations underrepresented in the sciences.The research aims to characterize the potentially conflicting effects of self-fertilization and strong selection on the proportion of deleterious mutations harbored in individual plant genomes. Using resequencing of barley exomes from wild accessions, landraces (local cultivars), and modern elite (high yielding) inbred lines, the project will determine the extent to which selection for yield has affected the proportion of deleterious mutations present across genomes. Given sufficient population sizes, active selection of progeny that are more productive than either parent clearly has the potential to reduce the proportion of deleterious mutations present in elite lines. Nevertheless, strong selection for alleles that improve inbred lines or adaptation to agronomic environments may also increase the frequency of linked deleterious mutations. Genome-level comparisons will permit the identification of loci subject to artificial selection and estimation of the degree to which barley breeding programs have eliminated deleterious mutations across the genome while simultaneously contaminating the genome with deleterious mutations through hitchhiking at agriculturally important loci. All data generated in this project will be accessible through long-term repositories such as the NCBI SRA, GrainGenes and the Triticeae Toolbox (T3) database.

828,"The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is awarded a CAREER grant for the PI Michael Schatz to develop new computational methods for processing DNA sequencing data from the latest high-throughput sequencing technologies. DNA sequencing costs and throughput have improved by orders of magnitudes over the last three decades, although many questions remain unsolved, especially because of the short sequence lengths currently available. Emerging  third generation  sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences, Moleculo, Oxford Nanopore, and other companies are poised to revolutionize genomics by enabling the sequencing of long, individual molecules of DNA and RNA. The sequence lengths with these technologies can reach up to tens of thousands of nucleotides, however few or no analysis packages are capable of dealing with these types of genetic sequence data. This project will overcome these limitations by developing several novel analysis algorithms specifically for long read single molecule sequencing and their associated complex error models. The outcomes will help answer biological questions of profound significance to all of society, such as: What were the genetic implications of the domestication of rice? What genes and regulatory elements give rise to the incredible regenerative properties of the flatworm? or, What can be understood from assembling reference genomes of sugarcane and pineapple towards breeding more robust plant crops and biofuels?Specific objectives of the research include working towards assembling entire plant and animal chromosomes into complete, haplotype-phased sequences; identifying fusion genes and complex alternative splicing patterns responsible for diseases or adaptability; and searching for structural variations associated with improved crop yield or human diseases such as cancer or autism. Even if some future technology is capable of directly reading entire transcripts or entire genomes, this research will remain necessary to examine the higher level relationships across populations of genomes or in measuring the dynamics of gene expression and splicing.This project will tightly integrate research and education, promoting opportunities at high school through postdoctoral levels with the development of new course materials, hands-on research opportunities, and one-on-one mentoring experiences. This effort will specifically target the intersection of computer science and biology, promoting interdisciplinary education, and ensuring the next generation of scientists are ready for the complexities of quantitative and digital biology. To engage the widest possible audience, Dr Schatz  will also develop novel online teaching materials made available through a yearly bioinformatics contest. The first round of the contest reached nearly 1000 students around the world and at all levels of education, engaging students far beyond our physical limits. The products of the research will be made available as open-source software, and installed into the graphical iPlant Discovery Environment making them easily accessible to the large community of plant researcher around the world.

829,"Commercial production of the oak acorn as an animal feed crop offers the potential to help mitigate global climate change. Oak tree plantations could remove large quantities of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) from the atmosphere and store it for many decades as part of their biomass where it will not contribute to climate change. Also, such plantings would provide additional benefits in the form of windbreaks, watershed protection, and soil conservation. Little is known, however, about how to successfully cultivate acorns as a modern commercial crop, and it is therefore important to understand and document the knowledge in traditional systems of acorn production. Although acorns were once widely used in cultures throughout the northern hemisphere, the Korean Peninsula is one of the only remaining regions where acorns are still harvested in large quantities on a regular basis. In collaboration with Dr. Dowon Lee a noted expert on traditional Korean village groves at Seoul National University, this project aims to understand and document the traditional ecological knowledge associated with acorn production in the Republic of Korea.Oak groves were traditionally managed in rural villages to provide food in years when the rice harvest was poor, but now these groves are in danger of disappearing within the next hundred years due to urbanization and over-use. To document this traditional knowledge, in-depth field interviews of villagers, farmers, and others still involved in acorn production/processing will be conducted in the Republic of Korea. A lengthy questionnaire will be prepared used to guide the structured field interviews. Groves, techniques, tools, and materials will also be documented photographically. Sites will be chosen in conjunction with Dr. Lee to encompass a cross-section of the South Korean regions historically containing protected groves.

830,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: A recent discovery at the Colorado Center for Advanced Ceramics in the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering has demonstrated that commercial and new multicomponent glass can be made entirely from food or agricultural wastes with promising physical and chemical properties.  This represents one of the first demonstrations of making glasses and glass-ceramics from unusual and sustainable mineral sources. The global production of new glass (excluding recycled cullet (recycled broken or waste glass)) is about 100 million tons, with flat glass accounting for approximately 55 million of these metric tons. Flat glass is typically ~70 wt.% silica, and so using these figures, it can be calculated that 36.4 million metric tons of silica is needed to satisfy the global demand.  Concurrently one can consider the worldwide production of the main three grains consumed by humans in 2011 was 2,173 million tons worldwide. These grains (of rice, wheat, and corn) produce waste in the form of husks, stems, and cobs, and they are about one fifth of the total production by weight. This figure amounts to about 435 million tons of waste, which will on average be 15% silica. Therefore, using these figures, 65 million tons of silica could have been harvested from these three waste streams alone.  This project will explore the feasibility of using these organic waste streams to make glass. TECHNICAL DETAILS: The research project addresses the following objectives: 1) understanding the physical and chemical properties of these novel glasses, 2) examining the advantages, if any, these glasses have over those produced with mined minerals, and 3) expanding this approach to other material systems such as glass-ceramics and ceramics.  A post-doctoral associate is working closely with Dr. Cornejo in each of the steps.  Initially, they are creating a catalog of minerals suitable for glass formation from food/agricultural waste.  From suitable precursor materials, glasses that are chemically identical to commercial glasses are being synthesized.  The resulting surface properties are being characterized using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

831,"PI: Philip C. Bevilacqua (Penn State University)CoPIs: David H. Mathews (University of Rochester) and Sarah M. Assmann (Penn State University) Rice is a staple food for more than 1/3 of the world's population and the second most important crop in terms of global production. Given global population growth, limited resources of fresh water, and global warming, it is very important to develop stress-tolerant varieties of rice. This research has the potential to advance both basic and applied knowledge regarding how RNA structure regulates expression of diverse genes in response to abiotic stresses, information that may useful for crop improvement. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, this project will provide summer training for underrepresented high school students in math and sciences in collaboration with the SEECoS program (http://science.psu.edu/outreach/special-programs/seecos-summer-experience-in-the-eberly-college-of-science) at Penn State. This project will also contribute to a new training program for ethics at Penn State and to an ethics module on Genetic Manipulation. All project outcomes will be made available to the public. Sequence data will be available at http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/ and through long term repositories such as the NCBI-SRA, Galaxy, and the Single Nucleotide Resolution Nucleic Acid Structure Mapping (SNRNASM; http://snrnasm.bio.unc.edu/)website. Biological materials generated in this project will be available on request or through the Dale Bumpers National Rice Resource Center.When plants are subjected to drought, molecular crowding within cells is enhanced and osmolyte and K+ concentrations increase. Likewise, when plants are stressed from temperature, RNAs in cells are thermodynamically affected.  Taken together, these observations suggest that drought and temperature regulate RNA folding, and that RNA structure may play a central role in regulating gene expression and stress tolerance in rice. To evaluate the contribution of RNA structural changes to the regulation of gene expression in rice, this project will leverage, advance and apply recently developed in vivo and computational tools to reveal, on a genome-wide basis, how RNA folds in vivo in rice during drought and temperature stress.

832,"Proposal Number: 1351692Institution: William Marsh Rice UniversityPI: Kemere, Caleb T. Title: CAREER: Dynamic Deep Brain Stimulation: From Theory to TechnologiesDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is a remarkable treatment for later stages of Parkinson's disease and an emerging revolutionary therapy for other neurological and psychiatric disorders.  Currently DBS is employed in a static fashion, in the sense that stimulation intensity and frequency are manually adjusted.  However, the neural circuits of the brain are highly dynamic, so major advances to DBS therapy must be  dynamic  systems as well, with recording and processing neural signals in real-time and modulating the applied stimulation based on the dynamic state of the brain.  The overall goal of this project is to lay the scientific and technical foundations for dynamic DBS systems that will radically increase the efficacy of DBS in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.  The proposed studies are therefore significant in terms of advancing both basic science, by enabling new and faster experiments, and clinically, by accelerating the development and implementation of DBS therapies.  As part of education and outreach activities, high school, college and graduate students will be engaged in neuroengineering education and research by (i) using an engaging module to teach high school students basics of neurobiology theory and experiment; (ii) challenging college juniors to build their own rat DBS with power and size constraints; and (iii) teaching graduate students neural signal processing using recorded neural activity.The overall goal of this project is to advance the scientific and technical foundations for dynamic DBS systems that will radically increase the efficacy of DBS in existing indications and enable rapid development for other neurological and psychiatric disorders. As an initial target for innovation, this proposal focuses on DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson's disease.  The following specific aims are proposed. 1 Use new materials to develop joint stimulation and recording electrodes. Record the activity of cortico-striatal-thalamic neurons in healthy, diseased, and DBS-stimulated states during intentional movements. 2 Develop a latent variable model of the dynamics of neural activity during intentional movement. Build a rodent-scale dynamic DBS device that implements model-based, closed-loop dynamic stimulation. 3 Evaluate the effects of long-term dynamic DBS across large cohorts of animals using an automated, high-throughput behavioral monitoring system. The proposed studies are expected to lay the foundation for novel dynamic DBS therapies; generate new conceptualizations of the neural basis of motor symptoms and STN DBS therapy in Parkinson's disease; transition computational models of DBS from the current static approaches to ones that incorporate the time-varying nature of movement-related neural activity; and help discover the neuroprotective and non-motor effects of static and dynamic DBS.

833,"PI: Grande-Allen, Kathryn J.    Proposal Number: 1404008Institution: William Marsh Rice University Title: Stacked, paper-based culture models of heart valve layers: effects of hypoxia gradients and heterogeneous extracellular matrixHeart valve disease affects hundreds of thousands of people of all ages and socioeconomic classes worldwide.  Given the growing association of calcific aortic valve disease with aging, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, the treatment of just this disease alone represents significant health care costs now and in the future.  Currently, valve diseases can only be treated through surgical or interventional means; there is no pill one can take to prevent or reverse valve disease.  It is unclear exactly how valve diseases get started or how they worsen.  Since the interactions between the cells and the material surrounding the cells - like collagen and complex carbohydrates - appear to play an important role in the health of the valve, as well as in the diseases, the PI has developed a unique way to study these interactions. The use of advanced, innovative approaches to grow the valve cells in an environment mimicking a normal, healthy or diseased valve will provide significant new information on the fundamental biology of heart valves and will help understand the disease process and test new non-surgical therapies.  In addition, the goals and activities of this research will be distributed to a broad audience of students (ranging from high school to graduate school) as well as high school teachers.The function of heart valves is made possible by the unique microstructural arrangement of extracellular matrix (ECM) components within the tissue. Many groups including the PI's have begun to investigate how ECM fundamentally regulates valve cell and tissue behavior, often using 2D cell cultures and immunohistochemistry, but these methods can be time-consuming and provide limited insight into active tissue remodeling. Cell culture environments such as hydrogels or fibrous scaffolds constructed from ECM or synthetic polymers offer cells a 3D environment that can be highly biomimetic, but analysis of the cell behavior throughout the entire thickness of the 3D scaffold is challenging.  Thus, the proposed studies will evaluate the normal and pathological behavior of valvular ECM and valvular interstitial cells (VICs) using the new field of paper-based cell culture technology. In particular, stacks of paper impregnated with gel scaffolds are appealing for high throughput, automated analysis of cell behavior throughout the stack, and can be used to evaluate the effects of hypoxia. Indeed, this technology is exceptionally well suited to investigate VIC-ECM relationships. More specifically, this technology will be used to assemble stacks of papers - each impregnated with a different ECM-based gel scaffold - into a layered structure that mimics the heterogeneous layered structure of the heart valve. This method will allow several in-depth studies to examine the effects of certain types of extracellular matrix, the amount of oxygen the cells are receiving, and the heterogeneous layered nature of heart valves, on the phenotypic and signaling behavior of the valve cells.  These responses will be evaluated and compared for two original heart valve sources of the VICs (aortic vs. mitral valve).  The overall goal of the work is to evaluate the normal and pathological responses of VICs to ECM and hypoxia. It is expected that this unique experimental system will generate insight regarding the fundamental behavior of valve cells and how this behavior can be regulated, which will be impactful on developing new therapies for disease and the design of tissue engineered valves.

834,"This award provides support for the 2014 Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium that will take place at the University of Texas at Austin during  the Fall 2014 semester. The Symposium will focus on the area where probability theory, dynamical systems theory, spectral theory, and partial differential equations intersect and interact. The Symposium is a forum for regional specialists in mathematical physics and related areas of analysis to become familiar with the latest problems and present their own results; in addition it introduces young mathematicians to the current state of the subject. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration information, and an archive of the past symposium can be found at the website of the meeting: https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/tc/TeXAMP/TeXAMP-2014/TeXAMP-2014.htmlThe Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University, and the University of Texas at Austin. It is intended for the participation of around 50 people (including 25 non-local graduate students). The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have a chance to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium consists of 8 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. abstracting; Archives; Area; Area Analyses; austin; Award; Differential Equation; Educational workshop; experience; Faculty; falls; Feedback; graduate student; Internet; lectures; mathematical analysis; Mathematics; meetings; member; Physics; Probability Theory; Research Personnel; Rice; Specialist; Students; symposium; Systems Theory; Texas; theories; Underrepresented Minority; Universities; web site; WorkTEXAS ANALYSIS AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS SYMPOSIUM",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
835,"This award provides funding for a three year stardard award to support the continuation of a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Rice University, entitled,  RET Site: Nanotechnology Research Experience for Teachers , under the direction of Dr. Vicki Colvin and Dr. Carolyn Nichol. This program will help further the educational programs developed by Rice University's NSF funded Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC)entitled the Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) and will improve upon past success continuing to pursue the university's commitment to educational outreach and science innovation. To accomplish these tasks, the project team team will connect Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) teachers who serve students in Houston, Texas, with the outstanding nanotechnology research faculty and facilities at Rice. Providing curricular, content knowledge, and pedagogical support for these teachers as they translate their research experiences into novel and exciting activities for their students, the Rice team will use a  train the trainer  approach and offer a large platform of STEM Professional Development (PD) programs that allow a total of 36 RET  master  teachers (12 per year) to disseminate RET program outcomes to more than 300 teachers per year, thereby creating a robust network of knowledgeable leaders who will then instruct traditionally underserved students in the Houston area, fostering the STEM innovators of the future. Since the innovative developments at the nanoscale are integrated across biology, physics and chemistry, this program will provide teachers with new insights on basic science that is also well-aligned with Texas State standards and targets underserved teachers and schools. Rice will work closely with the Houston Independent School District (HISD) and the Aldine Independent School District (AISD), both urban and historically underrepresented minority school districts in South Texas. HISD is the largest school district in Texas and its student population is 88% Hispanic and African American. AISD's student population is 96% Hispanic and African American. The Rice PD programs have trained more than 1200 teachers from over 34 school districts since 2006. This scalable RET will reach 900 teachers over the next 3 years, impacting about 135,000 students. In addition, the outcomes of this RET will be broadly disseminated via symposiums at Rice, national meetings, and online via the TeachEngineering digital library, Nanoscience Center for Learning and Teaching (NCLT), and the Rice Excellence in Science Curriculum website.

836,"Rice/1341499Flow of glacial ice along the Siple Coast, West Antarctica, localizes into fast-flowing ice streams of 20-80 km width, moving at speeds of 100s of m/yr as the ice streams approach the sea. These ice streams are bordered by ridges of nearly stagnant ice and no topographic feature in the ice sheet bed has been identified as guiding that width, which instead seems to be chosen dynamically.  Using theoretical modeling and computational physics, this study aims to understand (1) the mechanical, hydrologic and thermal processes active within the ice streams, (2) the origin of the stream morphology and what controls the margin locations of the fast-flowing ice, and (3) how ice discharge from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will respond to climate-related changes in atmospheric and ocean temperatures and precipitation. Preliminary studies suggest that the margins of all active ice streams in the Siple Coast have substantial ?temperate zones?, i.e., ice is at the melting point for several dozens to hundreds of meters above the bed. Temperate ice contains melt water, and thus a first focus is to understand how water generation and transport near the bed in the shear margins might partially stabilize the margin locations and control the speed of ice discharge within the ice stream.The intellectual merit of these studies is that it will contribute to understanding what controls the channelization of ice flow in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and the rate at which its ice is discharged to the adjacent ocean. The broader impacts of the work are that advancing our knowledge of ice-stream dynamics is crucial for predicting how ice discharge will be impacted by future variations in atmospheric and ocean temperatures, ocean currents, precipitation, and solar radiation. Based on the results from this study, the investigators will attempt to develop a mathematical model of ice stream and their shear margins, that can be included in larger scale numerical simulations of ice sheet processes and climate models. This project will contribute to the training of two graduate students.This award does not have any field work in Antarctica.

837,"This award provides continued support for a successful 10-week summer REU site within the Statistics Department at Rice University for the study of Statistics and its applications. As the number of domestic graduate students in the Mathematical Sciences continues to decline, there is a critical need to develop human resources to continue supporting the United States' advantage in the world of science and technology. The Rice University Summer Institute of Statistics (RUSIS), now in its 10th year and fourth funding cycle, has been successful in encouraging students to pursue graduate degrees in Mathematics and Statistics. Roughly 85% of the students who have attended RUSIS and have graduated, are now doctoral students in Ph.D. programs around the country, and roughly 61% of them are members of underrepresented populations in Mathematics. RUSIS has accomplished this through intensive courses, close supervision of research projects, and visits to various research institutes and agencies in Houston. The program will train and mentor 12 (7 NSF- and 5 NSA-supported) selected underrepresented minority students and students with no easy access to a research experience at their institution, including community college students, through intensive core courses in probability, stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest; e.g. multiple comparisons, extreme value theory, multivariate survival analysis, risk-reliability-sustainability of complex infrastructure systems, artificial intelligence, statistical learning, statistical genetics, and general biostatistics. The RUSIS engages the students in research projects under close collaboration with faculty mentors, and with the objective of producing joint publications, when the summer work merits it. Students present their results at national meetings and they are mentored in the preparation and presentation of their talks. In addition, students meet with an advisory committee composed of top scientists and present their work to them. The RUSIS also teaches short courses on the use of Unix platforms, LaTeX, and software to be utilized for research purposes such as Mathematica, Splus and/or R, and Matlab. In addition, the program organizes student and faculty visits to scientific facilities (e.g., Biomathematics and Biostatistics at MD Anderson Cancer Center, NASA). Through informal meetings, the program discusses a variety of topics ranging from applying to Graduate School to career experiences by outstanding scientists, and discussion of cutting-edge topics in Statistics. The program evaluates and monitors the progress of students for seven years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their participation, and an annual evaluation of the program by the participating students and an external advisory committee is an integral and valuable part of the program. The investment is starting to produce concrete results. The first RUSIS alumnus received his Ph.D. during the summer of 2011 and is now an assistant professor of statistical sciences in a Ph.D. program. Several more are due to obtain their PhDs in the next few years.

838,"StaFest conference will be held on October 12, 2013 at Rice University. The StaFest is an annual event partially supported by the American Statistical Association through the Committee on Minorities in Statistics. This year, the International Year of Statistics, this event will be especially significant. The goal of the StatFest is to showcase the work by statisticians in all realms of human endeavors, and by doing so, to encourage undergraduate students -- mostly non-traditional and underrepresented -- to pursue graduate careers in the statistical sciences. In addition, opportunities for graduate fellowships are discussed in the context of opportunities for graduate work in specific institutions. These goals are achieved by gathering a cadre of dynamic speakers who are top researchers in their respective domains (government, industry, academia, etc.) who are able to transmit their enthusiasm for the statistical sciences. In addition, a panel of graduate students discusses more specifically opportunities, challenges, and anecdotes that can be helpful for the soon-to-be graduate students. The conference also offers plenty of one-on-one discussion opportunities between undergraduate students and professional statisticians through communitarian meals (breakfast, lunch, and two coffee breaks) and, for the first time in the history of StatFests, an undergraduate research poster session at the end of the day. Students that will be recruited from across Texas. Traditionally the StatFest has recruited students from institutions in the host city. But this year, due to the International Year of Statistics, it is envisioned that the event will have more of a regional impact rather than a local one. The conference will assemble a group of top professional statisticians from academia, industry and government to showcase their activities with the purpose of enticing undergraduate students to pursue graduate careers in the statistical sciences. Students, mostly from underrepresented groups in the statistical sciences, engage in conversations about, and learn about cutting edge problems and solutions in, various realms of scientific inquiry, and most importantly, students come to appreciate the fundamental role that the statistical sciences play in supporting and guiding the fundamental scientific research and in the process get interested in pursuing graduate careers. The StatFest continues to have a major positive impact on the decisions of undergraduate students regarding graduate work. As a substantial percentage of those students attending the StatFest are from underrepresented groups in the statistical sciences, the StatFest -- clearly and compellingly-- provides a launching platform for many underrepresented students. These efforts will have an impact in helping to alleviate the well-documented national critical need to train more students from underrepresented groups in postgraduate careers in the mathematical sciences.

839,"Short-lived but violent explosive episodes frequently occur during long-lived lava-forming eruptions at our larger volcanoes. Similar eruptions also occur during the build-up to or wind-down from powerful steady eruptions as seen at Mount Pinatubo in 1991. At least 24 such eruptions have occurred in the last 10 years in 12 different countries.  These eruptions had few warning signs but yet impacted nearby regions with large, growing populations. The novelty of this study is its focus on an exceptionally well-studied event at Novarupta volcano, Alaska in 1912, which was the largest explosive eruption in the last 100 years. Three powerful eruption pulses, over approximately 60 hours, were followed by a series of violent, short explosions ejecting blocks showing a diverse range of magma textures. These textures form 'fingerprints' to the processes that caused the change in style of activity at the volcano.  The project uses a variety of newly developed techniques to capture the rates of processes of gas release and escape in the shallow portions of the volcano's plumbing system.  The techniques have in common that they are microanalysis of features of the erupted material on scales of millimeters to micrometers.  They include 2D and 3D imaging of vesicles, i.e., the gas bubbles in the erupted material, and measurement of the residual gases in and the permeability of the blocks. The central aim of this study is to reconstruct the architecture of the shallow magma plumbing, and constrain the conditions that led to a transition from a powerful steady eruption style into a series of short unsteady pulsing explosions.The project will involve exchange of material, students and ideas between University of Hawaii at Manoa, University of California at Berkeley and Rice University with Universit? de Savoie, and Universit? d'Orl?ans, in France. Two new initiatives, Students to Schools and Teachers in the Field, are aimed at contact and dialog with school teachers and classes to motivate high school students to consider the earth sciences as a field of study in their undergraduate program.

842,"The investigator and her colleagues will organize and conduct a Summer Research Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics at the Hotel Galvez, in Galveston, Texas on June 1-4, 2014.  The 2014 SRC will be the 50th anniversary of that conference.  The SRC is an annual conference sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS).  Its purpose is to encourage the interchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in statistics and biostatistics, and to give motivation and direction to further research progress.  The project will focus on young researchers, placing them in close proximity to leaders in the field for person-to-person interactions in a manner not possible at most other meetings.  Speakers will present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups.  Under the travel support provided by this award students will attend and present their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced researchers.The Southern Regional Council on Statistics is a consortium of statistics and biostatistics programs in the South, stretching as far west as Texas and as far north as Maryland.  It currently has member programs at 43 universities in 14 states in the region.  This project will fund student participation in the 2014 Summer Research Conference (SRC) sponsored by SRCOS.  The meeting is particularly valuable for students and faculty from smaller regional schools at drivable distances, affording them the opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant national or international venues.

843,"All grasses produce spikelets, short branches bearing the florets, which produce the kernels or grain, and therefore much of the calories that feed the world. Maize, and closely related grasses, produce spikelets in pairs, doubling the number of kernels produced in contrast to other, more distantly related cereals, such as rice, wheat and barley, which produce spikelets singly. Understanding the molecular and developmental basis for paired spikelet formation is of great practical significance as this information could be used to double yield in cereals that produce single spikelets. Collaborative comparative genomic studies also provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand the molecular basis for the evolution of this derived trait. The identification of the suppressor of sessile spikelet (sos) loci in maize provides a breakthrough into the understanding of the formation of the paired spikelet. Molecular, cellular and developmental approaches will be used to dissect the function of Sos1.  Additional molecular and developmental studies of Sos2 and Sos3 will enable the identification of additional genes regulating paired spikelet formation. The paired spikelet is produced by a meristem called the spikelet pair meristem.  Meristems continually produce organs through balancing the functions of maintenance and determinacy. The Sos loci will enable the dissection of the interaction between these two fundamental developmental processes, as well as providing insight into the evolution of grass inflorescence architecture.This research involves collaboration between a maize developmental geneticist and an expert in the evolution of grasses, and hence is interdisciplinary in nature. One graduate student and at least six undergraduate students will be trained in the McSteen laboratory. A summer seminar series will be developed to provide training for undergraduates in understanding the broader implications of evolutionary studies in science, education, and society. The PI will also speak to the public on the domestication of corn.

844,"Subsistence self-sufficiency -- the ability of individuals in small traditional communities to feed themselves -- constitutes a major issue in many parts of the world today. In many regions where the potential for outside help is limited, malnutrition and starvation are recurring problems. This project utilizes an archaeological context, which can trace change over time and over climatic fluxuation, to examine the processes at work in one specific situation. Under the guidance of Dr. Benjamin Marwick, Seungki Kwak will analyze pottery collections from three major inland habitation sites in the central part of the Korean Peninsula: Sosa-Dong, Songguk-Ri, and Eupha-Ri. Low hills with gentle slopes embracing meandering rivers in this region were continuously occupied for as much as 4,000 years, and large inland habitation sites developed in this condition provide multiple lines of subsistence data that are required for this study. Mr. Kwak's research will investigate the subsistence strategy in the central part of the prehistoric Korean peninsula using organic geochemical analysis and luminescence dating on potsherds.The transition from foragers to farmers and the role of intensive rice agriculture have been among the most controversial subjects in Korean archaeology. However, the relatively high acidity of sediment in the Korean peninsula has made it impossible to examine faunal/floral remains directly for tracing the subsistence change. For this reason, many of the studies on the transition heavily relied on the shell middens in the coastal areas, which reflect only a small portion of the overall subsistence. The subsistence behaviors recorded in numerous large-scale inland habitation sites have been blurred by the strict dichotomy between hunter-gatherer and intensive rice farmer. The central hypothesis of this research is that there was a wide range of resource utilization along with rice farming around 3,400-2,000 BP. This hypothesis contrasts with prevailing rice-based models, where climatically driven intensive rice agriculture from 3,400 BP is thought to be the dominant subsistence strategy. The research will provide a unique opportunity to understand the subsistence in major inland sites through the direct examination of potteries: the most wide-spread material culture in the prehistoric Korea. Organic geochemical analyses will give information for identifying what was stored and cooked in the pots, and luminescence dating will be able to provide reliable dates that will directly indicate when the potteries were made. The combination of these methods will allow us to obtain a critical clue to understanding the complexity and variety of the subsistence over time and the role of the intensive rice farming.This research will seek to have a broader impact beyond the research topics presented. It will assist with building educational infrastructure about the ancient subsistence at the institutional level for both the general public and young generations (K -12). Public lectures related to the project will be provided on the archaeology day at the Burke Museum, University of Washington. Its data and results will be shared with the public through online archives. Through collaboration with the institutions in Korea, data will be shared with Korean scholars. The results will be published in Korean for the general public, and readers of young generations will be targeted. All of these efforts will promote international dissemination of the data and results. Lastly, this project will reinforce collaboration between archaeology and chemistry and help train the young scientists from those two different backgrounds who will be able to create a robust, innovative research program in archaeological organic geochemistry.

845,"In many areas such as signal processing, control, statistics, learning, inverse problems, and management,  large  data sets are often processed to find  small  solutions, those depending ultimately upon a small number of factors. Since these solutions tend to be sparse in a way, it is possible for methods that pick out the sparse solutions to find them from a reduced number of indirect measurements compared to what are usually considered necessary. This is the emerging technology of compressed sensing (CS). In this research, the PI proposes to study a broad range of issues and techniques to advance CS. His proposed reseach includes the introduction of new methodolgies for exploiting solution sparsity to accelerate CS computation, the development of algorithms that utilize operations requiring low storage and maintain robustness to noise and errors in data, and the discovery of efficient methods for minimizing the l1-norms of wide classes of functions such as first and higher-order differences. This project will include an integrated educational program involving a new course, one Ph.D. student, and the participation in the Rice-Houston AGEP program in producing competitive women and minority graduate students.The new emerging technology of  compressed sensing  is a complement to traditional data compression. While the traditional technology encodes digital data using fewer bits in order to save storage and transmission time, the new technology can significantly reduce the time, energy, and cost associated with the acquisition of digital data. This is achieved by acquiring digit information of an object of interest from a reduced number of obervations than what is usually necessary. For example, the life of an aeriel such as a space telescope can be greatly extended due to a lower sampling rate (and thus a lower power demand). Hyperspectral and infrared imaging devices can produce the same images with smaller sensors, or if with the same sensors, images at higher resolution. As such, the new technology can lead to breakthroughs for applications where the bottleneck lies in the high cost of data acquisition.

846,"PI: Sheng Luan (University of California, Berkeley)CoPI: Peggy Lemaux (University of California, Berkeley)Key Collaborators: Rod Wing (University of Arizona)and Bin Han (National Center for Gene Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences) Plant growth minimally requires sunlight, CO2, water, and minerals. While sunlight and CO2 are abundant, water and minerals are major limiting factors for crop production. Although extensive research effort has been directed to studying water use efficiency and drought tolerance, much less effort has been expended on understanding the mechanisms of plant nutrient use efficiency and tolerance to low-nutrient status in the soil. Not knowing how to increase nutrient use efficiency in crops resorts to heavy use of fertilizers, a practice that endangers environment and sustainable agriculture. The overall goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the gene networks responsible for high potassium (K)-use efficiency in cereal crops using genome-wide approaches. Rice is chosen as a model because of its rich genetic and genomic resources and its ease of transformation. The specific objectives are as follows: (1) to characterize the biological roles of all K-transporters encoded in the rice genome. As K+ is not metabolized, effective uptake and distribution of K+ hold the key for high K+ use efficiency in plants. Dissecting the roles of all K-transporters in rice will generate a  road map  of K+ movement throughout a cereal crop and provide possible ways to improve efficiency; (2) to identify genetic loci and individual genes associated with low-K tolerance in rice. Rice landraces display dramatic natural variations in low-K tolerance and such variations can be linked to genes using sequencing-based association mapping that would speed up the identifications of QTLs; (3) to conduct RNA-seq-based comparative transcriptome analysis and identify genes involved in low-K response and adaptation. By comparing transcriptomes of  highly tolerant  and  highly sensitive  landraces to the low-K condition, differentially expressed genes between the two phenotypic groups will be identified and their relevance to phenotypic variations will be scored; and (4) to integrate the datasets from Objectives 1-3 to assemble a gene regulatory network. This transformative knowledge will lay the foundation for marker-assisted classical breeding as well as genetic engineering approaches to improve K-use efficiency in cereal crops and reduce the use of fertilizers in crop production.  A number of broader impacts to society and education will be achieved. Rice is one of the most important food crops, feeding more than half of the world's population. Understanding the mechanisms of low-K tolerance in rice will provide a knowledge base for breeding rice varieties (and other cereals) that produce high yield with minimal fertilizer use, protecting environment and contributing to sustainability of agriculture. This project integrates undergraduate and graduate education into all aspects of the research. Outreach activities will be undertaken that include training of underserved high school and community college students through collaboration with Biotech Partners and STEM program to introduce these students to modern biology techniques and knowledge with the goal of increasing their interest in science careers. All sequence data and annotations will be accessible through the Rice Genome Annotation Project (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/).

847,"Selection is an important tool for genetic analysis and plant transformation.  The most widely used selection approach involves resistance to antibiotics such as kanamycin or to herbicides such as BASTA.  Although quite effective, these selection tools present problems involving toxicity as well as low regulatory and public acceptability.  This EAGER project proposes to develop a new selectable marker system for crop plants based on the alteration of cellular properties within the apical meristems. The system will be based on complementing through transgenes non-essential deficiencies in selected developmental mutants. The system will provide multiple advantages including lower cytotoxicity, easier application of targeted modifications, reduced risk of marker escape, and improved consumer acceptance and regulatory compliance.  Aim 1 will use a characterized Arabidopsis regulatory pathway to demonstrate basic feasibility.  Aim 2 will identify and complement mutations in new genes in Arabidopsis, tomato and rice to test their suitability for this system.  The final aim 3 will explore the use of forward screens for identifying suitable mutations among plant exhibiting specific phenotypes. The project expects to demonstrate the application of this novel system in the Arabidopsis model system and then extend its use to at least one crop species.  Since the original reports of plant transformation nearly 30 years ago, the search for selectable markers that would overcome the drawbacks of antibiotic/herbicide resistance has been intense. This marker system has the potential to revolutionize the way plant scientists approach transformation for basic research and for crop improvement. The research proposed here follows a radically new approach and will use naturally existing plant genes; thus, products generated by this method will more likely be accepted by consumers and approved by regulatory agencies.  If successful, the methods will be made available on the laboratory's web site at http://comailab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/index.php/ Data methods.

848,"Meadow fescue and tall fescue support significant livestock industries, and red fescue is one of the most important turf species in the Northern hemisphere. These grasses cover significant acreage in temperate zones worldwide. All contribute to social, economic and environmental targets at regional and national scales. They also have the ability to associate with aboveground fungal endophytes, and significant international seed companies already exist that manipulate the presence and strain of endophyte present to achieve various agronomic goals. Recent research has shown these symbioses also have the capacity to alter soil-to-atmosphere greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and increase soil carbon sequestration - important ecosystem services that have been under-studied by researchers and not considered for technological development. Therefore, discovering grass-endophyte combinations, within each of these grass species, that simultaneously reduce grassland GHG contributions and stimulate carbon sequestration could contribute to international GHG reduction goals, as well as, potentially increasing profitability and other important ecosystem services these land cover types provide. The aim of this research is to evaluate the ability of these grass species and several currently available fungal endophytes for effects on soil-to-atmosphere GHG fluxes and soil carbon sequestration in Finland, Spain, and the United States.Utilizing existing stands of the grass species in the various locations, which are either endophyte infected or endophyte free, we will measure soil-to-atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes using static chambers and syringe gas collection which is then run on a gas chromatograph for quantification of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. We will take soil samples (0-10 cm) at the beginning and end of the study and measure soil organic carbon using an elemental analyzer. This project will generate the first dataset of its kind: an international effort quantifying the effects of grass-fungal endophyte symbioses on GHG production and soil carbon sequestration. Our results will be relevant to a number of countries, where the grass-endophyte combinations we study currently occur. If certain grass-endophyte combinations prove more effective than others at reducing GHG and promoting soil carbon sequestration, adoption of these &#39;new&#39; suites of species, a.k.a. &#39;symbiotically modified organisms&#39; (Gundel et al. 2013), could occur quickly, as users are already familiar with this technology, the seed industry is in place to assist with the transfer, and grass-endophyte technologies lack the issues surrounding genetically modified organisms. In addition to improving the sustainability of grasslands and reducing their GHG contributions, such a discovery could have relevance for other agricultural crops, where endophyte symbionts are currently being explored as ways to improve environmental stress tolerance (e.g., corn and rice; Redman et al. 2011). Furthermore, the grass species we will be evaluating are important turfgrass species, used worldwide in sport fields, amenity and ornamental applications. Because fungal endophytes are currently used to improve turfgrass cultivars of these species, the results of this project will provide useful information regarding how turfgrass in human environments potentially contribute to carbon sequestration and GHG mitigation (Selhorst and Lal 2013).

850,"The goal of the project is to develop and implement a cost-effective, sustainable management program in rice for the invasive Mexican rice borer (MRB, Eoreuma loftini) that is compatible with management programs for the existing complex of rice pests, including the rice water weevil, the sugarcane borer, and sheath blight. The MRB is a destructive pest of graminaceous crops that has invaded the major rice-producing regions of Louisiana and Texas. Continued range expansion of the pest threatens other important crop-producing regions in the southern U.S. Objectives are proposed to investigate new tactics for MRB management (e.g., silicon fertilization, multiple pest-resistant varieties, crop tolerance) as well as optimize tactics already in use (e.g., chlorantraniliprole seed treatments, foliar insecticides). Additional experiments are proposed to quantify yield impacts of MRB infestation in rice and to investigate plant-mediated interactions among the MRB and established pests. A diverse set of extension activities are proposed to educate stakeholders about the MRB management program, increase grower involvement in monitoring, and evaluate adoption of IPM tactics. The expected outcome of the project is a coordinated set of multi-tactic management programs for the pest complex in rice that will be adopted by growers in areas where the MRB has invaded or will invade. The project will advance the science of IPM by addressing the issue of integration in IPM, and will help train the next generation of IPM practitioners by involving a graduate student in the proposed activities.

851,"Irrigated rice is planted in half the world&#39;s rice fields, and produces about 75% of theworld&#39;s rice supply. In adaptation to climate pressures in coming decades this irrigatedrice will, however, need to be produced with less water. There is a risk that underalternative irrigation management (AIM) N2O emission offsets the reduction of CH4emission when N fertilizer is applied at a high rate. A particular challenge is to upscale theoften detailed field observations of full greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets to regional ornational scales.

854,"In the Anishinaabe-Ojibwe community to speak of natural resources and the environment is to speak of plants and animals, but also of livelihood opportunities, identify use and preservation, culture and story, and spiritual teaching eminating from our connection to the earth and water. To say that Anishinaabe culture has eroded is to imply that our connections to our natural resources have eroded. It is the intent of the Thirteen Moons program to addresses this issue and the need to establish a Tribal Extension Program organized around natural resources as an essential step toward connecting individuals to natural resources by increasing their awareness of and knowledge about the protection and use of our resources.

855,"The discovery that many fruit juices and brown rice syrup contain significant concentrations of arsenic or heavy metals such as lead and cadmium has raised concern amongst the public, government regulators, and food and juice producers. This contamination occurs both from natural and anthropogenic sources such as industrial pollution, arsenical herbicides and pesticides etc. While the levels of the contaminants are sufficiently low to not result in acute poisoning, chronic exposure at levels above those deemed unsafe by the EPA may result in health problems. In particular, young nervous systems are markedly sensitive to heavy metal exposure. Juice purification is extremely challenging since it is a complex blend of nutrients, minerals, flavors, polyphenols, antioxidants, etc. It is very difficult to remove the undesirable species and leave the beneficial ones untouched. The high acidity of juice (e.g. apple juice pH is 3.35 - 4.00 and grape juice pH is 3.4-3.8) also makes purification a challenge since many of the technologies for treating water fail at low pH or result in the dissolution of the sorbents in the juice. Therefore, there is a strong need for novel highly efficient, low-cost, and selective methods for removal of toxic metals and arsenic from juice. Such technologies are the target of this proposal.XploSafe&#39;s proposed technology includes a mineral that exchanges a healthy, beneficial ion (calcium) very selectively for the heavy metal. These mineral have a high capacity for heavy metals. Unlike heavy metals, arsenic is present in juice as inorganic or organic oxides that are usually anionic thus the treatment method must be different. XploSafe has developed a metal oxide/gelatin composite that has high affinity for arsenic (as arsenite, arsenate, methylarsenate, and dimethylarsenate), performs well at pH as low as 3.0, and can be readily synthesized in the form of beads for columns that rapidly remove arsenic from juice.Overall, the proposed solution for removal of heavy metals and arsenic from juice are low-cost, easy to operate, minimize production of undesirable residuals and energy use, and can facilely produce juice that is nutritious and safe for consumption by the public. The proposed research will ensure that the new technologies do not add any foreign or deleterious materials into the juice and that they do not alter the nutrition or quality of the juice. The Phase I research will determine the capacity and rate of uptake of lead, cadmium, and arsenic species from juice and form the basis for scaling to pilot and commercial scale in Phase II (in collaboration with a juice processing company). The product will be extremely beneficial to juice processors, juice packers and juice blenders. Producers and processors of rice products such as brown or white rice, rice cakes, rice milk, rice syrup etc. and producers of baby foods stand to benefit from the proposed technology.

856,"The U.S. is a major rice producer and exporter, and insect infestation of milled rice causes considerable economic loss from reduced grain quality, treatment costs, and risk of insects and fragments in consumer food. Due to the phase-out of the fumigant methyl bromide, insect integrated pest management (IPM) plans specific for rice mills are critical to maintaining product quality and economic viability. Red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is the primary pest in rice mills, and is the most frequently targeted pest for methyl bromide fumigations under the continuing use exemption program for rice mills.Rice insect management typically treats established infestations, but immigration from outside sources has been demonstrated. Therefore, shifting the focus toward prevention could improve overall program efficacy. We propose to develop an IPM plan for red flour beetles at milling facilities using alternative methods to methyl bromide. Results will also be applicable to other insects. We will evaluate the role outside spillage plays in attracting and retaining insects, and evaluate how targeted applications of reduced-risk insecticides and improved sanitation of spillage improves pest prevention programs. The economic costs, benefits, and risks of current and new management tactics will be analyzed and results integrated into a web-based management system that will be applicable to all phases of post-harvest rice IPM. Recommendations will be delivered through workshops and stakeholders encouraged to adopt best management strategies. The project will provide alternatives to methyl bromide fumigation for red flour beetle control in rice mills.

858,"We study a class of biological molecules called  small RNAs  that regulate cellular activities by suppressing gene activity. This project will characterize the biogenesis, regulation, and functional roles of small RNAs from important crop and model systems. The species of interest include selected eudicots such as soybean, tomato, or fruit trees, as well as selected cereals including rice and maize. This diversity of target of species will allow us to examine and compare small RNAs across species to identify commonalities and differences. We are particularly interested in a class of small RNAs known as 'phased siRNAs' because they have unique gene regulatory roles, and can be mobile within the plant. Small RNAs are known to have key roles in plant development and responses to stress, and thus their activities can be useful markers to characterize germplasm diversity and it's response to stress conditions. These small RNAs may regulate other genes during the response to these important stresses or developmental patterns. We postulate that some of these small RNAs will be conserved in plant species, and we will test this hypothesis by evaluating several examples from the NPGS using standard techniques. This project has the potential to improve the utility of germplasm in the NPGS with important and novel genetic information about traits of agronomic interest.

859,"We showed that DME is required for all DNA demethylation in Arabidopsis endosperm. Our preliminary results strongly argue that the demethylation of maternally inherited chromosomes in rice endosperm is mediated by one or more glycosylases homologous to DME. The rice DME homolog ROS1a is expressed during sexual development, and a mutation of this gene causes strong male and female sterility, suggesting that ROS1a participates in endosperm demethylation. The stronger phenotype of ros1a, compared to dme, is consistent with the more extensive regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation in rice compared to Arabidopsis. We will examine the effect of the ros1a mutation on endosperm DNA methylation to determine the role of ROS1a in maternal demethylation. The ros1a mutation will also allow us to confirm that DNA methylation directly regulates the genes and sRNA loci whose expression is correlated with endosperm demethylation. Our preliminary results indicate that rice cultivars exhibit extensive variation of DNA methylation and sRNA patterns that is likely to significantly impact gene expression, including that of imprinted endosperm genes. Characterization of this epigenetic variation and its influence on gene expression is therefore a necessary complement to the characterization of genetic variation. Furthermore, rice hybrids are of major agricultural importance, but we do not understand how the distinct epigenomes of divergent parents interact in hybrids. For example, we do not know if and how sRNAs produced from one of the parental genomes alter DNA methylation of the other. Profiling of DNA methylation, sRNA, and gene expression in diverse rice cultivars will allow us to determine how epigenetic variation shapes gene expression. Doing the same in the F1 seeds of selected hybrids will enable us to trace the evolution of genomic imprinting, and will more generally allow us to examine how divergent epigenomes interact in endosperm and embryo. Furthermore, we will extensively characterize the F1 hybrid progeny for physiological traits of agronomic importance that comprise hybrid vigor, whilst paying particular attention to phenotypic differences between the progeny of reciprocal crosses, which might be due to the expression of imprinted genes.

Understanding the ecology of key pest taxa is critical to identify opportunities for effective and sustainable management intervention. A combination of field and laboratory studies will be used in this project to better understand the mechanisms by which insect pests impact rice production and the environmental circumstances influencing pest and beneficial insects. The information generated from this project will help producers in Arkansas and other rice growing regions of the US to be more efficient in their production practices and reduce the environmental impacts of rice production, thereby enabling them to be more competitive. In addition, the knowledge and methods developed in this project will also be of value to other rice producing regions and contribute to the general understanding of insect-plant interactions in agricultural systems.

862,"The past 5-years has seen tangible progress in the global development of commercial-scale biorefineries to convert agricultural residues such as wheat straw, rice straw and corn stover to biofuels. The first commercial biorefinery in the world was commissioned just this year (2013) in Crescentino, Italy. This facility, currently projected to produce 20 million gallons of bioethanol a year from wheat straw, was built by a partnership between Beta Renewables and Novozymes, Inc. Construction on at least two commercial-scale biofuels facilities are currently underway in Iowa by POET and Dupont. California has a rich resource of agricultural crop residues that can be used as feedstock for conversion to biofuels and bioproducts (1). Two of the leading companies in the push to establish the biorefinery industry, Novozymes and Dupont, have a strong presence in California. A tremendous opportunity exists for local production of biofuels from agricultural residues in California. The incorporation of cellulosic biofuels into the nation&#39;s liquid fuel portfolio is congressionally mandated as part of the Renewable Fuels Standard (2). The technological challenge, however, lies in the recalcitrance of cellulosic substrates to degradation (3). The state of technology relies on energy and chemically intensive pretreatments to aid in the breakdown of such substrates to fermentable sugars (4). Cellulosic (also termed &#39;lignocellulosic&#39;) substrates are chemical and structural complex. Moreover, cellulases and other complementary enzymes that breakdown the substrate into fermentable sugars are not fully characterized and understood. Taken together, the saccharification reaction (enzymatically breaking down lignocellulosic biomass to sugars) is not yet predictable and is challenging and costly to scale-up. This project seeks to further understanding on the mechanisms underlying enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass to ensure the future of biorefineries. Our studies include investigating cellulase-cellulose interactions and the origins of the resistance of cellulose to degradation and the nano- and micro-scale, investigating the mechanisms of common biomass pretreatment and processing strategies in improving enzyme digestibility of biomass and investigating the impact of biomass properties on saccharification challenges at high solids loadings (low water inputs).

863,"Rice is a major crop of the United States, with rice production valued at $2.98 billion in 2012. After rice is harvested, it is stored as rough rice in large storage bins on-farm or in commercial storage bins. It is then moved periodically to rice mills where it is processed as various products including brown rice, milled white rice and rice flour. As rice is stored and milled, it can be infested by a number of stored-product insects, greatly reducing the quality of the product. Insect pests of stored grains include the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica), red flour beetles (Tribolium casteneum), Indianmeal moths (Plodia interpunctella), warehouse beetles (Trogoderma variable) and other insects. These insects can either attack the whole kernel or they can attack the rice that is milled, and the byproducts of milling. There have been many studies conducted on the biology of stored-product insects in wheat. However, there are very few studies on insects associated with post-harvest rice, especially pertaining to the development and biology of insects infesting rice and rice milling components. Studies are needed so relevant integrated pest managementstrategies can be used at rice storage and milling facilities. The goal of this project is to understand the biological attributes of various stored-product insects associated with stored rice and milled rice fractions. Specific objectives will be toexamine the development of stored-product insects on various rice milling components (rough rice, bran, hulls, brown rice, white rice, broken rice and rice flour) using strains collected from rice mills/rice storage facilities in Arkansas; to determine the development of lesser grain borer and other stored-product insects on flora native to habitats in Arkansas and to determine if forested environments allow a refuge for stored-product pests. Understanding the biological requirements for insects associated with rice would allow for a strong foundation to develop IPM programs for the rice industry.

864,"The delta region of Arkansas is highly diversified in production systems with major crops being rice, cotton, corn, wheat, and soybeans. Of the applied nutrients, nitrogen is one of the most widely used. It is required to optimize productivity but is also becoming a greater concern in respect to ground and surface water quality. Changes in management inputs within crop production systems may be altered to increase the efficiency of use and the subsequent potential loss of nitrogen to the environment. The potential of nitrate leaching has not been fully evaluated within the delta of Arkansas. The development of tools to assist growers in decision making is important. Diversification in production systems within this region will also require an evaluation of the risk associated with nitrogen use. Models are an important tool so this project will evaluate the Nitrogen Loss and Environmental Assessment Package (NLEAP) as a farm management tool. Evaluate a number of production systems with major crops in the Arkansas delta in respect to the efficiency of use, post-harvest distribution, and potential loss of nitrogen. The evaluation of the cropping systems will include both conventional and conservation tillage systems and available sources of nitrogen.

865,"Flooding and drought are major damaging constraints to soybean production in the U.S. In Missouri, Arkansas, and Mississippi, approximately 50% of the soybean acreage is affected by flooding annually. US soybean production is also largely influenced by drought since more than 85% of soybean is produced by rain-fed farming. In Virginia, soybean is a major field crop (580,000 acres in 2012), but its productivity has been negatively affected by various environmental stresses including drought and flooding. Despite the economic impact of water-related stress in the major legume, fundamental mechanisms that regulate submergence and drought tolerance are largely unknown, presumably because the entire genome sequence and molecular tools were not available until recently. As a postdoctoral researcher, Takeshi Fukao led the USDA-NIFA-funded Sub1 Rice Project (2003-2012) exploring the mechanisms of submergence and drought tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) with Prof. Julia Bailey-Serres at UC Riverside. Fukao has successfully adapted molecular protocols established in Arabidopsis for rice research and characterized the master regulator of submergence tolerance, SUBMERGENCE-1A (SUB1A), at physiological, molecular, and genomic levels (Fukao et al., 2006; Fukao and Bailey-Serres, 2008; Fukao et al., 2009; Fukao et al., 2011; Fukao et al., 2012). In this project, his advanced understanding of stress survival strategies in rice and Arabidopsis will be applied to increase the adaptability of soybean to extremes in precipitation under changing climate conditions. His ultimate goal is systematic elucidation of the intricate regulatory networks that govern adaptation and tolerance to an excess and insufficiency of water in the major legume species, aiding to enhance submergence and drought tolerance in commercially important soybean varieties in Virginia and other states.

866,"Developing transgenic crops with multiple genes is important for effective weed and pest management. Traditional transformation methods are generally impractical for multigene introduction because these methods often introduce more than one copy (or truncated copies) of genes into random sites, leading to silencing of one or more genes. New methods that can precisely add foreign genes into a chosen site can simplify multigene transformation. This approach is referred to as  molecular stacking , and can be achieved either by inserting a single DNA fragment containing multiple genes or inserting genes one by one. There are several outstanding questions, such as, what is the stability if the multigene locus and which molecular tools would be efficient in developing a gene stacking approach.

867,"Increased consumer demand for agricultural products with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and continued pressure from government has put pressure on row crop producers to reduce emissions associated with crop production. Comprehensive, U.S. climate change legislation had never been closer to law than the House passage of Waxman-Markey bill in 2008. Despite the death of the bill in the Senate, the White House, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continue to support carbon reduction initiatives. Perhaps more importantly, agricultural producers face increasing demand from private industry to reduce GHG emissions associated with crop production. Wal-Mart has announced a potential plan to label each of its products with a sustainability rating and has subsequently requested that every Wal-Mart supplier provide its GHG footprint, a direct measure of climate impact. In response to these pressures, agricultural producers and processors seek to increase production efficiency with respect to GHG emissions. Unlike consumer driven or politically mandated climate change legislation the changes in climatic conditions will also force producers to deal with greater weather variability and from that greater disease and yield variability. This research is holistic in the sense that it deals with climate change both from a proactive and reactive view. Reactively, the impacts of various carbon polices on row crop producers in the Delta and globally will be estimated. Proactively, this project will estimate how climate change itself with increased climatic variability will affect row crop producers and give some mitigation suggestions. Likewise, this project will analyze developing issues (political, climatic and agronomic) facing agricultural producers globally. Current climate change models project mean global temperature increases between 1.8 &deg;C and 4 &deg;C by the end of the century (IPCC, 2007). Increases of even the lower magnitude of these estimates could result in current notions of extreme temperatures and extreme variations becoming the norm, and future  extreme  temperatures becoming catastrophic to crop production (notably rice production in the US and abroad). Climate change therefore threatens roughly the one billion people who depend on rice cultivation as their primary source of income, and the food security of roughly the 3.5 billion people who depend on rice for more than 20 percent of their daily caloric intake (IRRI, 2012). In contrast to Asia, rice production plays a relatively small role in U.S. food security with rice consumption accounting for less than three percent of daily caloric intake. Despite being the world&#39;s 10th largest rice producer by volume and area (FAOSTAT), the relatively low domestic demand for rice allows the U.S. to export approximately half of its domestic production, making it the fourth largest rice exporter (USDA-ERS). Thus, the United States plays a substantial role in a very thinly traded international market. The thin nature of the international rice market means that any shocks to U.S. rice production such as a case of extreme heat can dramatically impact international price levels, sending ripples through the Asian rice markets where stable consumption is so critical. Given its global significance in terms of food security any decrease in supply or increase price send ripples worldwide. For example, in 2008, when rice prices tripled, the World Bank estimated that an additional 100 million people were pushed into poverty (IRRI 2011).

868,"The overriding goal of this project is to understand fungal biology and parasitism. This work spans the realms of basic biology, tool and technology development, functional and evolutionary genomics, and the application of molecular biology tools in support of applied research. The study will be done on the model fungus Magnaporthe oryzae - the causal agent of rice blast disease. For this fungus, all the tools and technologies necessary for advanced molecular and genomic studies are available and routinely used in my laboratory. In the post-genome era, a major challenge is to understand the identity and control of each gene and the targets of each transcription factor. This could not be more true for understanding the molecular basis of fungal pathogenicity. The genome sequences of many fungi are now available, as are growing data sets of large-scale transcriptional and metabolomics studies. Microarray analysis reveals that specific sets of genes are coordinately regulated, presumably via the action of largely uncharacterized transcription factors. Through guilt by association, this provides a clue to the function of co-regulated genes as well as provides a means to categorize groups of genes. The M. oryzae system is particularly well-advanced to begin to define the genes and networks underpinning infection related development and host associations. We know that certain environmental stimuli, for example on an inductive surface or in the presence of a particular chemical cue, germinating spores will produce appressoria and express a particular set of genes. Likewise, different sets of genes are expressed in a mutant unable to form appressoria or grown in non-inducing environments. Thus we have a working knowledge of the architecture of some of the essential systems. In this project, we will use high throughput genomic approaches to identify key genes involved in pathogenicity in M. oryzae.

870,"a. The Asian needle ant, Pachycondyla chinensis (Emery), is an invasive pest in the Southeastern United States that has established as a pest in urban environments. Its range has extended from the first reports in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia to most eastern states (Smith 1934, MacGown 2009, Paysen 2007, Gu&eacute;nard and Dunn 2010). In those areas where it is established, populations are large and in some cases, it is displacing other invasive species such as the Argentine ant which occupies a similar niche (Spicer and Silverman 2013). Research results also have demonstrated a strong negative impact on native ant species abundance and diversity in hardwood forests (Paysen 2007, Gu&eacute;nard and Dunn 2010), particularly native species responsible for seed dispersal (Paysen 2007, Rodriguez-Cabal et al. 2011). In addition to its pest status and the impact it may have on biodiversity of native species, Pachycondyla chinensis poses a public health threat. The number of sting cases by P. chinensis and public awareness of this species has increased since it was first documented in the US (Nelder et al. 2006, Jackson 2012). In addition, allergic reactions in humans are recognized by entomologists and a growing number in the general public are aware that an Asian needle ant sting may be dangerous to highly allergic individuals. However, we do not know the extent of the problem. We speculate that in many areas of the Southeast when a person is stung by an ant, the sting is attributed to the red imported fire ant because of its prevalence and notoriety. Determining how frequently people are stung by the Asian needle ant, determining the frequency of stings, and classifying the range of allergic reactions are important components to further increasing awareness in public and medical communities. Progress on defining effective control strategies has been made and is based primarily on targeted treatment to nest sites. Bait products, which cause high mortality in P. chinensis, have been identified in laboratory studies, but none have proven effective in the field during periods of peak activity in the field (Mo 2013). While Spicer Rice et al. (2012) reported effective control of P. chinensis using hydramethylnon bait their study was conducted from August to October when P. chinensis colonies are naturally declining. There are factors that may contribute to poor baiting success. Among them, P. chinensis exhibits behaviors not commonly found in other invasive species, but which may contribute to poor outcomes for implementing management strategies using baits. For example, several nest sites are commonly found in close proximity, but nest cohorts may not interact with each other due to agonistic behavior or foraging strategies that do not include wide-scale recruitment to the same food resource. This species also exhibits tandem carrying behavior which is uncommon in the major pest ant species. In the literature, it has largely been attributed to foraging activities in most ant groups. However, in the lab we have identified other purposes for the behavior, and think it is a possible detriment to colony management. b. Proposed research on evaluation of the efficacy of new technologies for controlling arthropod pests (ants, cockroaches, crickets, beetles, termites, spiders, etc.) in the urban environment will be pursued on the basis of available funding. Over the past 30 years, chemical industry funding to conduct lab and field trials has been an important source of revenue for supporting graduate student stipends and research, and lab technicians. It also affords an opportunity for our students and me to gain practical experience with the products and techniques used by the pest control industry that we serve with our research results and Extension programs.

Research is needed to increase the global competitiveness of the U.S. agricultural production system (USDA REE Strategic Plan). One well-known aspect of increasing this competitiveness is to enhance plant biological efficiency. Another aspect is to use biological knowledge to limit the effects of environmentaland biotic (insects and diseases) stresses on crop plants. For each aspect, options are available as to the manner in which the advantage in efficiency or stress resistance is achieved. We can improve the varieties used for production and/or the production system. In reality, these two approaches overlap, which falls into the realm of applied plant physiology, i.e., utilization of our understanding of how the plant functions to enhance yield potential, maximize yield for a given situation, or maintain yield while improving efficiency of crop management. The Objectives of the project are to a) discover agronomic principles underlying production practices and deliver economically superior production and management systems for crop production in the Upper Gulf Coast and other areas of highly mechanized cropping systems in the sub-tropics; b) discover physiological principles underlying production practices and deliver economically superior production and management systems for crop production in the Upper Gulf Coast and other areas of highly mechanized cropping systems in the sub-tropics, along with selected international crop production areas; c) discover physiological principles underlying crop response to natural and manipulated environmental factors of the mid-southern U.S. and similar climates around the world, and deliver management practices for economically minimizing the effects of these factors on crop yield within the context of complex systems knowledge; d)discover physiological principles underlying production practices and deliver economically superior production and management systems for bioenergy cropping in the Upper Gulf Coast region and other areas of highly mechanized cropping systems in the sub-tropics, including developingmulti-crop strategies for spreading delivery of biofeedstocks to biorefineries, and including coordinating the above into regional planning to develop a bioenergy-based sector of a regional economy; e)chemically evaluate key developmental stages of rice, grasses, canes or industrial crops to advance the integration of the biochemical or physiological and molecular aspects of development; and f)develop new technologies enabling population- and landscape-level analyses in plant community ecophysiology and dynamic control of crop inputs. The approaches of the project are somewhat diverse, but, in general, are: a) improve agronomic understanding of the bases of rice and other crop productivity, and incrementally apply and transfer this knowledge for gradual improvement in the economics of rice and other crop production in the region and similar production zones around the world; b) improve physiological understanding of the bases of rice productivity, and incrementally apply and transfer this knowledge for gradual improvement in potential and realized rice yields of the Upper Gulf Coast region and in selected production areas around the world, and additionally to document research conducted on cotton and multiple crops; c) conduct research on the plant physiological effects of high temperatures, variation in spectral quality (such as alteration in ultraviolet radiation), and continue project development on plant physiological effects, as relevant to crop production, of industrial waste products recycled to the land; d) conduct research defining physiological and biochemical constraints to biomass and bioproduct yield of grasses/canes and other industrial crops, and use this information to determine crop combinations that optimize producer profitability and provide consistent availability of biofeedstocks to local biorefineries, including coordination with research addressing other topics necessary for establishing bioenergy in regional economies; e) examine key aspects of plant development using modern chemical approaches that easily integrate with molecular characterization of development, such as functional genomics; this approach will include picking and choosing critical aspects from diverse crops open to rapid progress, and using crop plants that are also potential model species; and f) incorporate small sensing and control networks into plant physiology/ecophysiology studies, then expanding these to small field studies, to wireless systems, and for monitoring additional environmental factors with time. .

872,"Based on the type of relationship with the host, plant viruses can be grouped as acute or persistent. Acute viruses are well studied and cause symptoms and plant diseases. In contrast to acute viruses, persistent viruses do not appear to affect the phenotype of the plant host. The genus Endornavirus contains persistent viruses that infect plants without causing visible symptoms. Infections by endornaviruses have been reported in many economically important crops, such as avocado, barley, common bean, melon, pepper, and rice. However, little is known about the effect they have on their hosts. The overall objective of the proposed project is to elucidate the nature of the symbiotic interaction between endornaviruses and their hosts. Some specific objectives include (a) developing endornavirus-infected and endornavirus-free Black Turtle Soup common bean and Marengo bell pepper, (b) to evaluate the phenotype, grain and fruit yield of endornavirus-free and endornavirus-infected isogenic lines under greenhouse conditions, and (c) to study the interactions between selected acute viruses and endornaviruses. It is likely that the endornaviruses of bell pepper and common bean are in a mutualistic relationship with the host and provide tolerance to biotic or abiotic agents. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the endornaviruses could interact synergistically with acute viruses and indirectly or directly cause harmful effects. Therefore, the addition or elimination of endornaviruses from some crop germplasm will be an action that will have to be taken.

873,"Agricultural productivity will need to increase in the next fifty years to meet the increasing population demands. However, we will need to achieve this increase in the background of a changing environment. Farmers are already experiencing extremes in conditions of temperature, storms, and drought. Therefore, crop plants will need to be able to adapt to extended environmental stress while still maintaining yield. In addition to extreme weather patterns another impact from climate change is an increase in nighttime temperatures. This increase in nighttime temperature could have unexpected consequences on plant growth and response to stress through the alteration of the plant circadian clock. We are investigating the role of increased nighttime temperatures in regulating response to osmotic stresses such as drought and salinity in rice plants. Research into how plants respond to these osmotic stresses has revealed that it is a complex network where many different signals are integrated to determine the type of response. Our approach is to break that complex network apart by controlling for the factor of time in our analysis.Like humans, plants have an internal clock that enables them to coordinate their daily activities with their environment. In plants, this internal clock can be set not only by light/dark cycles in the day/night, but also by temperature cycles (warm days and cold nights). We are comparing the regulation in response to stress that occurs when rice plants have access to only signals from light/dark cycles to stress responses in rice plants that have access to both light/dark and warm/cold cycles. We are using RNA-seq to look at the entire rice response in these different conditions at different times of day. We are using computational approaches that enable us to determine the contribution of time (whether a plant is more responsive to stress in the morning or at night) and the contribution of the environment (day/night vs warm/cold cycles). From this analysis we will determine where in the stress response network time and the daily light and temperature cycle play a role. We will identify markers that will allow us to investigate the potential effects that the loss of nighttime temperature can have on plant growth and yield. Beyond the basic science, this research can have substantial impacts on agriculture in a changing climate. Markers for sensitivity to temperature cycles can be identified. The determination of the conditions that provide the most sensitive response could drive alterations in management practices such as when to irrigate. Although this research is performed in rice to access the genetic tools for manipulation, we expect the results to be applicable to other crop species.

874,"Plants differ in their capacity to grow at and survive low temperatures. At one extreme are tropical-climate cereals such as maize and rice that suffer chilling injury when exposed to 10oC. At the other extreme are the temperate-climate cereals including barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum spp.), and rye (Secale cereal) capable of surviving the temperate-climate winter. This ability to survive the temperate-climate winter is known as winter hardiness. Wheat, barley, and rye are generally classified as being of either a winter or a spring growth habit. Spring growth habit types are inherently reproductively competent and are typically sown in the spring. In comparison, winter growth habit types are sown in the autumn. They grow vegetatively for a short period before overwintering and then develop reproductively the following spring. If spring-sown they fail to properly develop reproductively. Spring and winter growth habit types also differ from one another in their ability to survive the temperate-climate winter. Typically winter growth habit types are able to survive colder temperatures than spring types and have greater winter hardiness. Winter genotypes are often preferred because they are capable of returning yields 40% greater than that of their spring counterparts. Winter genotypes are also much more efficient at making use of available water due to an extended vegetative growth phase and a much more extensive root system over spring genotypes. In Ohio and other states of the East North Central Midwest, winter barley and winter wheats are essential components in the crop rotation cycle with maize and soybean. Spring types have not been recommended for Ohio as conditions early in the spring are erratic leading to unpredictable and generally poor yields. Recent studies in wheat and barley have led to the identification of several key factors underlying the molecular basis of winter hardiness. These studies also reveal that expression of the genes underlying these factors are themselves affected by developmental programming inherent to the genetic makeup of the plant, and by environmental factors. Moreover, current data strongly supports the premise that the key factors act antagonistic to one another. It is these phenomena and the genetic basis underlying them that I am working to better understand. A goal of the work proposed here is to gain greater insight into their regulation, to better understand the nature of this interaction between the factors, and how their regulation is affected by the environment. These studies will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to enhance the productivity and freezing tolerance of cereal plants.

875,"Crop production must double by 2050 to meet global demands due to population growth and animal and biofuel consumption. However, for the last two decades, global crop yield has only increased from 0.9 to 1.6% in corn, soybean, rice, and wheat; insufficient to meet predicted needs. Alternatives are needed. The U.S. supplies 33% of the world&#39;s soybean production. In Louisiana, soybean accounted for 23% of the total agricultural production, with soybean production valued at $408 million.A recent survey conducted inLouisiana has shown that the number of acres scouted and the number of insecticide applications has doubled over the last four years. Losses due to insecticide applications and insect damage averaged $41.22 per acre. Thus, soybean producers will likely be more risk-averse, unwilling to suffer grain quality and yield losses due to insect pests. An effective and sustainable soybean IPM will be necessary to reduce pest impacts while increasing productivity.To implement this plan, knowledge on pest biology, host range, and population dynamics is necessary. Louisiana soybean is attacked by a diverse insect pest complex, but the primary problems in recent years have been associated with stink bugs, threecornered alfalfa hoppers, bean leaf beetle, and several Lepidopteran defoliators (velvetbean caterpillar, soybean looper, corn earworm, and green cloverworm). In addition, kudzu bug reached Louisiana in 2013. One or more of these pests are significant annual problems and are responsible for limiting soybean yields in Louisiana. This is an evolving system and new management tactics are needed to combat a changing pest assemblage. This project utilizes short and long term objectives to generate the necessary data on pest density, impact, biology, and control tactics that are critical to improve the overall soybean IPM program.

876,"Southwest Louisiana, composing primarily the lower portion of four river basins - the Sabine, Calcasieu, Mermentau, and Vermillion River Basins, is home to over 1,000,000 Louisianans. It is an intensive agricultural region with high productivity of rice, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, cotton, dairy, and crawfish, making an important contribution to the state&#39;s economy. Reports have documented considerable effects of sediment and nutrient runoff from the cropping systems and dairies on adjacent streams in the region. Southwest Louisiana is also among the most highly concentrated areas of oil and gas industries in the nation. Contaminants associated with petroleum production have the potential to affect the water resources of the region. Locating on the Gulf coast, the region encompasses one of the world&#39;s largest Chenier plains, a unique coastal formation that provides critical ecosystem functions. The vast and intrinsic waterways in the region serve as wildlife habitats and stopovers for migrating birds, attracting people from the region and nation to fish, hunt, and observe wildlife. There are, however, concerns over potential release of toxic chemical compounds from petrochemical production into the waterways and coastal estuaries. These include trace metals, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and hydrogen sulfide, emissions of which can occur during oil production and refinery processes. These chemical compounds are known to have harmful effects on human central nervous system and aquatic life, and media contaminated with these chemicals have been found to include air, water, and soil. This project will conduct intensive testing of waters and sediments in the region&#39;s major rivers. The project will determine current levels of nutrients, heavy metals, and toxic chemical compounds in the water bodies, assess seasonal trend, transport and fate of the pollutants to coastal estuaries from the rivers, and investigate long-term changes in the pollutants.

877,"The Lower Mississippi River Valley (LMRV) is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States, generating nearly $6.8 billion/yr in revenue and employing nearly 100,000. More than 3 million ha of irrigated cropland exist there, making it also one of the most heavily irrigated regions in the U.S. The Mississippi River Valley Alluvial (MRVA) aquifer supplies about 90% of this irrigation water, and its water withdrawal rate of 9,290 Mgal/d ranks second only to the High Plains aquifer (17,500 Mgal/d) in terms of irrigation use. In portions of Arkansas and Mississippi, the aquifer is declining at rates ranging from 0.15 to &gt; 0.45 m per year. At the same time, a growing human population, climate destabilization, and rising production input costs will all combine to further increase demand for irrigation in coming years, exacerbating aquifer overdraft. Improved irrigation efficiency will be central to any comprehensive approach to meeting future agricultural water needs in Mississippi. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop water- and energy-conserving systems for row crops in Mississippi. Emphasis will be placed on the 2:1 soybean (Glycine max)-rice (Oryza sativa) rotation that has a combined annual economic valuation &ge; $ 600 million. This particular rotation also currently consumes approximately 2 million A-ft irrigation water per season, representing about one-half of the water currently removed from the MRVA aquifer for irrigation in Mississippi. Thus, improvements in irrigation use efficiency in this rotation could have meaningful impacts on the on-going overdraft of the MRVA aquifer. However, research suggests that adoption of improved irrigation technology alone will not necessarily result in long-term resource conservation, indicating that human nature must also be factored into any comprehensive approach to reducing water use. As such, this research will seek to combine behavioral science with improved crop management, and irrigation and communication technologies, as part of a comprehensive approach to managing the MRVA aquifer in Mississippi.

878,"Changes in domestic agricultural and economic policies; regulations and market developments; along with structural changes in production and marketing are major factors influencing the international competitiveness of the U.S food and agricultural sector. The U.S. is a major supplier to the rest of the world of wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, rice, beef, fruit, vegetable, nuts, feeder cattle, poultry, pork and dairy products. U.S. agricultural exports rose from $82.2 billion to $135.8 from 2007 to 2012.

Weed management in these crops in the midsouthern United States relies on chemical control tactics. The evolution of glyphosate-resistant weeds has created a need for modifying herbicide programs in Mississippi. Currently, eight weed species in Mississippi have been identified as glyphosate resistant. Glyphosate resistance directly affects corn and cotton production and has indirect effects on rice cultivation in the state. Moreover, barnyardgrass resistance to acetolactate synthase inhibiting herbicides poses a serious threat to the sustainability of rice production in Mississippi. It is imperative to formulate new recommendations based on the most economical weed management systems to combat these growing problems.

880,"Spores, pollen and seeds are specialized storage structures where gametophytes or embryos can remain viable during extended periods of quiescence, often in a desiccated state. In response to rehydration or some other signal, the gametophytes or embryos undergo a burst of rapid development and differentiation, either for the production of gametes or for the growth of a new sporophyte. Large quantities of proteins and mRNAs are typically made and packaged into stable complexes prior to entry into quiescence. The control of rapid development involves the utilization of these stored proteins and the translation of these stored mRNAs in a precise spatial and temporal sequence. We are interested in the mechanisms that control rapid development and cell fate determination in the male gametophyte of the semi-aquatic fern, Marsilea vestita. This organism is native to California, and is commonly found at the edges of ponds and vernal pools. It can also be found growing in rice paddies (where it is perceived as a weed). The sporophyte undergoes a gradual drying process at the end of its natural life cycle and produces microspores (and megaspores) that persist in a desiccated state within a hardened sporocarp for many years. Upon rehydration, the microspores enter a precise developmental program involving a series of nine mitotic division cycles to produce 7 sterile cells and 32 spermatids, at precise times and in precise locations inside the spore wall. The spermatids then differentiate into multiciliated spermatozoids that look nothing like any other cell in the organism. We have shown that this process is regulated post-transcriptionally, and relies heavily on the unmasking, processing and translation of many types of stored mRNAs. These mechanisms of emergence from dormancy are highly conserved in widely divergent organisms. In this project, we will focus on how mRNAs are processed and translated in a precise way to facilitate rapid cellular differentiation in a simple and experimentally tractable fern gametophyte.

881,"The world population is now estimated to be over 7 billion with another billion to be added by the year 2024. Such a projected population increase will tax available food supplies and hence, significant improvements in crop yields are urgently needed to fulfill this future demand. Yield improvements are especially needed for the cereals, which provide the caloric and dietary needs for much of the world&#39;s population. Such efforts faces considerable challenges in that improvements in cereal yields have nearly plateaued in recent years. Moreover, this problem is exasperated by the added barriers of reduction in arable land, climate change mediated by increases in atmospheric CO2, and limiting water availability. This project is designed to aid in efforts to increase the quantity and quality of cereals as a food. Cereal seeds utilize the endosperm as their principal storage compartment for nitrogen and carbon reserves. These reserves are mainly in the form of storage proteins (nitrogen) and starch (carbon). Although the biosynthesis of these macromolecules appears to be unrelated and independent events, genetic evidence indicates that they are inter-related processes. Although the basis for this inter-relationship remains unclear, the knowledge gained from this project will aid our understanding on how these apparently biochemically unrelated processes are linked and may lead to novel approaches on enhancing the accumulation of these storage reserves as a means to increase grain yields and food quality.Efficient synthesis and accumulation of seed storage proteins requires the targeted localization of their RNAs to distinct subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. Past studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that the targeting of storage protein RNAs requires the presence of small cis-sequences which are recognized by a multitude of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Co-immunprecipitation studies will be carried out to determine whether the identified RBPs are arranged into multi-protein complexes, which may be involved in one or more steps in RNA transport and localization. The association of RBPs into multi-protein complexes will be validated using yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analyses. The role of the RBPs in RNA localization will be determined by evaluation of mutants and by suppressing the expression of the RBP genes using a transgenic approach. RNAs that are bound by these RBPs will be identified by isolating RNA fractions from immunoprecipitates and conducting RNA-sequencing studies. Results from these studies are likely to provide new insights on the number of RNA transport pathways and what RNAs share a common pathway. The latter information may provide clues on the potential relationship between storage protein and starch metabolism during seed development.Efforts will be continued to determine the 3-D structure of the starch regulatory enzyme ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase). Crystals have been generated, although not of sufficient quality for structural determination, and further studies are required for optimization. Isothermal titration calorimetry will be carried out to determine whether the enzyme&#39;s large subunit is capable of binding substrates and effectors. The RNAs expressed in transgenic rice seeds that over-produce starch and those from starch-deficient rice seeds will be elucidated. Results from the transgenic starch-overproducing line may provide insights on the processes that limit further increases in starch production while analysis of the starch-deficient mutant will provide new insights on the processes that are affected by the loss of starch biosynthesis. The role of the L80 peptide, a unique domain of the higher plant Phosphorylase I (Pho1) will be assessed by expression of wildtype and L80-deleted PhoI in transgenic phoI-deficient plants. Results from these studies will show whether this unique structural domain is required for starch initiation and/or maturation. 3-Dimensional; Affect; Anabolism; atmospheric carbon dioxide; base; Calorimetry; Carbon; Cereals; climate change; design; Development; Diet; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Enzymes; Evaluation; Event; Face; Fluorescence; Food; food quality; Food Supply; Future; Genes; Genetic; Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase; insight; Knowledge; Laboratory Study; Lead; Link; macromolecule; Mediating; Metabolism; Molecular; Muscle Form Glycogen Phosphorylase; mutant; Nitrogen; novel strategies; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Phosphorylases; Plants; Population; Process; Production; protein complex; Proteins; Rice; RNA; RNA Binding; RNA Sequences; RNA Transport; RNA-Binding Proteins; Role; Seeds; Starch; Structure; Taxes; Titrations; Transgenic Organisms; Vascular Plant; Water; yeast two hybrid system; YeastsMOLECULAR AND CELLULAR STUDIES ON NITROGEN AND CARBON STORAGE METABOLISM IN CEREALS",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,3.2034144038016256e-06,1e-06
882,"Effective management of grain in the entire value chain, especially during post-harvest processing, is critical to mitigate current food safety/security concerns, particularly those related to mycotoxin contamination of grain and co-products. Mycotoxins, especially aflatoxin, are known carcinogens that pose a severe health hazard to human and animal consumers of grains and co-products.Freshly-harvested, high-moisture content grain must be dried to minimize (or prevent) excessive respiration and mold growth on grains. At present, most on-farm systems which use either natural air or slightly-heated air to dry grain are becoming very popular. With these systems, the grain could be dried more slowly which generally results in improved quality and also the drying practice reduces pressure on commercial driers. Although drying practice with on-farm systems can lead to very positive results, they are weather dependent and unfortunately could lead to over drying of grain, fissured kernels that reduce milling yields, result in loss of functional performance, nutritional and sensorial quality of the grain and even development of harmful molds in areas of the bin that incur delays prior to drying. In particular, the development of mycotoxin-producing mold leading to mycotoxin contamination of stored grain in the on-farm systems has become a great concern to the grain industry.Recently-introduced technology for use in on-farm drying systems offers a means to utilize the advantages of low-temperature, in-bin drying systems, yet prevent the disadvantages that are sometimes incurred. The new technology is governed by the principle of Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC), which is the moisture content that a specific grain will attain if exposed to air with a given relative humidity and temperature for a long enough duration. Grain dried by continuous fan operation would be exposed to multiple drying/rewetting processes due to changing hourly/daily weather, resulting in inefficient and non-uniform drying. Natural air/low temperature (NA/LT) drying with fan operation in a given EMC window restricts the delivery of air that is too wet and/or too dry. The new NA/LT in-bin technology comprises cables to monitor not only air ambient conditions, but also grain moisture content and temperature throughout the entire grain bin mass and the data can also be accessed anytime via the internet. The systems have advanced fan and heater controls or self-adapting variable heat (SAVH) capability, which automatically adjusts the upper and lower EMC windows throughout the drying process, minimizing fan run-time hours and over drying costs, as well as moisture content non-uniformity.These new in-bin systems are becoming very popular and have great potential for wider adoption by many farmers. However, the duration required to achieve drying with the new systems is greatly affected by prevailing weather conditions (temperature and relative humidity). The real problem is that the weather may not allow drying of the grain, particularly the upper layers, in a timely manner. When this happens, there is a great possibility for mold growth in the grain mass, with potential mycotoxin development, and grain quality related problems such as loss of grades, functional performance, nutritional and sensory value may ensue as well. For instance, across the U.S. Mid-South, prevailing weather conditions will dictate the upper moisture content limit of grains that can be stored in these new in-bin drying/storage systems without significant  quality  deterioration and mold growth leading to mycotoxin development. The term  quality  could mean desirable characteristics for effective further processing and/or end-use. It is vital to know, for instance in the case of rice, how rapid grain  quality  attributes, such as grain yellowing, hardness, dry matter loss/respiration, milling, nutritional, functional (e.g. paste viscosity, stickiness, cohesiveness etc.) and sensory related characteristics change under prolonged high-MC conditions; and for the case of soybean destined for seed, how germination rate is impacted under different drying and storage conditions.The primary and practical questions the research will seek to answer for successful implementation of the new in-bin systems in Arkansas and the Mid-South are as follows: (1) what is the rate of grain  quality  reduction and mycotoxin development under various drying/storage scenarios; (2) with respect to stored product  quality , what is the upper moisture content limit for grain (rice, corn, sorghum, and soybean) placed into these systems at various locations; (3) what energy savings could be realized with these new in-bin drying/storage systems?

883,"Improving rice nutritional value is important since rice feeds nearly a half of the world&#39;s population. Annually, rice alone provides nearly 34 million metric tons of protein, which is about half of the total protein provided by legumes. Rice is the main component of diets in many parts of the world, including Asia. In these regions, widespread malnutrition occurs. High protein rice can be used as a vehicle to remediate malnutrition problems worldwide through both humanitarian missions or can be tailored into specific products to meet the needs for individuals and human populations as a whole. Improving the protein content in rice is the first general objective of this state project. The second general objective is the development of herbicide-resistant rice. Current Clearfield technology is very effective in controlling red rice,a major weed in rice. Its sustainability has become of concern due to field outcrossing between Clearfield rice with red rice. A new type of herbicide-resistant rice that has a different mode of action, therefore, needs to be developed. Field tests are being conducted for the most promising high protein rice lines that were developed from the previous project. Total crude protein content and amino acid profiles will be determined for brown and milled rice. Isolation of the different fractions of seed storage proteins will also be conducted. To develop new herbicide resistant lines, different herbicides that have different modes of action than the imidazolinone herbicide will be used to screenM2 plants that are grown from the ethyl methanesulfonate treated Mo plants. Genetic studies will be conducted to determine the inheritance of the trait.World malnutrition is an undoubtedly complex problem. The availability of high protein rice varieties, it will provide a solid bottom line that can be used to help solve the worldwide malnutrition problem across social, cultural, and economic issues. High protein rice is also important to economy of Louisiana and other stated where rice is grown. New types of herbicide-resistant rice with different resistance modes will offer effective method to control weeds (including red rice) that acquire resistance to NewPath herbicide. These new herbicide-resistant lines will strengthen the weed control program and help farmers to stabilize rice yield potential.

884,"Rice is a vital grain that contributes to food security for up to one-half of the world. In Louisiana rice is an important economic commodity with total gross farm value of 371 million dollars in 2012. Louisiana rice provides employment and creates stable milling, processing, and packaging industries that make substantial contributions to the economy of our state. In spite of these successes, economic margins for Louisiana rice producers are small due to high input costs for land preparation, fertilizers, pesticides, electrical and diesel pumping for water, harvest, drying, and storage of grain, and renting of land from secondary landowners. Hybrid rice varieties can produce up to 15% more grain yield vs. inbred varieties in Louisiana and increase net return for some producers. The LSU AgCenter initiated a hybrid rice development program in 2009 to develop new germplasm with high grain yield potential coupled with grain quality suitable for both internal and export markets. Development of new hybrid germplasm will be accomplished by standard field breeding methods that also exploit culture of rice cells in the laboratory and use of DNA marker technology. The three research objectives for this Project aim to breed  foundation stocks  for hybrids adapted to Louisiana field environments, develop new hybrid combinations with viable economic potential, and create new hybrid seed production technologies adapted to U.S. conditions. Acquisition and development of new hybrid germplasm sources will be accomplished by cooperative agreements among public U.S. rice researchers and international institutes primarily in Asia and South America. Successful completion of Project goals is expected to create new hybrid germplasm that will increase grain yield, enhance grain quality over current hybrid varieties, and increase net economic return for Louisiana rice producers.

885,"There is increased interest in alternative energy sources due to increasing prices and security risks associated with fossil oils. A promising alternative energy source is biofuels made from biomass. Currently, biomass-based fuel production research is mainly focused on oil crops, sugar-based crops and cellulosic materials. Microalgae show promise as both a biofuels and bioproducts feedstock. Microalgae can produce more oil per hectare than land-based crops (Chisti, 2008; Demirbas, 2009 and 2011), have higher growth rate with a shorter harvest cycle (Schenk et al. 2008), the capability to sequester carbon dioxide and grow on low value agricultural land; therefore, not competing with agricultural crop resources. Algae 2020 report (2011) concluded that the long-term development of a biomass-based biofuels industry requires diversification of products to help revenue streams an area of increasing research interest. New algal biofuel companies have recently emerged that are producing food ingredients from the remaining algal biomass, such as Solazyme Inc., a renewable oil and bioproducts company founded in 2010. Besides the accumulation of lipids for fuels, algae produce fatty acids, pigments, and carbohydrates of key interest due to their potential health benefits and use as food ingredients (Wijffels et al., 2010). For these reasons, studies on microalgae as a source for biofuels and by-products are steadily increasing (Chisti, 2010, Mata et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2006, Andrich et al., 2006, Sawayama et al., 1999, Feinberg, 1984).The corn and soybean industries have been capitalizing on the functional characteristics of individual components for several years. Corn starch, corn oil, soy proteins and soybean oil have been utilized as food ingredients. This research has resulted in huge increases in the production and sale of these commodities as well as added value through the development of functional food ingredients. Suitable treatments for chemical modification include various potentially hazardous chemicals. These methods are generally undesirable because of safety and nutrition issues. New research can also be done to find less chemical waste and residue producing methods for manipulating the functional characteristics of starches, then those that exist now. This work would also help minimize costs associated modified starch ingredient manufacture through development of simpler methods.About 28 % of the 1.2 million tons of sweet potatoes produced annually in the U.S. are grown in the South Central region (USDA ERS 2011). In Louisiana sweet potatoes had a 2010 crop value of $80 million and value-added production value of $142 million (Smith 2011). The canning process can result in 600,000 lbs of mainly starchy waste per day, at least half of which goes directly into lagoons for digestion, creating an environmental waste issue. U.S. rice brokens range from 12% to 24% of milled rice (Sage V Foods 2012) and are sold at greatly discounted prices at 60% of the value of head rice (Siebenmorgan et al., 2012). Finding new uses for these products will add value and reduce environmental issues. The modification of corn starch to produce functional food ingredients has resulted in value-added ingredients, which has driven the selling price of native corn starch from $0.20/pound to $2.50/pound for modified corn starch-based fat replacers. There is a potential of a 10-fold increase in the value of algae by-product, rice, and sweet potato flours, from the development of starch-based fat replacers and other ingredients such as resistant starch, through utilization of the same technology.

USA is one of the top 5 rice exporting countries in the world (http://www.usarice.com/doclib/188/219/3674.PDF. The milled rice is deficient in almost all major classes of important nutrients including protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and fibers except carbohydrates. The poor nutrition, markedly the deficient of iron and zinc, of milled rice has caused severe malnutrition problems in developing countries where the access to other food is limited, particularly among children and older people.

887,"Rice is a staple crop of many cultures around the world. Traditional methods of growing rice have proven unsustainable in the face of growing water scarcity, environmental degradation, and shifting ecosystems. Flooded rice paddies are a major source of methane from anaerobic organisms. The average size of a rice farm in America is over 450 acres and growing. According to a study by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRM), rice growers in Texas used three times the amount of water as the entire city of Austin in 2012 (Henry, Terrence 2012). This research proposal designs an experiment to test sustainable models of rice production involving reduced water usage while promoting small-scale intensive practices that reduce environmental impacts. Developing methods that make growing rice an economically viable option for farmers and consumers is an important component of sustainability. Various drip irrigation and fertigation methods with biodegradable mulch to control weeds will be tested to increase rice nutrient density and profitability while maintaining the environment. Our goal is to contribute to the momentum of small-scale rice production by increasing viable options for farmers. As small scale processing equipment becomes more accessible, the capability of growing rice and other small grains, which have been the base of humanity&#39;s food security, should be in the hands of small farmers to insure a sustainable future. Our future depends on creating models of adaptability. Putting grain production into the hands of the small farmer is a step in the right direction.

888,"Rice is one of the most important field crops in the Mississippi delta and southwest Gulf coast. During the last 5 years, over 70% of the southern rice acreage was planted to Clearfield or non-Clearfield long- or medium-grain pureline varieties. Meanwhile, the hybrid rice that was first commercialized in late 1990&#39;s by RiceTec (Alvin, TX) has gained popularity due to its superior yield potential since its inception. However, current hybrid rice varieties have some shortcomings that have to be addressed for the further expansion of hybrid rice, which include high seed cost, low quality, susceptible to lodging, and seed shattering. With the increase of production costs (fuel, fertilizer, and chemicals) and stagnant crop prices, further improvement of yield and quality in long- and medium-grain rice and the development of adapted hybrid rice varieties are critical for the survival of the rice industry.The primary purpose of this project are to develop superior medium- and long-grain rice varieties with greater yield potential, better milling yield and grain quality, improved resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and earlier maturity. The other purpose is to develop improved hybrid CMS A/B and R lines that will adapted to the climatic conditions in the southern United States with an outstanding outcrossing ability and great general and specific combining ability.

Procedures for breeding and identification of hybrids, restorers and maintainers share similarities to those used for inbred line development. Breeding for and identifying both 2- and 3- line male sterile systems is more complex, but basic breeding principles still apply. Once identified, characterization of the type of CMS system or EGMS genes is needed to consistently produce hybrid seed. A large number of test crosses between potential restorers and male-sterile lines will be needed to select the best hybrid cultivar. Allocation of time to seed production will be necessary to determine which combinations produce the best hybrid seed yields.

890,"The RING finger-containing ubiquitin ligase XB3 was discovered as a protein that interacts with the rice receptor-like kinase XA21. As the first example of this type of molecules in both plant and animal immunity, XA21 controls the resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae, pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial blight disease of rice. Down-regulation of the Xb3 gene significantly destabilizes XA21 in rice and compromises XA21 resistance. XB3 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved protein family that potentially regulate programmed cell death. The ability to induce cell death has been correlated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, suggesting that ubiquitination catalyzed by XB3 is essential for its function. We propose that XB3 functions as a positive regulator of multiple physiological processes including cell death and defense.

Major insect pests include the Mexican rice borer, the sugarcane borer, wireworms, and the sugarcane aphid which is a vector of sugarcane yellow leaf disease. Pest density and yield response studies involve these insects and landscape host plant perspectives including greenhouse biomass experiments enhancing bioenergy and conventional cropping system compatibility.Pest management of sugarcane insects involves a multidisciplinary and environmentally sound holistic system which is multi-tactical, sustainable, and has proactive vision. Consistent with these goals, the stated objectives of this program are: (1) To assess the impact of resistant sugarcane varieties on the pest population dynamics of the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), and the Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), at various stages of the sugarcane breeding program; (2) to determine the temporal and spatial role of crop and non-crop hosts of the sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer, in the population dynamics of pest species; (3) to monitor range expansion, seasonal populations, and pest management of the Mexican rice borer in southwestern Louisiana; (4) consistent with EPA&#39;s concept of Best Management Practices, to evaluate new insecticidal chemistry and the impact of selected cultural and production practices on natural enemies and overwintering Mexican rice borer and sugarcane borer populations; and (5) to conduct research on management systems for new pest insects and diseases transmitted by insects.

893,"The long-term viability of agriculture as a source for food, feed fiber and fuels will depend on our ability to reconcile agricultural production with environmental integrity. And research on sustainable production systems is thus crucial to developing the knowledge base to implement required agricultural innovations. This AES project proposal will focus on exploring and developing different, innovative technologies that will lead to a comprehensive utilization of various agricultural production wastes including animal wastes with poultry litter in particular, crop residues such as rice straw, and dairy and swine manure and the production of bioproducts and bioenergy through physic-chemical and biological conversions. Anaerobic digestion will be employed to co-treat poultry litter with other liquid manure streams (such as swine and dairy) to overcome the low moisture content of poultry litter, with all the process parameters such as carbon/nitrogen ratio, pH, organic loading rate, etc., being optimized. Also, solid-state digestion will be investigated as well. Beneficial use of digested solids for mushroom production by fungi will be another part of study to determine its feasibity of applications. In addition, a complete system to treat liquid animal manure to generate biohydrogen, biomethane, and a slow release fertilizer (struvite) will be developed in this project. Using crop residues to produce fumaric acid via a two stage process (acid hydrolysis and fungal fermentation) will also be explored. The information and knowledge obtained from this project will be shared with the public through both refereed and non-refereed journal publications, extension/education events, classroom teaching, and among others. The ultimate goals of this research will be to protect the soil and water and natural resources in Arkansas by reducing the volume of wastes produced and maximizing the value-added products production and environmental benefits so the agricultural production in the State can be sustained in a long run.

894,"Salt stress imposes serious limitation to the plant growth and productivity and is considered a major threat to global food security. It is a major agronomic problem in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Development of varieties with improved salt tolerance in major field crops is an urgent need to maintain crop productivity in different parts of the world. Therefore, a thorough understanding of various salt tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level is required.Rice productivity in many parts of the world is seriously affected due to high soil salinity. Being a coastal state along the Gulf of Mexico, salinity has become a major issue for rice growers in Louisiana. Rice is an attractive model organism to study salt tolerance due to its small genome size, a well-developed transformation system, availability of numerous genomic resources including high density linkage map, and whole genome sequence. Moreover, there is abundance of genetic variation for salt tolerance in the world collection of germplasm, which can be exploited for both breeding and genetic studies.The overall goal of this project is to understand the genetic complexity of various salt tolerance mechanisms and leverage this information to accelerate the development of rice varieties with improved salt tolerance. Introgression lines of a known salt tolerant donor developed in a US cultivar background will be genotyped and phenotyped for seedling stage tolerance to identify the QTLs for salt tolerance. Candidate genes will be identified through RNA-seq analysis using the introgression lines with improved salt tolerance. Molecular markers will be developed for marker-assisted breeding of salt tolerant rice varieties via pyramiding approach. The major accomplishment of this project will be the development of a well-characterized genetic stock at both phenotypic and molecular level to aid in thorough understanding of various salt tolerance mechanisms using functional genomics tools in future.

895,"Significant changes have occurred in agricultural production over the last 10-20 years. In cotton, transgenic varieties that produce insecticidal proteins have been introduced to control caterpillar pests. As a result, the pest complex has shifted to include more true bug type insects such as the tarnished plant bug. In rice, insecticide seed treatments have been introduced to manage the rice water weevil. Little information exists about how agronomic practices may influence their efficacy. Additionally, there has been an increased demand for high quality rice on a global scale. Poor quality rice caused by rice stink bug feeding threatens current export markets and more research is needed to minimize rice stink bug damage in rice. A series of experiments will be conducted over the next four years to address these concerns. Field cage experiments will be conducted on all of these crops to quantify the damage caused by various insect pests.

897,"As an agricultural commodity, turfgrass is not food, fiber or animal feed. It impacts the lives of millions of people in many different ways, however. The turfgrass industry has grown into a multibillion dollar business worldwide, that includes $57.9 billion in business in the U.S alone in 2000. According to the last North Carolina Turfgrass survey (1999), the total acreage of tufgrass in the state neared 2.14 million acres. Over $1.22 billion was spent to maintain these areas. Single family dwellings were by far the largest single sector of the industry, with 69% of the turf area and 60% of expenditures. Regarding the types of grasses used, tall fescue accounted for over 40% of the total area of maintained turf. Centipede and Bermuda were the next two most common types with 16% and 11%, respectively. North Carolina is located in the transition zone for cool- and warm-season grasses. While this means that we can grow both types of grasses, no one type of grass does well in all weather conditions. Cool season grasses go dormant during hot, dry months and can turn brown and even die during extremely hot and dry conditions. Warm-season grasses are very drought tolerant because of their low water requirement, which makes them ideal during the summer months. However, they go dormant and turn brown during the cool days of fall and winter, and winter kill can often be a problem in the NC region.Applied plant breeding can be used to develop turfgrass cultivars that are better adapted to environmental conditions present in North Carolina. Development of cool-season grasses with increased heat and drought tolerance, and warm-season grasses with improved cold tolerance would contribute significantly to different sectors of the turfgrass industry. Genetics and applied plant breeding can also be used to improve aesthetics, performance, and disease resistance of turfgrass cultivars which, in turn, affect the efficiency of maintenance and production. The long-term goal of the program is to improve the sustainability and economic gain of the overall turfgrass industry in the state through the development of cultivars that require reduced inputs and that are capable of tolerating biotic and environmental stresses while still maintaining good quality and overall performance.Despite the fact that large amounts of genomic information have been generated for other grasses such as rice, maize, and wheat, turfgrass species have lagged far behind.

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is an economically important vegetable crop and rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the stable food crop to feed more than 50% of the world&#39;s population. However, both tomato and rice plants are very cold-sensitive. Spring frosts restrict planting season of tomato while fall frosts and freezing temperatures can cause substantial reduction to tomato yield. Cold conditions cause an average annual yield reduction of 5-10%, but unpredictable cold snaps occurring on average every 3-4years can result in yield losses of 20-40% in all temperate rice growing areas of the world. We recently have identified a cold-inducible DEAD box RNA helicase, RCF1, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing and is important for cold-responsive gene regulation and cold tolerance in plants. Overexpression of RCF1 in Arabidopsis thaliana significantly improved chilling and freezing tolerance. We hypothesize that mechanisms of RCF1 or its closest rice homologs function under cold stress are conserved and overproduction of RCF1 tomato and rice plants or its closest rice homologs in rice improve performance of these two cold-sensitive crops. In this project, we will first determine role of rice homologs of RCF1 in cold stress and then produce transgenic tomato and rice plants overexpressing RCF1 and/or rice homologs of RCF1. We will evaluate cold tolerance of transgenic tomato and rice plants under both lab environments and field conditions.

899,"Abiotic and biotic stresses are the major factors limiting growth and productivity of field crops. For example, injury due to use of non-selective herbicides and stripe rust in wheat, drought in rice, and aflatoxin contamination in cotton are problems of global conerns. Development of stress-resilient varieties is the most cost-effective and environment friendly approach to managing these stresses. Conventional breeding has been successful in many crops in development of varieties that are tolerant/resistant to different stresses. Howver, conventional breeding takes time and the progress has been slow because of the quantitative inhertance of stress tolerance traits. Moreover, the unavailability of resistant donor (e.g., cotton against Aspergillus flavus) in the available germplasm is limitation to plant breeding where transgenic approach is the only alternative. By using latest tools of gene expression and genome mapping, the present proposal is evisioned to accomplish a common goal of identifying genes and subsequent development of gene-based functional markers that will facilitate marker-assisted breeding for metribuzin and stripe rust resistance in wheat, drought tolerance in rice, and genetic engineering for A. flvus resistance in cotton.

900,"The goal of the proposed research is to improve the process of developing superior performing plant phenotypes and increase understanding of how crops respond to abiotic and biotic stresses. Most of the research discussed herein is applicable to a very wide range of cropping systems.Currently, most plant breeders use a mixture of intuition and science to develop improved cultivars. Each breeder creates and eliminates thousands of lines every year, keeping those lines or hybrids that appear to offer a significant yield increase while matching the breeder&#39;s view of what connotes an optimal plant ideotype, and discarding those that do not. Selection for further evaluation or elimination is based on an extremely limited amount of data during the early stages of selection. A line can be misclassified as superior or inferior yielding due to non-uniform variation in planting depth, availability soil-nutrients, and biotic stresses across the research plots. It is only during the later stages of selection that plot size becomes sufficiently large to begin to minimize the likelihood of misclassification. This problem highlights the value of being able to accurately estimate growth, development, and yield potential based on early season measurements of plant traits that are stable across a wide range of conditions.Our research has led to the development of a physiologically based rice crop simulation model to define the  best  combination of plant traits to achieve increased grain yield for a given set of environmental conditions. Both field data and simulation results suggest rice yield can be increased by selecting genotypes having traits that increase early season vegetative growth. Interestingly, all of the primary phenotypic traits identified as being required to produce a superior yielding inbred cultivar are also found in the new slate of hybrids that have recently been commercialized for the U.S. rice production market. This convergence of what might be called a high yielding rice plant ideotype is encouraging and suggests the underlying basis for superior yield performance can be obtained, at least in part, using the same selection criteria for both inbreds and hybrids.A major aspect of the proposed research will focus on determining whether hybrid vigor is demand- or supply-driven. If hybrid vigor is demand-driven then this would imply that the major increase in yield that is often observed with hybrid rice can be achieved with inbred rice. However, if hybrid vigor is caused by fundamental differences in how photosynthesis is determined by ?C, nitrogen (&#39;N&#39;), CO2, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) light response, and sugar/carbohydrate feedback inhibition, then this would suggest that only a fraction of the increased vigor found in hybrids can be readily transferrable to inbreds. An important aspect of the research will be to identify which primary phenotypic traits in hybrids can be predicted based on traits values of the inbred parents. The greater the number of traits that can be predicted, the greater will be our ability to accurately predict which traits to combine in a hybrid to increase yield.Crop yield performance is also determined by the presence of biotic stresses. The degree that plant characteristics influence the impact of biotic stresses on crop growth and yield is important when evaluating cultivar performance. Cultivars that have similar yields in the absence of biotic stress, such as insect feeding injury, can have strikingly different yields in their presence. The response of different rice phenotypes to stem borer insect feeding injury will be examined as part of the proposed research. base; Carbohydrates; Carbon Dioxide; Cereals; Characteristics; Data; Development; Evaluation; Feedback; feeding; Genotype; Goals; Growth; Growth and Development function; Hybrid Vigor; Hybrids; improved; Inbreeding; Inferior; Injury; Insecta; Intuition; Light; Marketing; Measurement; models and simulation; Nitrogen; Nutrient; Parents; Performance; Phenotype; Photosynthesis; Plants; Process; Production; Radiation; Research; response; Rice; Science; Seasons; Selection Criteria; simulation; Soil; Staging; stem; Stress; sugar; System; trait; VariantTHE EFFECT OF HETEROSIS ON PRIMARY PHENOTYPIC TRAITS AND ITS DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACT ON CROP YIELD",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,0.0001939446393827145,0.999999
901,"Objective(s): 1. In collaboration with international teams of plant breeders, we will develop lines of staple food crops such as beans, pearl millet, sorghum, rice, lentils and maize with improved Fe and Zn content and bioavailability.  1.A.  Identify molecular markers and ultimately the genes that influence iron level and bioavailability in maize seed.  Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and an in-vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell culture model system will be used for this research sub-objective.    1.B.  Identify molecular markers and ultimately the genes that influence iron level and bioavailability in lentils.  Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and an in-vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell culture model system will be used for this research sub-objective.      1.C.  Identify agricultural and processing practices that enhance the nutritional quality of Fe in staple food crops.  1.D.  Continue our work to identify compounds that promote or inhibit Fe bioavailability in staple food crops.   2.  Evaluate a surgical duodenal loop model in poultry as a tool to measure bioavailability of health promoting phytochemicals.   2.A. Determine if absorption of selected phytochemicals can be measured in the poultry duodenal loop model.  2.B. Define bioavailability of specific phytochemicals from select foods using the validated duodenal loop model.  Approach: This project has two major objectives.  The first is to develop lines of staple food crops with improved bioavailability and content of iron (Fe).  To do so we will employ our established screening tools of an iron bioavailability bioassay and an animal model.  In conjunction with these tools, we will make use of mass spectroscopy and marker assisted molecular breeding techniques.  With these approaches, we will be able to identify and utilize regions of the plant genome that harbor genes associated with the enhanced food crop nutritional quality for Fe. To further complement the above approaches, we will continue our work on the identification of agricultural and food processing practices that enhance the bioavailability and content of Fe and Zn in staple food crops.   The second major objective of this project is to develop a method to measure and evaluate the bioavailability of functional phytochemicals from plant foods.  To do so, we will assess the use of a surgical model utilizing the unique intestinal anatomy of the broiler chicken to measure absorption of compounds from the duodenal segment of the intestine.  This approach uses an established surgical preparation involving anesthetized animals.  Our initial efforts with this model will focus on compounds that are common to many staple food crops, fruits and vegetables.  These phytochemicals will include the flavonoids epicatechin, quercitin, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and kaempferol. Enhancing our knowledge of bioavailability of health promoting phytochemicals will significantly improve efforts to develop more nutritious plant foods. absorption; Agriculture; Anatomy; Animal Model; Animals; bean; Biological Assay; Biological Availability; Biological Models; Caco-2 Cells; Caffeic Acids; Cell Culture Techniques; Chickens; Chlorogenic Acid; Collaborations; Complement; Digestion; DNA Shuffling; Domestic Fowls; Edible Plants; epicatechin; Flavonoids; Food; Food Processing; fruits and vegetables; Genes; Health; improved; In Vitro; International; Intestines; Iron; kaempferol; Knowledge; Lentils - dietary; Maize; Maps; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measures; Methods; Modeling; molecular marker; Nutritional; Operative Surgical Procedures; Pennisetum; Phytochemical; Plant Genome; Plants; Preparation; Process; Quantitative Trait Loci; Research; Rice; screening; Seeds; Sorghum; Surgical Models; Techniques; tool; Work; ZincBIOAVAILABILITY OF IRON, ZINC AND SELECT PHYTOCHEMICALS FOR IMPROVED HEALTH",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06

903,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Health Economics Program in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Boston University School of Public Health seeks funding to support continuation of the highly successful Annual Health Economics Conferences (AHEC) for 2013 (at the University of Pennsylvania), 2014 (at Rice University) and 2015 (at the University of Georgia). The AHEC conference uses a small conference format for rigorous presentation and discussion of health economics research, with special attention to its application to policy. In this context, the aims of these conferences are: (1) to advance the polic applicability of health economics by exploring theoretical issues with high potential for application to real-world health settings; (2) to improve the policy relevance of empirical health economics by fostering research that emphasizes the study of important current policy questions using rigorous methods; and (3) to develop the next generation of health economic scholars by placing promising junior economists with high-profile senior economists in an intensive 1.5-day, small group setting. Over the past 23 years, AHEC has been hosted by most of the major universities that offer advanced degree programs and have major funded research programs in health economics. The unique nature of each conference focus combined with the prestige of each university has ensured exceptionally high quality papers and serious interactions among conference participants. For these three years, the conference will build upon past success by (1) retaining the core structure and tradition of AHEC, with extensive discussion of leading-edge, policy-relevant research in health economics and (2) addressing the current changing health care reform environment by including sessions that focus on two critical issues in the cost, productivity, organization, and market forces of health care that are of curren importance for public policy and AHRQ.

905,"The solutions to many of the outstanding problems in geology, environmental science, material science, and biology require understanding the chemical state and detailed atomic structure of the molecules and solids that make up our world.  Such problems range from understanding the molecular forms of arsenic in rice, determining the chemical composition of the earths interior, and improving the performance and reducing the environmental impact of batteries that are in our laptops, cellphones, and cars.  The nation's synchrotron facilities provide powerful X-ray facilities that allow researchers to study these questions by investigating the chemical makeup and crystal structure of complex, real-world materials such as plant seeds, contaminated soils, human and animal tissue, minerals and meteorites, and working batteries and catalysts.  Synchrotron measurement techniques have developed very rapidly over the past few decades, and are being used by many more researchers.  The ability to handle and interpret the large and complex datasets now being routinely generated at these facilities is often a significant challenge, even for experts.  The work here will develop the Larch X-ray analysis framework to provide open-source software that is easy to use and specific enough to correctly interpret several categories of synchrotron X-ray data.  The approach will provide tools that are flexible enough to enable researchers to explore and interpret new combinations of data easily enough to make new connections and discoveries in a wide variety of scientific areas.   This project will integrate visualization and analysis software for multiple synchrotron X-ray techniques into the open source and extensible Larch X-ray Analysis framework.  The immediate focus of the work is to support visualization and quantitative analysis of the rich and complex data from X-ray microprobes, including X-ray fluorescence imaging, fluorescence and absorption spectroscopies, and X-ray diffraction.  The Larch framework already provides a suite of analysis procedures for X-ray absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging, and has been designed to be readily extensible by adding plug-ins in Python, widely used in scientific computing and being embraced in the synchrotron user communities.  Existing state-of-the-art analysis procedures for X-ray fluorescence, X-ray absorption, and X-ray diffraction have been identified to be integrated into the Larch framework, adapting and translating the software as needed to be compatible with the open-source Python framework.  With the combination of state-of-the-art analysis methods for multiple data types, Larch will provide a single well-supported and -documented analysis package with robust, easy to use analytic methods for a range of synchrotron X-ray data. By being easily extensible, the Larch package can also accommodate methods for other synchrotron X-ray techniques. absorption; animal tissue; Area; Arsenic; Arts; Biology; catalyst; Categories; Chemicals; Communities; Complex; Computer software; Data; Data Set; design; Ecology; Environmental Impact; flexibility; Fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; Geology; Human; Imagery; improved; laptop; Larix; Measurement; Meteorite; Methods; Minerals; Molecular; open source; Performance; Plants; Procedures; Pythons; Research Personnel; Rice; Roentgen Rays; Science; scientific computing; Seeds; Soil; Solid; Solutions; Spectrum Analysis; Structure; Synchrotrons; Techniques; tool; Translating; Work; X ray diffraction analysis; X-Ray DiffractionSI2-SSI INTEGRATION OF SYNCHROTRON X-RAY ANALYSIS SOFTWARE METHODS INTO THE LARCH FRAMEWORK",0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06
906,"PI: Jacot, Jeffrey     Proposal Number: 1547838  Heart failure is the major cause of death in the U.S., and heart defects are the major cause of death in infants. This project will design, build and validate a device that can be used at a hospital to create living heart tissue for repair of failing hearts and heart defects. Clinicians would inject a patient's own cells into the device, which would then automatically control the release of chemicals required to make living heart muscle. In about 2 weeks, surgeons would open the device, remove the heart muscle, and use it to restructure a failing or malformed heart. This technology could transform the clinical approach to heart disease and heart defects, and could produce the first regenerative cure for these conditions.  The implementation of novel and transformative therapies using cardiac tissue derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) requires the development of new technologies that can efficiently create heart tissue from pluripotent stem cells and ensure elimination of tumorigenic undifferentiated cells without laboratory intervention or extensive processing. This can be accomplished with a closed bioreactor system to create engineered cardiac tissue from iPSC. The intellectual merit of this proposal is based on the hypothesis that a bioreactor containing a pump, heart matrix-based hydrogel, and nanoparticles controlling the timed release of differentiation factors can create a 3-D contractile cardiac tissue with organization and function similar to native tissue. To test this hypothesis, a closed-system bioreactor that pumps media through cardiac matrix hydrogels along with silica nanoparticles that release cardiac differentiation factors will be constructed and tested with human iPSC. The release of factors shown to eliminate pluripotent cells will purify the tissue and prevent the implantation of tumorigenic cells and this will be verified through PCR and immunostaining. Finally, tissues with suturable scaffolds will be generated and implanted into a rat model of cardiac defect repair. The broader educational and social impacts of this proposal are integrated with the intellectual merit and include outreach activities with several Houston high schools though the Rice K-12 Initiative to bring increased awareness of biotechnology, biomaterials and stem cells among high school students and increased participation of high school students in science & engineering. 3-Dimensional; Awareness; base; Biocompatible Materials; Biomanufacturing; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Cardiac; Cause of Death; Cell Differentiation process; Cells; Chemicals; Clinical; Congenital Heart Defects; controlled release; design; Development; Devices; Engineering; Ensure; Heart; Heart Diseases; Heart failure; high school; High School Student; Hospitals; Human; Hydrogels; Implant; implantation; induced pluripotent stem cell; Infant; Intervention; Laboratories; Life; Modeling; Myocardium; nanoparticle; new technology; novel; outreach; Patients; Pluripotent Stem Cells; prevent; Process; Pump; Rattus; regenerative; release factor; repaired; Rice; scaffold; Science; Silicon Dioxide; Social Impacts; Stem cells; Surgeon; System; Technology; Testing; Time; Tissue Engineering; tissue repair; Tissues; tumorigenic; UndifferentiatedEAGER: BIOMANUFACTURING: CELL DIFFERENTIATION BIOREACTOR FOR CARDIAC TISSUE ENGINEERING",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,3.1772492113336447e-06,1e-06

These students now can participate in a global community that can help deal with the many complex issues involved in conducting research in such a new and inherently multidisciplinary field. These issues range from proper training, to gaining a broad perspective, to accessing technical expertise that may not be available at their home institution. In addition to the obvious broader impacts related to training of a research workforce, there are other broad impacts of this plan. Via the interaction of one of the PoLS nodes (Rice) with the biomedical community in Houston, students and faculty will be exposed to possible avenues whereby physics can contribute to human health issues. Funds to attract  students from under-represented groups to network meetings will be available through the new funds administered by the newly proposed network coordinator.

There is by now little disagreement with the general notion that concepts and methods from physics have been a critical contributor to the increased understanding of the living world, and that its importance will be growing as the scientific world moves toward an ever more quantitative and predictive form of biology. Thus, the physics community clearly needs to train a new generation of scientists who can lead this effort, scientists who have the right mix of physics/mathematics rigor and broad knowledge of living systems from molecular scales on up. The PoLS SRN aims at creating a community of graduate students who can collectively help themselves and their mentors accelerate and enhance this training process. This is being done by a mix of in-person and virtual modes of communication, and this proposal is a plan to continue and expand these efforts; it will reach more students, improve the social networking portals, and make use of the complementary research agendas of the different network nodes to provide broad technical expertise.

This research project is making contributions to the field in the areas of STEM workforce development and broadening participation in STEM.  The proposed work is advancing basic understanding about the intersectional mechanisms of disadvantage, at the interpersonal, organizational and professional levels, for underrepresented groups in STEM.  There is a pressing need to ensure that a diverse STEM workforce is engaged to advance our nation's progress in science, engineering and education, to address national societal needs through STEM research and education, and to contribute to the 21st century U.S. workforce.  By better understanding the professional, workplace and interactional variables that contribute to mechanisms of disadvantage, marginalization and underrepresentation of STEM professionals, our nation can better address barriers to success, can more strongly facilitate the integration of STEM education and research, and can enhance our engagement of a diverse 21st century workforce.    Project leaders at Rice University and Temple University are collaborating to collect survey and interview data from STEM professionals about social and cultural variables found at the interpersonal, organizational and professional levels that produce disadvantage and marginalization in the workplace.  They are examining demographic variables, such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexuality, and disability, and the researchers are conducting numerous measures of workplace policies and practices, of interactional climates on the job, and of professional cultures.  The data is being used by the researchers to better understand the interactions among these data to advance knowledge about disadvantage for underrepresented STEM professionals in the U.S.  At the completion of this exploratory study, it is anticipated that results will inform future basic and applied broadening participation in STEM research about our nation's underrepresented STEM workforce. The results of this work are expected to be shared with education and STEM researchers in professional publications and shared with STEM professional organizations, employers and the public in study briefings.

The proposed work is advancing basic understanding about the intersectional mechanisms of disadvantage, at the interpersonal, organizational and professional levels, for underrepresented groups in STEM.  There is a pressing need to ensure that a diverse STEM workforce is engaged to advance our nation's progress in science, engineering and education, to address national societal needs through STEM research and education, and to contribute to the 21st century U.S. workforce.  By better understanding the professional, workplace and interactional variables that contribute to mechanisms of disadvantage, marginalization and underrepresentation of STEM professionals, our nation can better address barriers to success, can more strongly facilitate the integration of STEM education and research, and can enhance our engagement of a diverse 21st century workforce.    Project leaders at Rice University and Temple University are collaborating to collect survey and interview data from STEM professionals about social and cultural variables found at the interpersonal, organizational and professional levels that produce disadvantage and marginalization in the workplace.  They are examining demographic variables, such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexuality, and disability, and the researchers are conducting numerous measures of workplace policies and practices, of interactional climates on the job, and of professional cultures.  The data is being used by the researchers to better understand the interactions among these data to advance knowledge about disadvantage for underrepresented STEM professionals in the U.S.  At the completion of this exploratory study, it is anticipated that results will inform future basic and applied broadening participation in STEM research about our nation's underrepresented STEM workforce. The results of this work are expected to be shared with education and STEM researchers in professional publications and shared with STEM professional organizations, employers and the public in study briefings.

911,"During space storms, electric fields and particle precipitation expand into mid-latitudes equatorward of the auroral oval. Electric fields, produced by the interaction of the magnetosphere with the onrushing solar wind ultimately are responsible for the auroral oval but they also cause high-energy electrons and ions to drift deep into the inner magnetosphere.  The inner magnetosphere maps along magnetic field lines into the midlatitude ionosphere causing disturbances there.  On the dusk side of the inner magnetosphere, the ions penetrate closer to the Earth (and thus to lower latitudes) than the electrons. The weak magnetic field-aligned currents associated with ion pressure gradients at high altitude in space surrounding the Earth close through the low-density sub-auroral ionosphere on the dusk side and in the process produce strong westward electric fields that set the subauroral ionospheric plasma in motion.  The electric fields and the drifts they produce in the ionosphere are called subauroral polarization streams (SAPS).  The resulting strong ionospheric electric fields map back out along magnetic field lines producing effects in the magnetosphere.  This coupling is important in producing space weather disturbances. The proposal will develop an empirical model based on a suite of low-earth orbiting satellites that describes the global distribution of SAPS fields in the ionosphere as a function of solar and geophysical conditions.  An important aspect of this work is an investigation of the feedback between the electrical conductance of the ionosphere and the SAPS evolution.  The results will contribute to our ability to understand and predict the temporal evolution of space weather disturbances and their impacts on vulnerable technologies.  Of particular importance, SAPS draw dense plasma from the dayside ionosphere in plumes up over the polar cap, which can disrupt GPS signals resulting in large errors in global positioning.  A graduate student will be trained on the project at the University of Texas.  The proposers will use 80 years of ionospheric observations covering different local time sectors taken by satellites in the Defense Meteorological Satellite, Dynamics Explorer, and Atmosphere Explorer Programs.  These will be sorted by solar activity and geophysical parameters to construct the first empirical model of subauroral electric fields.   The data will also be used in a superposed epoch analysis of magnetic storms to understand the evolution of the SAPS electric fields during different stages of the storm.   The RCM-E model, which combines the Rice Convection Model (RCM) with an equilibrium (self-consistent) magnetic field model (E), is a physics-based model that will be used to explore the evolution of the SAPS and test how ionospheric conductance affects this evolution. Given the plasma distribution for each species along with the magnetic field and electric potential at the outer boundary of the inner magnetosphere at high altitude, and the electric conductance pattern in the ionosphere, RCM solves for the electrodynamics of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. An important new aspect of this work is the focus on the effects of ion-neutral coupling through the changes it produces in the imposed ionospheric conductance pattern (i.e., progressive decrease in subauroral density as the storm progresses).

912,"This collaborative research project, consisting of four institutions (Rice, Yale, UIUC and Princeton) aims to continue the Physics of Living Systems Student Research Network (PoLS SRN). This network has been in existence for four years and has had a dramatic impact on many graduate students, both in the US and abroad, working on the application of physical science techniques to living systems. These students now can participate in a global community that can help deal with the many complex issues involved in conducting research in such a new and inherently multidisciplinary field. These issues range from proper training, to gaining a broad perspective, to accessing technical expertise that may not be available at their home institution. In addition to the obvious broader impacts related to training of a research workforce, there are other broad impacts of this plan. Via the interaction of one of the PoLS nodes (Rice) with the biomedical community in Houston, students and faculty will be exposed to possible avenues whereby physics can contribute to human health issues. Funds to attract  students from under-represented groups to network meetings will be available through the new funds administered by the newly proposed network coordinator. Also deas vetted by the PoLS SRN will be adapted to create student networks in other areas of science and engineering.  There is by now little disagreement with the general notion that concepts and methods from physics have been a critical contributor to the increased understanding of the living world, and that its importance will be growing as the scientific world moves toward an ever more quantitative and predictive form of biology. Thus, the physics community clearly needs to train a new generation of scientists who can lead this effort, scientists who have the right mix of physics/mathematics rigor and broad knowledge of living systems from molecular scales on up. The PoLS SRN aims at creating a community of graduate students who can collectively help themselves and their mentors accelerate and enhance this training process. This is being done by a mix of in-person and virtual modes of communication, and this proposal is a plan to continue and expand these efforts; it will reach more students, improve the social networking portals, and make use of the complementary research agendas of the different network nodes to provide broad technical expertise. Doing all of this, will boost the intellectual level of the entire research field and convince the best students that the Physics of Living Systems is truly the most exciting research frontier in 21st century science.

915,"Flowering plants exhibit two major growth strategies. One (called the dicot strategy) is for the growing tip of the plant to climb upward by producing an elongating stem below it. The alternative strategy (termed the monocot strategy) is for the growing tip to stay protected at the base of the plant and produce a series of leaves that rise above the plant and then grow around it. This latter monocot strategy has the advantage of protecting the growing tip at the base of the plant for much of its life. It enables grasses to survive extensive grazing, and it is the growth strategy that is used by plants like wheat, maize and rice. Despite its use by plants of ecological and agricultural importance, this monocot strategy is not well understood. In this project, a collaborative team of US (University of California, Berkeley) and UK (John Innes Centre) investigators  will use a combination of tools including high resolution imaging and computational methods to test mechanisms that will develop predictive and testable models. These models will describe the processes of growth and shape changes in the monocot leaf. Because the position of the leaf blade has an effect on the amount of light a plant can harvest for photosynthesis, this work could significantly impact crop yield. Biotech industries will benefit from the work, through greater fundamental understanding of processes involved in tissue development. The investigators will be actively engaged in education at all levels, including K-12 and public education, through the development of hands on training activities, YouTube videos, and more traditional methods of diffusion of research findings.   Computational modeling has led to preliminary hypotheses of monocot leaf development. A key idea is that growth is oriented by a polarity field, which is analogous to the way a magnetic field can be used to orient directions of navigation. The observed growth and shape changes of the monocot leaf can then be explained by simple changes in the polarity field and the pattern of growth rates it orients. The aim of this project is to test and further build upon this model and determine whether the polarity fields and the growth rates the model predicts are correct using the maize monocot system (which has the advantage of well-developed genetics and associated technologies.) By looking at markers that highlight the presumed polarity fields and by determining the growth rates in different regions of the leaf, predictions of the model can be tested. Models will also be tested by analyzing mutants in which key transitions of development are disrupted. These studies will be made quantitative by writing computer programs that automatically extract the relevant measures. New computational methods will also be developed and applied to this system so that the processes can be understood at different levels, i.e. from cellular to tissue scale.

916,"Biomolecular simulation is rapidly growing in popularity and scope of application. It is no longer the preserve of a few specialist groups but is widespread - part of the ?toolkit? used by researchers in a wide variety of fields, often closely integrated with other experimental research techniques. As the use of biomolecular simulation grows, a corresponding boom in software development is taking place. Giving researchers the right tools and training to develop such software will reduce the amount of ?wheel-reinvention?, consequently improve research productivity, and make research more cost-effective.  An important question that arises however, is how do we judge the effectiveness of the tools and training used? This grant will help develop answers to such questions in the context of CECAM Extended Software Development workshop on biomolecular simulations, that will be held in Juelich, Germany on October 12-25 2015. This workshop will provide hands-on tutorials incorporating active learning approaches. The workshop will advance the way interdisciplinary computational science training is conducted as well as how tools to support computational science are developed. This grant will also support the participation of up to twelve US-based scientists to attend this workshop and contribute to achieving workshop objectives.  The impact of this workshop will be significant in three directions: It will (i) provide support for US junior and early career scientists to learn a plethora of new tools and techniques central to their science, (ii) lead to an improvement to the ?tools? being developed as well as the methodology by which the effectiveness of tools is assessed, and (iii) move towards a method of data-driven and dynamic organization of workshops. This provides a natural evolution in the sophistication of simple ?hackathons?. It will provide a template for how future multidisciplinary hands-on workshops training can be organized.  Lessons learned from this workshop will be used as a basis to improve future computational science classes at Rutgers, Rice and elsewhere. The workshop participants will be selected in order to have a broad representation of the communities we want to engage. The PIs will have a special outreach activity to early career scientists (newly established faculty and post-doctoral researchers) as well as graduate students, and will encourage the participation of minorities and women.  This workshop will (i) improve the ability of non-computing specialist scientists to utilize existing tools and software better, but also help formulate their needs and requirements better, (ii) enable tool-smiths to answer a critical and recurring question, viz., how to separate the impact and suitability of tools from the effectiveness of the techniques used to teach and train?, (iii) develop exercises that will not only improve scientific productivity but also enable domain scientists to understand how to employ tools that reach adequate scales seamlessly from their local environments to remote resources, (iv) propose an agenda and a set of exercises that will be adaptive based upon real-time feedback and assessment, and serve as a template that can be generalized and instantiated to other domains.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Brook Moyers is  Using genotype and environment to predict water use physiology in rice.   The host institution for the fellowship is the Colorado State University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. John McKay.  Rice is a water-intensive crop and the primary calorie source for many developing countries. As global demand for water increases, so will the need for rice varieties that require less water to grow. This project will model the interaction of genotype and environment to predict water use in rice, providing vital information to breeders and potentially contributing to the development of new drought-tolerant rice varieties. The project is in collaboration with researchers at the International Rice Research Institute and includes training in applied agricultural research. A diverse group of undergraduate researchers will participate in the project and will be trained as the next generation of plant breeders. Together, the proposed activities will provide the basis for an independent research program that uses fundamental research to address global needs.  This project will tackle the  grand challenge  of predicting phenotype from genotype in specific environments by building and validating a physiological model that incorporates genotype effects. The two major objectives are (1) to use high-throughput phenotyping data from a new, highly recombinant rice population (Global MAGIC) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying water use physiology in two soil moisture environments, and (2) to use these QTL as parameters in a model of water use physiology. The model will be validated by predicting phenotypes that are produced by the novel genotypes grown in specific environments. Evaluating the model will provide insight into the interactions among alleles and environmental factors affecting water use physiology in plants. All of the project data will be available to the public via the Dryad Digital Data Repository, and the Global MAGIC population is freely available to rice breeding programs through the International Rice Research Institute.

918,"The northern South American countries of Colombia and Venezuela have high seismic hazard. These countries are subject to frequent large earthquakes along strike-slip fault systems and subduction zones with the same combined seismic hazard potential as California's  San Andreas system, and Oregon, Washington, and Alaska's subduction zones.  Recent space geodesy measurements suggest that northwestern South America is overdue for a great (M>8) earthquake along the flat Caribbean subduction zone under northern Colombia and the Lake Maracaibo region.  Although both countries have modern earthquake monitoring and seismic hazard assessment agencies, Fundaci¿n Venezolana de Investigaciones Sismol¿gicas (FUNVISIS) and Servico Geol¿gico Colombiano (SGC), seismic hazard in both nations is exacerbated by poor, unregulated construction practices and a growing population of urban poor. The two nations have a combined population of ~80 million, and rapidly growing urban populations. Both the Venezuelan and Colombian civil and petroleum infrastructures are at risk from large seismic events.    For a variety of reasons, including proximity, both Venezuela and Colombia are of strategic significance to the U.S. [Miami and New Orleans are closer to Bogota and Caracas than they are to Seattle, for instance].  Venezuela is of international importance, with hydrocarbon reserves that exceed Saudi Arabia's and extensive hydrocarbon production facilities. Venezuela currently supplies the U.S. with ~ 8% of its oil imports, only slightly less than imports from Saudi Arabia.  The U.S. is Venezuela's most important trading partner. Scientific exchange between the U.S. and Venezuela and Colombia is important for developing scientific capacity in these nations, and for training their earth science workforces. Over the course of its history, the Rice Earth Science department has continuously enrolled M.Sc. and Ph.D. students from Venezuela and Colombia.   Roughly 10% of modern subduction zones exhibit flat slab segments, including 3-4 along western South American (SA). Geologic history suggests ~70% of the western SA margin experienced flat subduction in the Cenozoic. Slab flattening is attributed to slab buoyancy, mantle wedge properties, and mantle flow dynamics. Flat subduction causes deformation in the overriding plate substantially different than that caused by normal subduction, as seen in seismicity, type and distribution of magmatism, and in some cases, basement cored uplifts. It is now recognized that the Caribbean subducts at low angles under  northwestern SA, forming the basement cored uplifts of the Santa Marta, Perija, and Merida Andes ranges.  These may be modern analogs to the late Mesozoic-early Cenozoic Laramide basement uplifts of the western United States. With FUNVISIS and SGC, the investigator team will install a large broadband seismograph array to image the subduction zone geometry and measure plate coupling rheology of the northern SA flat slab, with a goal of understanding the geodynamic development of basement uplifts.  The local and regional earthquakes recorded by their seismograph array will be used for seismic hazard assessment in northern South America.

919,"With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Junrong Zheng of Rice University to elucidate details of the C-H activation mechanism catalyzed by Fe-containing organic molecules, by studying signatures of the reaction intermediates.  The structures of key intermediates are being investigated by a broadband multiple-dimensional multiple-mode vibrational spectroscopy method being developed for these purposes in the Zheng group. An outreach program developed by Professor Zheng is allowing local high school students the opportunity to participate in this research and that projects associated with fundamental molecular events underneath daily phenomena are being designed for high school students to inspire their interest in fundamental physical sciences. Graduate and undergraduate students are being actively mentored and involved in all aspects of the research and education plan. Animated cartoons will be developed to demonstrate basic chemical and physical principles for kids.  This project focuses on the structural determinations of the intermediate oxidants of the nonheme catalyst Fe(S,S-PDP), resolving the disagreement about its C-H activation mechanism. The intermediates can be paramagnetic and transient in liquids and difficult to be resolved by traditional techniques. To meet the challenge, novel ultrafast vibrational spectroscopic methods are being developed to resolve the in situ structures of these transient species with an ultrafast temporal resolution.   Organic syntheses of various reagents and catalysts and theoretical calculations are being conducted to reach a comprehensive understanding of the reactions.  The broader impacts of this work include bringing a deeper understanding of many C-H activation reactions catalyzed by heme and nonheme molecules, and developing a novel method that can resolve many molecular structures in both inorganic and organic chemistry that are difficult for traditional techniques.

920,"This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Nowlan Freese is  Regulation of stress response in salt-stressed rice through the modulation of alternative splicing by methylation.  The host institution for the fellowship is the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Ann Loraine.   A fifth of the world's daily calories come from rice. Changing environmental conditions can impact agricultural production significantly, and so it is particularly important to understand how rice plants respond and adapt to stress conditions. This project investigates how rice genomes respond to salt stress through changes in the DNA that alter the way gene information is passed on. The process, called  alternative splicing,  alters parts of genes resulting in differences in gene products. This project will identify the molecular mechanisms that drive alternative splicing during salt stress, providing the foundational information for researchers to explore new frontiers in genomics and for breeders to develop salt tolerant varieties of rice in the future. The Fellow will be trained in bioinformatics, statistical data analysis, and methods in plant molecular biology. This project also provides information and research experience to high school students to facilitate understanding of basic science concepts in the relevant context of environmental change.   In plants, exposure to abiotic stress triggers genome-wide changes in splicing patterns, enriching for stress-specific transcript isoforms. However, the mechanism through which stress pathways regulate splicing remains largely unknown. In rice, salt and other abiotic stresses alter DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that can enhance stress tolerance. Evidence from animal systems suggests that DNA methylation within genes influences co-transcriptional splicing by defining intron/exon boundaries. This project will determine if a similar link exists in plants by investigating the connection between DNA methylation, alternative splicing, and stress response in salt-stressed rice.

921,"Many microbes cause serious diseases of plants, humans and other animals. Both plants and animals possess immune systems that serve to recognize the presence of foreign organisms, which then leads to the initiation of defense responses that prevent further spread of the invading microbe. Recognition usually occurs when the host senses foreign proteins that are either secreted by the microbe as it attempts to establish the pathogenic state, or which form part of the organism's  coat.   Unfortunately, pathogens have developed mechanisms that subvert the host's defenses, allowing them to grow and cause disease. For example, it is well known that the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes a devastating disease of rice known as blast, can avoid recognition by the plant through the mutation or loss of genes that code for proteins that would normally bind to specific resistance receptors in the rice plant. Recent studies in the investigator's laboratory imply the existence of a novel mechanism by which rice blast, and probably other pathogenic microbes, may escape host recognition. The hypothesized mechanism involves a bet hedging strategy in which genetically identical fungal colonies vary the types of proteins they secrete, thereby evading recognition by the host immune system. This project seeks direct evidence that this mechanism is employed during an infection.  Any given M. oryzae strain has the potential to secrete hundreds of proteins during the infection process, many of which could elicit a defense reaction. However, current data suggest that the fungus bet-hedges against recognition by expressing different secreted protein subsets in fungal colonies that are genetically identical to one another. Such clonal variation in gene expression is believed to be a risk-spreading strategy that increases the chance of infection success on unpredictable plant genotypes. The goal of this project is to test this hypothesis and thereby improve understanding of the recognition processes between pathogens and their hosts. The specific objectives of the planned research are to: 1) Use RNAseq of individual infection sites to test for variable expression of fungal genes whose products elicit resistance in rice; 2) Use differential RNAseq to establish a causal link between mesothetic host reactions and the variable expression of one or more fungal avirulence genes. The central hypothesis is transformative because it establishes a new paradigm for plant-microbe recognition, with the potential to revolutionize current thinking in the field. The knowledge generated in the project could alter how plants are bred for disease resistance and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for microbial diseases of human and other animals. The project will provide research training for an existing graduate student, who will also attend a Next Generation Sequencing and Bioinformatics workshop during the term of the project. These training opportunities will greatly expand her skill set and thereby enhance future career prospects.

922,"Most plants are hermaphrodites, which means that they carry both male and female organs. Some, like tomato, rice, beans and other cultivated species, cast pollen from male to female organs in the same flower. Others employ ingenious schemes to ensure that one individual pollinates the flower of another. Persimmon, pistachio, kiwi, hops, and spinach are amongst the few percent of plant species in which these functions are found in separate individuals, a condition called dioecy. In mammals maleness or femaleness are determined by X and Y chromosomes: males have an X and a Y and females have two Xs. A single gene on the Y is responsible for triggering the development of male traits. Most dioecious plants resemble the human system, with XY males and XX females. But what gene(s) may be responsible for determining whether a particular plant carries male or female flowers has been a long-standing mystery. Recently, the authors combed through the genomes of persimmon trees looking for genes that were exclusive to males and found pair of genes, called OGI and MeGI. In females, MeGI builds to high level and acts like a neutering agent, repressing pollen formation. In males, OGI prevents the accumulation of MeGI. Discovery of the OGI-MeGI system in persimmon opens up new possibilities in plant breeding. Controlling flower organs is also important for facilitating production of high yielding hybrids from controlled hybridization of selected inbreds. Broader impacts include an outreach aimed at increasing skills and confidence in Big Data Analysis for high school or early college students of underpresented background. Additionally, because dioecy evolved independently many times in plants, this work provides a foundation to ask whether plants invented similar or different solutions to the same problem.  These results cast light on the organization of a plant Y chromosome and provide a working model for dioecy determination in Diospyros species. The authors aim to capitalize on these findings to further investigate the molecular function of the OGI and MeGI genes, as well as ask more general questions about the evolution of dioecy determination in dioecious species. Their specific objectives are to: 1) Define the Y chromosome in Diospyros lotus using a combination of sequencing and genetic approaches 2) Unravel the molecular function of OGI and MeGI using transgenic technology in A. thaliana and genome-wide genomic analyses in Diospryros and 3) Characterize variation in the Y-chromosome dioecy determination region in Diospyros and closely-related species and test whether similar systems are at play in other dioecious systems. This work provides a model for unraveling dioecy determination systems in economically-relevant plant species, an area important for human sustenance and well being.

923,"Coatings are often characterized/classified by their application or functionality, and the economic impact of coating technologies is staggering and estimated to be in the trillions. Therefore, even incremental improvements in coating properties have an impact, and revolutionary improvements in the coatings could lead to quantum leaps in the technologies that rely on these coatings. In this context, atomically thin layers, commonly known as ?two dimensional materials?, exhibiting highly tunable properties, can be engineered to solve fundamental scientific and technological challenges in the coating arena. This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) is devoted to the design and development of advanced coatings based on two-dimensional (2D) and layered materials (Center for Atomically Thin Multifunctional Coatings -ATOMIC). Key to the center is a diverse set of industrial partners (glass, polymer, coating manufacturers, electronics and automobile companies, equipment/tools manufacturers, national labs, and small businesses). ATOMIC is a unique synergistic effort that exploits the unprecedented properties of 2D nanomaterials and establishes the foundations to revolutionize multifunctional coatings. The center activities are student-centric, focused on carrying out transformational and applied research, developing intellectual property, providing student mentorship, internships, and undertaking technology transfer.  ATOMIC synergistically integrates world-leading faculty, researchers, students and staff from The Pennsylvania State University and Rice University with industry and national laboratories. ATOMIC advances coating science and technology in key strategic areas including: corrosion, oxidation and abrasion resistance, friction and wear, energy storage/harvesting, large-scale synthesis and deposition of multifunctional coatings, and others. The ATOMIC goals are: 1) Demonstrate the importance of fundamental and pre-competitive research for economic growth; 2) Establish an innovative scientific and technological platform to develop novel coatings based on 2D systems; 2) Develop fundamental process/property relationships in 2D materials driven by industry needs; 3) Standardizing measurement, characterization, and modeling techniques for benchmarking coating performances; 4) Build and maintain strong relationships with industry to advance ATOMIC research and to facilitate knowledge transfer to ATOMIC members; 5) Educate undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars, who will become effective members of the research community in this interdisciplinary area, and 6) Broaden participation in STEM through a strong outreach program aimed at all levels of education, ethnicities and minorities.

924,"To ensure the safety of the world's food supply given the threats of rapid population growth and declining arable land and water resources, innovative strategies for breeding the next generation of high-yield potential and climate-resilient crops will have to be implemented. New research strategies should create novel crop traits that have not yet been achieved in order to substantially enhance yield potential under marginal environments. How can this enormous goal be attained? It is now fully appreciated that any further improvements in genetic potential for yield, stress tolerance and water and nutrient use efficiency will have to rely on the ability to create complex genomic configurations that lead to novel biochemical and physiological traits. This project represents the use of contemporary research tools to solve an old puzzle. It represents a closer look and more strategic examination of one of the most enigmatic and relatively unexploited concepts in plant genetics, the phenomenon of transgressive variation. Transgressive variation is observed when progeny derived from two divergent parents are superior (or inferior) to both parents. Using rice to test the concept, this project will determine which DNA segments or RNA molecules cause transgressive traits for salinity and low temperature stress tolerance.  This project will test the hypothesis that transgressive stress tolerance phenotypes in biparental cross combinations of rice are the consequences of ideal shuffling and complementation effects between two divergent parental genomes leading to genetic network rewiring. New paradigms built upon the power of regulon restructuring, regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and DNA methylation will be explored to understand the intricate mechanisms by which novel gene expression patterns mediate transgression from parental phenotypes. By integrated use of various next-generation DNA sequencing applications such as genome-Seq, mRNA-Seq, ncRNA-Seq, and bisulfite-Seq, this project will: 1) discover stress-regulated miRNAs/siRNAs that are transgressively expressed in intraspecific recombinants with novel salt tolerance phenotypes, and those that are transgressively expressed in interspecific recombinants with novel low temperature or other stress tolerance attributes; 2) establish meaningful correlations between mRNA and miRNA/siRNA transcriptome signatures among recombinants and their respective parents to evelop hypotheses on how global gene expression is altered in transgressive segregants; and 3) establish meaningful correlations between transcriptome signatures and genome methylation profiles between recombinants and their parents to develop hypotheses on how epigenomic changes alter gene regulation in transgressive segregants. The approach will address the possibilities that: a) stress tolerance phenotypic transgression is due to regulatory genes that acquired optimal function because of compatible regulatory clusters in their new genetic background, i.e., regulon restructuring; b) network reconfiguration in recombinants is due to coupling or uncoupling of trans-acting ncRNAs and their target regulatory genes or genomic loci from either parents; and c) genome shuffling alters the methylation profiles in recombinants leading to novel gene expression signatures. Outcomes will advance our understanding of the intricacies of genetic and epigenetic networks towards applications to stress tolerance breeding in rice and other major cereal crops. The genomics datasets to be generated will be made available to the broader scientific community through public data repositories including the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI and DDBJ. The rice genetic stocks to be characterized will be made available to other researchers through the USDA rice genetic stock maintenance and distribution center.

925,"With this award supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF), and EPSCoR programs, Professor Jessie Carrick from Tennessee Technological University and colleagues Daniel Swartling, Jeffrey Rice, William Carroll and Xuanzhi Zhan will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broadband nitrogen-cooled cryoprobe. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The nitrogen-cooled probe will provide a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students. The new instrument will have a significant and immediate impact on the research training and teaching endeavors of faculty in the departments of Chemistry as well as Chemical Engineering and an interdisciplinary Environmental Sciences Program. The presence of a reliable instrument equipped with a sample changer will allow much greater student access to a spectrometer in the teaching laboratories than an old, low-field instrument currently at this university. The PIs indicate that the instrument will be utilized by students in the sophomore organic courses, the advanced analytical laboratory, and an advanced organic spectroscopy course. Special emphasis will be directed to women and other historically underrepresented students in STEM.  The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesizing bis-1,2,4-triazine ligands, including conformational and subsequent complexation studies with simulated actinides for potential remediation of used nuclear fuel; (b) structurally characterizing fluorescent proteins for nerve regeneration and wound healing; (c) developing solution phase structure approaches for dynamic molecules; (d) studying conformations of arrestin proteins; (e) developing green chemistry methodology; and (f) studying thiosemicarbazone ligands as potential anti-cancer therapeutics.

926,"This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Michael S. Campbell is  Of Rice and Men: Graph-Based Tools and Resources for Advancing Genome Assisted Crop Improvement   The host institutions for the fellowship are Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories and EMBL-EBI and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Doreen Ware and Dr. Paul Kersey.  Humans have been domesticating crop plants to increase yield and productivity ever since agriculture began over 10,000 years ago. Genome sequencing in the last decade now provides unprecedented resources for mining crops for new traits and for advancing breeding methods. These DNA sequences can now be used to guide the future of plant breeding through a process called genome assisted crop improvement. Central to genome assisted crop improvement is the use of a single consensus, or 'reference' DNA sequence to represent the genome of an entire species. Unfortunately, these reference sequences do not capture sequence variation characteristic of every population. Breeding is therefore hampered without full access to the diversity of gene variants.  Recently, the human genomics community has begun to experiment with a promising solution to this problem called a 'Variant Graph', wherein a graph structure is used to represent sequence variation that is lost with the reference-genome approach. In this project, Variant Graphs will be developed for rice as a model crop plant, will help to identify new trait variants and will ultimately be applicable to any crop species. The outcomes will provide essential information to plant breeders and therefore significantly impact the speed and performance of crop improvement efforts, helping to ensure a secure and constant food supply.   This project will develop methods for, and explore the utility of, a Variant Graph approach to create a pan-genome reference and structural annotation resource for rice, starting with the genomes of three diverse rice strains and then expanding to 3,000. The bioinformatics and statistically based approach to genome representation and annotation will give a population level view of the variant material available to plant breeders and will provide a clear picture of the genome of each individual accession. The research efforts are directed towards rice genomes, but the tools and techniques developed are relevant to all agricultural plants and animals. The infrastructure to replicate this resource for other agricultural plants will be established and made available through the iPlant Collaborative (iplantcollaborative.org). The rice resources will be publicly available through the Gramene website (gramene.org).

927,"This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Alejandra I. Huerta is  Characterization and identification of a novel bacterial resistance mechanism that confers complete immunity to a major pathogen of rice.  The host institution for this fellowship is Colorado State University, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Jan E. Leach and Lindsay Triplett.  The identification and characterization of new sources of resistance in rice is of particular importance in the context of global food security. Intensified rice production has resulted in higher disease pressures and yield loss due to bacterial disease such as bacterial leaf streak (BLS), caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, yet no BLS resistance genes have been identified, hampering both an understanding of disease causation and prevention. The fellowship research investigates how the pathogen both triggers and suppresses resistance in an ancient cultivated variety of rice, Carolina Gold, grown in the United States by elucidating mechanisms at the molecular level, i.e., the role of surface-exposed amino acid residues in proteins produced by the pathogen and that interact with the host.  Training goals include gaining mastery of molecular tools in plant biology, bioinformatics including genome mining, and science communication. Educational outreach is through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Education Migrant Education Program to develop hands-on, tangible and accessible scientific workshops and outreach activities to engage children from migrant farming communities into STEM.

928,"Neutron stars that are magnetars are some of the most interesting compact objects in the Universe.  There are perhaps as many as 30 presently identified with many of them exhibiting powerful outbursts of high energy X-rays.  Magnetars present a unique forum for testing fundamental physics that is not presently accessible in terrestrial laboratories.  Having great faith in the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), astrophysicists routinely model neutron star environments by using untested theoretical predictions for high magnetic field domains.  Because magnetars provide the laboratory for performing these tests, understanding their character is central to using them as a proxy QED physics laboratory.  This project makes significant steps in this direction by developing computer simulations to study the region above the surface of magnetars.  This research project offers a significant element of graduate and undergraduate training with the involvement of students in research and teaching.  One or two PhD students will be engaged as an integral part of the work with the results leading to doctoral theses.  These students will be involved in undergraduate pedagogy by teaching at least one lecture per year on neutron stars in appropriate Rice courses.  One or more undergraduates will be enlisted to work on smaller, self-contained portions of the research for their senior theses at Rice.  These students are expected to present their research results to peers at Rice in research group seminars.  Continuing an established relationship with the Houston Astronomical Society, the PI will also present aspects of this work and highlights of the exciting field of neutron stars to the general public.  In more technical terms, this project develops a Monte Carlo simulation to describe radiative transfer in magnetar magnetospheres, mostly in closed field zones.  The code will compute the interaction between X-rays and hot, relativistic electrons in Compton scattering events, tracking the energy exchange between them and accounting for changes in photon polarization.  New physics formalism for the magnetic Compton cross section will be developed to account for the multiple cyclotron resonances that will dominate the opacity.  Other processes will be modeled including photon splitting and magnetic pair creation, and their effect on attenuating soft gamma-rays above around 100 keV will be assessed.  New physics developments of the magnetic two-photon pair creation cross section will be performed to facilitate the attenuation calculations.  The creation of pairs will be incorporated and the generation of polarization signatures will be both a necessity for precision and also a highlight, increasing the diagnostic potential of the modeling.  Specifically, capturing polarization information may provide the means to disentangle geometrical source information and the signatures of strong-field QED physics.  Key physics analysis developments for positron-electron pair creation and Compton scattering will be a feature of the work and will provide new tools for astrophysicists to employ in other problems.  As a broader scientific element, the polarization considerations of this program will aid in defining agendas and motivations for polarimetric telescopes in the X-ray and soft gamma-ray bands.  Three outstanding questions pertaining to these sources that are at the forefront of scientific interest at the moment will be impacted significantly by this project.  These are (i) whether or not magnetars are inherently different from normal pulsars, or is their emission driven by similar physics operating in different portions of neutron star parameter space, (ii) what causes the maximum energies of flares to be generally calibrated to around 100--300 keV; and (iii) where exactly is the site of energy injection in the magnetosphere that seeds non-thermal radiation in magnetars, i.e., how proximate is this locale to the stellar surface and/or the magnetic equator?

930,"Biomolecular simulation is rapidly growing in popularity and scope of application. It is no longer the preserve of a few specialist groups but is widespread - part of the  toolkit  used by researchers in a wide variety of fields, often closely integrated with other experimental research techniques. As the use of biomolecular simulation grows, a corresponding boom in software development is taking place. Giving researchers the right tools and training to develop such software will reduce the extent of 'wheel-reinvention', consequently improve research productivity, and make research more cost-effective. An important question that arises however, is how to we judge the effectiveness of the tools and training used. In order to develop answers to such questions the CECAM Extended Software Development workshop on biomolecular simulations, will be held in Juelich, Germany on October 12-25 2015. This workshop will provide hands-on tutorials incorporating active learning approaches. The workshop will advance the way interdisciplinary computational science training is conducted as well as how tools to support computational science are developed. This grant is being jointly funded by the ACI Division in CISE and by the CHE Division in MPS and will provide travel support for up to twelve US-based scientists to attend this workshop and contribute to achieving workshop objectives.  The impact of this workshop will be significant in three directions: It will (i) provide support for US junior and early career scientists to learn a plethora of new tools and techniques central to their science, (ii) lead to an improvement to the software tools being developed as well as the methodology by which the effectiveness of tools is assessed, and (iii) move towards a method of data-driven and dynamic organization of workshops. This provides a natural evolution in the sophistication of simple  hackathons . It will provide a template for how future multidisciplinary hands-on workshops training can be organized.  Lessons learned from this workshop will be used as a basis to improve future computational science classes at Rutgers, Rice and elsewhere. The workshop participants will be selected in order to have a broad representation of the communities we want to engage. The PIs will have a special outreach activity to early career scientists (newly established faculty and post-doctoral researchers) as well as graduate students, and will encourage the participation of minorities and women. This workshop will (i) improve the ability of non-computing specialist scientists to utilize existing tools and software better, but also help formulate their needs and requirements better, (ii) enable tool-smiths to answer a critical and recurring question of how to separate the impact and suitability of tools from the effectiveness of the techniques used to teach and train, (iii) develop exercises that will not only improve scientific productivity but also enable domain scientists to understand how to employ tools that reach adequate scales seamlessly from their local environments to remote resources, (iv) propose an agenda and a set of exercises that will be adaptive based upon real-time feedback and assessment, and serve as a template that can be generalized and instantiated to other domains.

931,"This project will convene a three-day workshop to explore natural and social science linkages between food, energy, and water (FEW) systems in large river ecosystems.  This workshop will bring together 30-50 persons with scientific and/or policy expertise within one or more elements of the FEWS nexus with the goal of identifying key drivers and linkages, emergent properties, and critical research needs within the context of ecological sustainability.  The participants will focus on the Mekong River Basin as an archetypal FEW coupled social-ecological system. More than 60 million people living in the Mekong are highly dependent on the river for food and livelihoods.  Wild-caught fish and rice are the primary sources of nutrition, with the productivity of both fisheries and rice agriculture dependent on the natural flood-pulse hydrologic regime.  The river is facing potentially large changes to the flood-pulse from mainstream and tributary hydropower development, rapid land use change and climate change.  The economic benefits of new energy are expected to be substantial, but the social and environmental impacts are at present poorly understood.  Fisheries/agriculture, hydrologic dynamics, and hydropower therefore form the food, water, and energy trilemma in the Mekong and are linked in both space and time.  The results of this workshop will create a foundation for understanding the interconnected and interdependent nature of FEW dynamics in the Mekong and other river ecosystems.  The project will support both education and diversity by enhancing the scientific capacity of Mekong scientists and underrepresented groups.  Large river ecosystems provide numerous and dynamic ecosystem goods and services to people.  Despite a general understanding of the types of goods and services derived from rivers and a widespread recognition of their social and economic benefit, there is a distinct lack of conceptual and quantitative frameworks for evaluating the physical, biological, and social dynamics that create ecosystem services and livelihoods.  As such, there is limited ability to understand impacts from ecosystem change and to evaluate tradeoffs.  This workshop will begin to address these limitations by: 1) developing a conceptual model of how multiple physical, social, and ecological processes connect and structure FEW systems in large rivers; 2) within this framework identify key linkages and flows for maintaining sustainability; 3) evaluate currently available data and capacity for quantifying these processes; and 4) identify key future research needs for addressing research conceptual and data gaps. The principal investigators have identified an initial set of 60 potential invitees, including international representation from a range of institutions active in the Mekong region. These include academic, governmental (US and Mekong), intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The investigators intend to invite 50-70 participants expecting 30-35 to attend with greater than 40% participation by women and underrepresented minorities. Specific products will include a white paper and journal article describing the current status and frontier of Food Water Energy research in rivers, as well as digital archiving.  Development of new collaborations to address critical research questions is a specific goal of the workshop and is strongly anticipated. The broader impacts will include direct engagement of Mekong scientists and policy stakeholders from governmental and non-governmental institutions in all aspect of the workshop to ensure that outcomes are relevant to stakeholder needs and available for uptake in the decision making process.  All products from the workshop will be made feely available via the project website, the Mekong portal at the University of Washington, mekong.uw.edu, and through the Florida State University Mekong portal at coss.fsu.edu/mekong.  This research will contribute to improved scientific capacity in the region through participation of Mekong scientists in the workshop planning, execution, and publication of workshop outputs.

932,"This project uses the fundamentals of material science to tackle the pressing needs for designing safe and failure-resistant concrete structures for extreme thermal and radiological environments. This approach can have a significant impact on discovering new cementitious materials with improved service life and safety for use in key public infrastructures such as nuclear power plants and oil and gas reservoirs, and will impact several other areas such as safe landing areas for airplanes and tunnel liners exposed to fire. The education program will develop new engineering modules and curricula that will be broadly disseminated to catalyze the fusion of computational material science and extreme conditions. Furthermore, underrepresented students and women will be recruited and retained in STEM areas through the professional Engineering Leadership Alliance at Rice University.  The overarching technical objective is to fundamentally understand the physiochemical degradation processes of Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate (C-S-H), the smallest building blocks of concrete, at elevated temperatures and radiations, followed by utilization of this knowledge to design new intercalated hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN)/C-S-H composites. The underlying methodology lies in developing atomistic simulations connected to advanced synthesis and characterization techniques to understand and control the basic degradation phenomena at the heart of conventional and hybrid cement-based materials. This project will be innovative in its attempts to unravel the complex behavior of C-S-H under irradiation using collision cascade simulations. Intercalation of exfoliated hBN sheets with an optimum thickness into the sub-nanometer basal spaces of C-S-H are novel elements in cementitious materials. The research will link the complex ab-initio scale of chemistry, electron transfer, and radiation- and temperature-induced deterioration processes with the scale of mechanics. As such, this project will potentially lead to a new line of research in cementitious and infrastructure materials.

933,"Title: A Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology Enabled Water Treatment.  Access to safe drinking water is a basic need for all life on the planet. It is a grand challenge linked to public health, energy production, and sustainable development. This is not just a need in the developing world. Over 40 million Americans are not connected to a municipal water system and rely on the quality of the water available from wells. The quality of this water varies with location and climate change exacerbates fresh water scarcity. The technologies that result from the research of this center will broaden access to clean drinking water with a variety of potential sources (e.g. groundwater from wells, salt water, brackish water, or recycled industrial water). The modular systems that will be designed will address drinking water from the scale of a household, to a neighborhood to a remote town. These technologies will also find application to help people get drinking water during natural disasters. In addition to drinking water, the Center will improve the water  footprint  of oil and gas exploration and production operations by helping to increase the quality of water cleanup for reuse and recycle. The environmental impact of water use in these industrial settings will be improved, saving energy and water resources. Students trained in this Center will have a multidisciplinary, team-based research experience with the skills needed to translate their research to a broad set of stakeholders (e.g., industrial organizations, governmental organizations, and citizens) that lack a secure source of clean water.  The ERC is led by Rice University, with partners at Arizona State University, University of Texas-El Paso and Yale University. The Center's use of nanotechnology will allow the design and manufacture of multifunctional nanomaterials to adsorb a wide variety of pollutants including oxo-anions, total dissolved solids, nitrates, salts, organics, foulants, scalants, viruses and microbes. These nanomaterials will be immobilized in membranes that are packaged into system modules. The use of modules offers flexibility of targeted pollutant(s) and end-use application capacity or scale of delivered water rate. Novel photonic, electronic, catalytic, and magnetic engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) will introduce new approaches to transform water treatment from a large, chemical- and energy-intensive process toward compact physical and catalytic systems. These innovations will benefit multiple stakeholders, from rural communities and locations hit by natural disasters to hydraulic fracturing oil and gas sites, where reuse of produced waters minimizes regional environmental impacts. The Center's innovative technologies are founded on rigorous basic research. Component technologies include fouling-resistant, high-permeability membranes that use ENMs for surface self-cleaning and biofilm control; capacitive deionization with highly conductive and selective electrodes to remove scalants (divalent ions); rapid magnetic separation of paramagnetic nanosorbents for easy reuse; nanophotonics-enabled direct solar membrane distillation for low-energy desalination; disinfection and advanced oxidation/reduction using nanocatalysts; and template-assisted nanocrystallization for scaling control. Fundamental research on ENM interactions with water pollutants and substrate materials; integrated unit processes that immobilize, support, or recover ENMs; and safety by design demonstrated in testbeds will ensure that the Center's systems are resilient, economical, and highly efficient.

934,"Magnaporthales, an order of fungi with over 200 species, contains important pathogens of cereals and grasses, including the rice blast fungus.  The rice blast fungus is the most destructive disease of rice, which is a staple food source for about half of the world's human population. Despite their scientific and economic importance, Magnaporthales fungi have not been studied comprehensively, and the diversity, taxonomy and evolutionary relationships of Magnaporthales species remain unsettled.  There is no consensus on which scientific name to use for these important pathogens, and this impedes communication among scientists, animal and plant health inspection services, and other user communities around the world.  Recent major changes in the international naming system for fungi have added to the confusion of names and distributions for these fungi. This project will generate molecular data and evolutionary analyses for the understudied species that will be presented in a comprehensive monograph on the Magnaporthales, which will available online to researchers and the broader user communities worldwide at no cost. This research will facilitate future work on Magnaporthales systematics, genetics, biodiversity, plant protection and quarantine feasibility.  The major objectives of this project are: 1) to sample from the understudied grassland ecosystems, and to discover, diagnose and describe new taxa in Magnaporthales using both traditional culture-based and next-generation metagenomic sequencing methods; 2) to build a robust phylogenomic tree for all Magnaporthales taxa; 3) to use the phylogeny in improving our understanding of the evolution of pathogenicity and other traits of Magnaporthales fungi; 4) to produce a global monograph of Magnaporthales; and 5) to train students and postdocs to conduct research across the entire spectrum of these activities. The project includes studies of phylogenomics, evolution, taxonomy, biodiversity, organismal biology and metagenomics. The global monograph of Magnaporthales will include: traditional morphological descriptions, diagnostic illustrations, distribution maps, host-range information, interactive identification keys to genera and species, as well as DNA barcodes. Genomic sequences for the representative taxa also will be linked to the cyber-enabled monograph. The PI will engage high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow, with a focus on teaching and training of underrepresented minorities.

935,"This award will provide support for the career development of a junior investigator in the area of Earth Sciences. The study will foster new collaborations and enhance old partnerships with scientists at the University of Arizona and Rice University. This project will constitute the intellectual basis and support the training for three undergraduate students. A classroom- and field-based outreach program, through University of Arizona Extension and intended for students in grades 6-8, will be integrated with this research. Course materials produced through this program will be shared with the geosciences community through the Science Education Resource Center (SERC). The results from this study will contribute to the fundamental goals of Earthscope and will be published in major peer-reviewed scientific journals and in an article for non-specialists. Data resulting from this study will be made accessible to the public in Integrated Earth Data Applications, EarthChem, and PetDB databases.  A growing body of geophysical data suggests geologically recent mobility of the continental mantle beneath western North America. Several lines of evidence suggest that mantle lithosphere beneath southern California was tectonically displaced eastward by a Late Cretaceous episode of shallow subduction and  relaminated  to the base of the continental lithosphere beneath the Colorado Plateau transition zone (central Arizona). The principal investigator will test this hypothesis by comparing the petrogenetic and thermal histories of mantle xenoliths derived from both areas. If Arizona and California xenolith suites evolved in a similar manner, then a strong case can be made for major Phanerozoic displacement and subsequent reconstruction of southwest U.S. mantle lithosphere. This study will provide a geodynamic and geologic context to understand mantle displacements beneath western North America. This research will provide key constraints on the origin and evolution of mantle lithosphere beneath the southwest U.S., an enhanced ability to recognize modern and ancient analogous settings worldwide, an improved understanding of the effects of subduction angle on the stability of mantle lithosphere at craton active margin transition zones, and a high probability of recognizing a remnant of the southern California mantle lithosphere that has been  relaminated  beneath central Arizona. This result would imply a >500 km tectonic displacement of the southern California mantle fragment and provide intriguing explanations for the long-term strength of the Colorado Plateau relative to adjacent geologic provinces and for active lithospheric delamination beneath the plateau.

936,"The mango was first domesticated in India more than 4,000 years ago. Today, mangoes are grown on six continents and are one of the world's most important tropical fruits. In the face of climate change and a growing human population, agriculture must strive to improve crop yields while facing new and variable climatic conditions. Traits to deal with these stressors, like drought tolerance and disease resistance, can be introduced into crops through crop breeding programs. Although hundreds of plant species have undergone domestication, many concepts about the impacts of domestication on genetic diversity have come from research focusing on short-lived crops like maize and rice. This focus has left gaps in our knowledge about domestication in other plant species, such as fruit trees. During the process of domestication, many crops lose genetic diversity, which can result in the unintentional loss of beneficial traits that could be useful for agriculture. However, some evidence that suggests long-lived plants, like fruit trees, may be less susceptible to the negative impacts of domestication. This project will build on recent efforts to expand scientific insight into the domestication of non-staple crops by providing a basic understanding of the evolutionary history of the mango, and will lay the groundwork for future breeding programs to improve its agricultural qualities. Following its original domestication, the mango, Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae), was dispersed throughout the tropics and warm subtropics. However, the eastward and westward migrations of Mangifera  indica may have had strikingly different effects on the genetic structure and diversity of cultivated mango. During its journey westward through Africa and on to the Americas, Mangifera  indica suffered a series of population bottlenecks, suggesting that a limited amount of the crop's genetic diversity reached the New World. Conversely, eastward expansion into Southeast Asia brought it into contact with more than 35 other Mangifera species. Morphological evidence and preliminary genetic data indicate that the genetic diversity of M. indica in SE Asia may have been bolstered by gene flow from these wild relatives. This research will use double digest restriction site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to investigate genetic diversity, population differentiation, and hybridization in 192 Mangifera accessions cultivated at Botanic Gardens around the world, including 116 M. indica cultivars of known geographic origin and 76 accessions from four other regionally-cultivated Mangifera species.

937,"In the Gulf of Maine region, rapid warming of the ocean surface in recent years has raised concern in the research and resource management communities, fishing industry and the general public about effects on the coastal marine ecosystem. This interdisciplinary, collaborative project will improve understanding of the physical and biological processes controlling the abundance of a planktonic animal that is particularly important in the food web of the northeast coastal ocean. About the size of a grain of rice, the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus is the primary prey for herring and other forage fish, as well as for the endangered northern right whale. This study will examine whether transport of C. finmarchicus into the Gulf of Maine from cold Canadian waters, in combination with growth and reproduction in the relatively cold Maine Coastal Current, is sufficient to supply the region with the numbers needed to attract and nourish the fish, seabirds and mammals that rely on its energy rich life stages, despite recent ocean warming. The research team will develop a computer model that links extensive understanding of the species' life history with ocean currents and temperature. Results from the model will be tested against field collections at two locations. This study will also contribute to the new Integrated Sentinel Monitoring Network, a joint effort planned by federal and state agencies with academic research participation to monitor future ecosystem change on the northeastern coastal shelf. It will train a graduate student and postdoctoral scientist in interdisciplinary research and also provide support for an early-career investigator.The project will take a process modeling approach that takes into account regional and mesoscale interaction between life history and bathymetry and circulation to improve understanding of planktonic species distribution shifts. It will combine two decades of research on Calanus finmarchicus life history, including diapause, with a high resolution regional circulation model into an innovative application of a three dimensional, physical-biological model. The modeling approach represents an advancement of climate forecasts of species ranges by coupling a Lagrangian perspective with local processes to better resolve complex range boundaries. It will use Lagrangian parameters such as finite-scale or finite-time Lyapunov exponents, translating particle trajectories into scalar fields that represent the structure of the advective regime. The model will be informed by and tested with measurements of vital rates and demographic data collected on a research vessel at two time series stations.

941,"In the Gulf of Maine region, rapid warming of the ocean surface in recent years has raised concern in the research and resource management communities, fishing industry and the general public about effects on the coastal marine ecosystem. This interdisciplinary, collaborative project will improve understanding of the physical and biological processes controlling the abundance of a planktonic animal that is particularly important in the food web of the northeast coastal ocean. About the size of a grain of rice, the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus is the primary prey for herring and other forage fish, as well as for the endangered northern right whale. This study will examine whether transport of C. finmarchicus into the Gulf of Maine from cold Canadian waters, in combination with growth and reproduction in the relatively cold Maine Coastal Current, is sufficient to supply the region with the numbers needed to attract and nourish the fish, seabirds and mammals that rely on its energy rich life stages, despite recent ocean warming. The research team will develop a computer model that links extensive understanding of the species' life history with ocean currents and temperature. Results from the model will be tested against field collections at two locations. This study will also contribute to the new Integrated Sentinel Monitoring Network, a joint effort planned by federal and state agencies with academic research participation to monitor future ecosystem change on the northeastern coastal shelf. It will train a graduate student and postdoctoral scientist in interdisciplinary research and also provide support for an early-career investigator.The project will take a process modeling approach that takes into account regional and mesoscale interaction between life history and bathymetry and circulation to improve understanding of planktonic species distribution shifts. It will combine two decades of research on Calanus finmarchicus life history, including diapause, with a high resolution regional circulation model into an innovative application of a three dimensional, physical-biological model. The modeling approach represents an advancement of climate forecasts of species ranges by coupling a Lagrangian perspective with local processes to better resolve complex range boundaries. It will use Lagrangian parameters such as finite-scale or finite-time Lyapunov exponents, translating particle trajectories into scalar fields that represent the structure of the advective regime. The model will be informed by and tested with measurements of vital rates and demographic data collected on a research vessel at two time series stations. It will be used in backward-in-time and forward-in-time modes to test hypotheses about sources and destinations of C. finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine, effects of match/mismatch in phenologies, and exploration effects of climate forced scenarios on advective pathways.

944,"Gustavo Scuseria of Rice University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop novel, efficient and accurate methods to treat molecules and materials in which the motion of electrons is strongly correlated.  Computational methods play a key role in understanding chemical and physical behavior and therefore can help guide the development of transformative technologies which rely on novel material properties.  However, there are important problems for which the existing techniques are inadequate.  Most prominently, current computational tools do not properly describe the strong correlations which are responsible for superconductivity and various important magnetic phenomena.  This research seeks to remedy that deficiency by extending conventional methods in a new and unique direction.  These new methods will be applied to study the strong correlations in graphitic systems, which serve as prototypes for systems displaying magnetic ordering.  In the longer term, the tools developed in this proposal will be useful for other researchers in chemistry, physics, and materials science as well.  A diverse group of graduate students and postdoctoral associates are involved in carrying out this research. In order to accomplish these goals, Scuseria and coworkers  combine the recently developed pair coupled cluster theory (which is able to describe strong static correlations) with Lie algebraic similarity transformation (which is able to describe the remaining weak correlations needed to reach quantitative accuracy).  The combination of these two techniques should describe both strong and weak correlations with reasonable expense while avoiding the unphysical symmetry breaking which more conventional methods require but which makes their predictions somewhat suspect.  The applications to fullerenes, graphene nanoribbons, and nanodots will demonstrate the capabilities of this new computational approach and will help explain their unique properties.

945,"Seeds of flowering plants are distinguished by the presence of a novel tissue - endosperm. Endosperm is the product of a second fertilization event, but rather than developing into a second embryo, it becomes a tissue that mediates the relationship between the maternal plant and its compatriot embryo. Endosperm is also an essential part of the human diet: the seeds that provide most of the calories people consume (rice, wheat, corn) consist primarily of endosperm. Studies in model plant species have begun to piece together the mechanisms that control endosperm development, and have revealed that gene imprinting plays an important role. Imprinting occurs when an allele inherited from one parent is silenced. Little scientific attention has been given to how imprinting has evolved in flowering plants. This project will address this discrepancy by analyzing the expression of genes during development of endosperm in the water lily, which is a member of one of the most ancient lineages of flowering plants. While the water lily is uniquely suited to become a model system for the early diverging lineages, it is also on the brink of extinction - making it a compelling case for why exploring and preserving biodiversity is essential for furthering basic scientific research.   Analysis of gene expression will be accomplished by creating RNA-seq transcriptomes of key stages during ovule and seed development. From this dataset, two main categories of genes will be targeted for homolog identification: genes that are involved in imprinting-regulation mechanisms and genes that are themselves imprinted. Simple presence/absence of homologs of these genes during seed development in N. thermarum will help to resolve the question of when during angiosperm evolution did these mechanisms became important regulators of endosperm development. In addition, the sampling scheme will make it possible to distinguish suites of gene activity that correlate to specific sets of developmental processes. Finally, the accompanying sequence and expression data will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of relevant gene families. This database will represent an important resource for understanding the evolution of angiosperm seeds, and will be made publically available.

946,"The Fall 2015 meeting of the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference will be at Rice University on November 6-8, 2015. To date the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 52 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington. By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and young people. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select young faculty at these institutions. The theme of the upcoming conference at Rice University will concentrate on  Metric and Conformal Geometry . Accelerated by the work of Gromov, metric techniques have gained an important place in Riemannian geometry, especially in the study of conformal structures. This development has deeply affected understanding, particularly of Teichmuller spaces, conformal dynamics, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and symmetric spaces of non-positive curvature. In recent years, some of these metric techniques have also been important in the study of certain random conformal processes. The conference features leading researchers in these various fields, each of which has roots in metric and conformal geometry. http://math.rice.edu/NewsEvents/Conferences/TGTC2015/ Advertising; Affect; austin; base; Communities; design; Development; Disabled Persons; Event; Faculty; falls; Fees; Fostering; Geographic Locations; Geometry; graduate student; Historically Black Colleges and Universities; Human Resources; Individual; Institution; International; Mathematics; meetings; Minority; Plant Roots; Process; Research; Research Personnel; Rice; Schools; Series; Structure; symposium; Techniques; Texas; Time; Universities; Woman; WorkTEXAS GEOMETRY AND TOPOLOGY CONFERENCE",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
947,"Crop yields depend on effective uptake of water and nutrients by the roots.  A current challenge is to understand how crop plants regulate the formation and function of their roots.  An understanding of the genes that control roots at this level would help plant breeders tailor root traits to match new agricultural practices, land use patterns, and suboptimal soils.  In this project, genome-wide gene expression will be defined from roots and root hairs from a wide range of crop plants and their relatives under various environmental conditions. These gene expression patterns will be analyzed to identify key genes that control the formation and function of roots. Further, these large gene expression datasets will provide a valuable tool for scientists studying many aspects of root biology. The knowledge obtained from this project is expected to provide new insight into the origin, diversification, and conservation of molecular mechanisms used to regulate the formation and function of roots and root hairs of plants. Further, given the important roles of roots/root hairs for plant growth and environmental response, these findings are expected to assist the rational design of strategies to manipulate root and root hair architecture in crop plants, a particularly important goal given concerns about nutrient-poor soils and the impact of environmental change.  This project will provide strong interdisciplinary training for the participating undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. A major outreach activity of this project is a collaborative research visitor exchange program with the College of Charleston (SC), a primarily undergraduate institution, to provide large-scale genomic and computational biology experiences to students who are unable to obtain this training at their home institution. The project will participate in the Michigan Biological Scholars Program, a bridging program assisting first-year undergraduates in the life sciences, especially underrepresented minorities. Finally, aspects of this research will be incorporated into a semester-long laboratory exercise as part of an advanced molecular development course at the University of Michigan. With the rapidly expanding gene and genome sequences available in plants, it is now possible to consider the ultimate goal of defining the gene activities present in every organ and cell type in species throughout the plant kingdom.  This knowledge would dramatically improve the understanding of plant processes and their diversity, and will likely lead to new opportunities for manipulating crop plants. This project is designed as a first step toward this ultimate goal by defining gene expression in a simple plant organ (the root) and a simple plant cell type (the root hair) in diverse plant species. In a preliminary study, expression data has been generated from seven species (rice, maize, soybean, cucumber, tomato, Arabidopsis, and Selaginella), demonstrating the feasibility and potential impact of the proposed research.  This project has two major objectives. The first is to identify sets of regulatory genes associated with specific root structural and functional traits, by defining transcriptomes from the three major zones of activity for the primary roots and other root types from a diverse set of crop plants. In the second objective, cell-specific regulatory genes will be defined by linking gene expression and cell characteristics in the root hair cells from these same plant species grown under normal and nutrient stress conditions. The results of this project are expected to have a significant impact on the plant research community, through the generation of root-zone-specific and root-hair-specific expression data from many diverse species, which will assist efforts to assign function to unknown genes, predict functional homologs, and assess gene evolutionary history. The data and materials produced by this project will be available at the project website (http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/PGRP-roots), the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA, http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

948,"Plant cell suspension cultures are being investigated as a safe, cost-efficient, and scalable platform for the production of human therapeutic proteins. However, a major barrier for commercialization of this technology is the difference in the N¿\glycosylation of proteins produced by humans and plants: the presence of plant-specific glycan structures can reduce the drug¿¿s efficacy and potentially cause an unwanted immune response. Thus, the goal of this work is to characterize the glycan profile of a protein therapeutic produced in a transgenic rice cell culture. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Kazuhito Fujiyama of Osaka University, an expert in analysis and modification of plant-made glycoproteins, and will enable use of his research group¿¿s highly specialized protocols, equipment, and expertise.  The glycan profile will be determined for rice cell culture-produced butyrylcholinesterase, a native human enzyme used for the treatment of exposure to organophosphorus nerve agents such as sarin. The protein will be analyzed using liquid chromatography¿Cmass spectrometry, and the resulting data will be processed using bioinformatics software and databases of known plant-specific glycan structure. The glycans will be first cleaved from the protein and analyzed independently to determine glycan structure. Next, glycopeptide fragments will be generated and analyzed to provide information about site-specific glycosylation patterns. Knowledge of the glycan structures and site occupancy will later be used to further understanding of plant glycosylation patterns and to enable in vitro glycan humanization of the plant-made BuChE.

949,"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Stephen Link of William March Rice University to study chiral plasmonics on the single nanoparticle and potentially single molecule scale. Chiral objects cannot be overlaid with their mirror image. An everyday example of this is human hands- a right handed glove doesn't fit on the left hand.  Therefore, the chirality of an object is sometimes termed its handedness. Many important molecules are chiral, including drugs, proteins, and DNA.  In the case of pharmaceuticals, the chirality of the drug is absolutely essential to its function.  Molecular chirality is measured by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Stephan Link, at Rice University, is developing novel highly sensitive methods to measure the chirality of single molecules.  The applications of this work include biomedical research, the pharmaceutical industry, and chemical synthesis and catalysis. The excitement about scientific research and discovery in nanotechnology is communicated through outreach activities such as Rice University's Civic Scientist Program to K-12 students to inspire them to pursue careers in science-related fields.     The objectives of this proposal are to be accomplished using unique spectroscopic methods capable of recording CD spectra of single plasmonic nanoparticles and super-resolution imaging single molecules, in combination with electron microscopy and electromagnetic simulations. The relationship between CD signal enhancement and nanostructure composition and morphology (size, shape, interparticle coupling) and the intrinsically linked plasmon modes (bright, dark) is possible with the proposed studies. This information cannot be obtained in ensemble measurements, especially for strongly coupled nanoparticles prepared by chemical synthesis. The outcomes of these studies are expected have wide scientific impact in areas ranging from the development of chiral sensing platforms,  and of chiral catalysts to the basis of plasmon-exciton coupling. Concepts from multiple disciplines are included in this research, forming a platform for a broad educational program specifically designed for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Exciting vignettes related to scientific research and discovery in nanotechnology are to be communicated to K-12 students through outreach activities, such as Rice University's Civic Scientist Program,  to expose these students to the potential for creative advancement via careers in STEM-related fields.

951,"Plants often recruit soil microbes in order to enhance nutrient availability and absorption by an assortment of mechanisms. Nitrogen-fixing (NF) symbiosis and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis are two important examples. NF symbiosis has major growth effects on the crops that can form this relationship such as soybean, common bean, pea, peanuts, alfalfa, etc., while AM symbiosis can do the same for many crops that form this symbiosis such as maize and rice. Rice (Oryza sativa), specifically, can have a significant grain yield increase when inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi because of the enhanced nutrient uptake. This can be especially important in parts of the world that rely on this particular crop for the majority of its calories. This award supports research to investigate the role of the SYP132A gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by defining the mycorrhizal phenotype of rice SYP132A mutants.The research could ultimately shed light on a fundamental process in rice (AM symbiosis) that has the potential to greatly increase yield if optimized. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ertao Wang, an expert in AM symbiosis in rice, at the Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology in Shanghai, China.   The nitrogen-fixing (NF) symbiotic pathway in plants evolved from the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiotic pathway, and therefore the molecular mechanisms share many common elements. Protein trafficking from the plant to the bacteria during NF symbiosis has been shown to be indispensable, but protein trafficking during AM symbiosis is most likely important as well. For this proposed project, I will study the role of a syntaxin gene (SYP132A) in mycorrhizal symbiosis. This gene was previously identified to have a role in NF symbiosis in M. truncatula, namely, it specifically marks the membrane surrounding the intracellular bacteria for targeted protein delivery. I will investigate the function of SYP132A by characterizing the mycorrhizal phenotype of rice T-DNA mutant lines.

952,"Milestone achievements in crop research now enable difficult challenges to be addressed rapidly and effectively using innovative approaches. These achievements include DNA sequences and measurements of traits relevant to productivity and quality for large numbers of varieties within individual crop species, powerful computational approaches and data management tools, increasingly detailed molecular understanding of plant biology including responses to the environment, and new methods to precisely test the function of particular DNA sequences. Building on these resources and tools, this project will address the longstanding challenge of identifying DNA sequences responsible for traits that vary in a quantitative way, called  quantitative trait loci  (QTL), and making them amenable for crop improvement.  While QTL are key determinants of crop productivity, they have been exceedingly difficult to study, and very little is known about them. This project focuses on QTL for disease resistance, disease susceptibility, and tolerance to acid soils in the globally important crop species, rice. The project will isolate DNA sequences associated with high levels of these traits and test whether those sequences are responsible by moving them into rice varieties that show low trait levels and measuring the result. The project will improve understanding of crop resistance to stresses caused by pests and poor soil conditions and lead to improved crop productivity. More broadly, the project will establish effective ways to connect variation across individuals with the DNA sequences that cause that variation, which will be useful not only for plant research, but other life sciences, including medicine. The project will further benefit society by integrating its research objectives with educational activities and materials that will engage and inform the public and increase participation by members of underrepresented groups. These include a combined classroom and research experience program for small-college undergraduates, training workshops for plant biologists, multi-media educational resources to engage middle and high school students, and a project web site (www.ricediversity.org) for public access to project-related materials, publications, and data. Moreover, the project will foster the development of diverse junior personnel into independent scientistsCompilations of genomic and other genotypic as well as phenotypic and associated metadata for large numbers of rice, powerful informatics approaches and data management tools, the unprecedented ability to precisely edit plant genomes to probe gene function, and increasingly detailed molecular understanding of rice responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, together provide a foundation for this project. This project applies large-scale statistical genetics and genome editing technology to examine distinct QTL for disease resistance, disease susceptibility, and acid soil tolerance. Building on genomic and phenotypic data, computational methods, and infrastructure generated under previous NSF awards and elsewhere, including the recently released genome sequences of 3,000 rice accessions, the project will connect genotype to phenotype for each trait, using genome editing to functionally evaluate isolated genetic polymorphism in new genetic backgrounds. Co-variation will also be examined for each trait to test for genetic background effects on allele viability, and in the case of disease susceptibility and resistance, allelic variation in pathogen-targeted genes will be queried for evidence of purifying or positive selection. Findings will be used to expand the tools and the collection of genotypic and phenotypic data associated with the project, and tailor these resources for the community, while improving understanding of and the ability to enhance plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Under the outreach objectives of the project, the combined classroom and research experience program for small-college undergraduates will integrate computational and molecular biology aspects of the proposed research and include summer internships in the research laboratories at Cornell. The training workshops will focus specifically on genome editing for plant biologists, especially those from underserved and underrepresented groups; the multimedia educational resources will include stories, podcasts, and interactive web modules and will be distributed through major media outlets; the project web site (www.ricediversity.org) for scientists, the general public, and educators will provide access to project-related materials, protocols, publications, and data (data will be released on or before publication of analytical results). Finally, the development of diverse junior personnel into capable, creative, and collaborative independent scientists will be fostered by a multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary research environment.

Johnson (Brown University)ERA-CAPS Collaborators: Jörg Becker (Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Oeiras, Portugal), Frederic Berger (Gregor Mendel Institute, Vienna, Austria), Thomas Dresselhaus and Stefanie Sprunck (University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany), David Twell (University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom), Marek Mutwil (Max Plank Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Potsdam, Germany), and Jose Gutierrez-Marcos (University of Warwick, Warwick, United Kingdom)The key agricultural products derived from corn, rice, wheat, and tomato all require successful reproduction by fertilization. The ability to increase crop production in the coming years will depend on developing a better understanding of reproductive mechanisms. The goal of this project is to take what has been learned about the molecules that mediate fertilization in a model plant species (Arabidopsis) and extend this knowledge using a comparative genomic approach in seven plant species including corn, rice, and tomato. The expected findings will allow for the identification of specific mechanisms that are targeted by environmental stresses during sexual reproduction in crops and will assist in the selection of stress-resistant cultivars. The outputs of this project will provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of sexual reproduction of economically important plant species. In addition this project will provide cutting edge training in biological imaging, genetics and genomics in the context of a critical crop plant (tomato) for a diverse team of researchers that will include a post-doctoral fellow and an undergraduate researcher. Importantly, this research team will be benefit from participation in this large, multidisciplinary and international effort comprising eight laboratories from five nations.Research during the past five years has delivered tremendous new insights into gamete physiology and the mechanisms involved in fertilization in Arabidopsis. This progress has established the view that gametes are hyper-differentiated cell types with highly specific transcriptional profiles. Advances in microscopy based on fluorescent reporters and live cell imaging have also transformed research capability and provided insights into the mechanisms involved in gamete delivery, interaction and activation of seed development. Yet, the understanding of the complexity of double fertilization that characterizes flowering plants is far from complete and lacks any knowledge about the origin of mechanisms that predate double fertilization. In this project, emerging models representing key stages in plant evolution will be used to provide insight into the ancestral mechanisms of gamete differentiation and fertilization. Gene co-function networks will be identified from expression atlases for several plant species that include the liverwort Marchantia, the moss Physcomitrella and the extant basal flowering plant Amborella. These will be complemented with co-function networks from Arabidopsis and the economically important crops maize, tomato and rice and used to study the conservation of gene co-function networks governing male and female gametogenesis, pollen tube growth and fertilization mechanisms in flowering plants. Moreover, these investigations will provide novel molecular markers of fertility in crops. It is expected that this project will result in identification of fertilization factors that were lost from ancient angiosperms during the evolution of monocots (grasses) and eudicots and those which have evolved de novo in the angiosperm lineage.  All data produced will be freely and continuously shared within the consortium. Specifically, RNAseq datasets will be accessible through a consortium database as well as through publicly available data repositories.

954,"Striga is a parasitic plant that feasts through the roots of corn, sorghum, upland rice, millet, and cowpea, devastating these crops and the lives of people who depend on them in sub-Saharan Africa and other areas in the developing world.  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) notes that, while maize has the largest acreage of all field crops in Africa, the average yield (1.6 t/hectare) is less than 1/3 of that achieved per unit area elsewhere in the world. The situation is further exacerbated by widespread dispersal of Striga seeds that intermix with maize kernels and ears going to market.  This EAGER project will test a potentially novel strategy for dealing with Striga infestation using a newly identified transposon-induced (non-transgenic) mutant of maize.  This plant carries a mutation in a gene that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 (ccd8) and has been shown to produce little to no precursors for strigolactone (SL), a maize hormone that is sensed by the Striga parasite and is required as a chemo-signal for host location and germination of its own seeds. The non-transgenic nature of this new maize mutant also enhances prospects for its acceptance and use by peoples with diverse cultures. This project will test the extent to which actual interactions between maize and Striga are affected by the partially-understood roles of strigolactone in plant biology. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine the degree of resistance to Striga seed germination and host attraction offered by the ccd8 mutation, and 2) test the concept that a relatively modest yield penalty in ccd8 maize can be countered without losing Striga resistance, by breeding strategies based on hybrid vigor and naturally-occurring genetic modifiers.  If successful, this EAGER project will provide for a new strategy that could counter Striga-based yield losses that extend from 15% to 100%, thereby making maize production sustainable in Striga infested regions.

955,"The world population is projected to increase to over 9 billion people by 2050, necessitating a 70% increase in the food supply. Such a goal can only be accomplished by increasing the yields of the major crop plants, especially the cereals, whose grains meet substantial nutritional needs in the form of protein and starch for a significant portion of the world's population. Results from this research will provide new insights and innovative strategies to improve crop yields by manipulating the enzymes (proteins that facilitate chemical reactions) involved in the early steps of the production of the proteins and starch that are stored in rice grains. In addition, this project will provide state-of-the-art research training in molecular, cellular and genetic methods, especially large-scale studies of proteins (proteomics) and genes (genomics) for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, including students from a partnering minority-serving institution, California State University at Los Angeles. Products of this research will be integrated into a new website on molecular kinesis (how for example RNA and proteins move within plant cells to the sites where they function) an important topic that is poorly described in modern plant biology textbooks.Although considerable information has been generated over the years on how plant genes are controlled at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, very little is known about how RNAs are transported and localized to specific sub-compartments of the plant cell where they are translated, stored, processed or turned-over. This research will focus on the transport and localization of RNAs in developing rice endosperm with the aim of providing a comprehensive picture of the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) involved, how they are organized into multi-RBP complexes, and how RBPs that may be common factors of distinct RNA transport pathways may, nevertheless, provide the directions for targeting RNAs to particular individual pathways. This project will use genome-wide approaches to identify the role of specific RBPs in the transport and localization of RNAs to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum and their subsequent roles in translation, stability and/or RNA processing. Specific objectives will be to:  (1) categorize cytoplasmic-localized, cytoskeletal-associated RBPs into multi-protein complexes; (2) determine the composition of RNAs bound by these multi-protein complexes and identify the associated cis-sequences; and (3) determine the role of modular domains of specific RBPs that may be responsible for specifying a particular RNA transport pathway by the analysis of genetic mutations.  This information will provide an unprecedented view of the fate of RNAs and their location in the plant cell and will thereby fill a major gap in our understanding of steps in gene expression beyond transcription.

956,"The Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship supports Dr. Erendira Quintana Morales, under the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Fleisher (Rice University), to investigate how daily meals serve to express and negotiate social status by comparing food remains associated with households of varying social status in the 14th-16th century town of Songo Mnara, Tanzania. The results of this archaeological study have implications for our understanding of past social diversity and inequality and the role of everyday practices, such as daily meals, as strategies for social mobility. An innovative and significant contribution of this project is demonstrating the role of fish as both a delicacy and a staple of the daily meal, providing evidence of cases where eating fish exerts both dividing and unifying power in a society where fish are ubiquitous but often understudied. This project provides valuable opportunities to transfer research skills to undergraduate students through training and experience analyzing and recording ceramic and zooarchaeological data, from which they can develop independent research projects. Students also have the opportunity to develop leadership and communications skills by participating in a community outreach program developed out of the fellow?s research. This archaeology module is designed in partnership with a local low-income school to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in the sciences.  This research examines fish bone and ceramic fragments from a selection of households representing diverse levels of social standing to explore how variation in food consumption practices is indicative of social status. Specific measures in the analysis of fish remains, such as size, taxonomic diversity, and element distribution, are compared across the samples to reveal statistically significant patterns in fish distribution. Standard methods of ceramic analysis for the Swahili region are used to determine how vessel form, size, origin, and decoration vary across households associated with different social status. The identification of lipid traces on ceramic fragments serves to reconstruct what food was cooked in specific vessels, which is a pioneering application of this method in the study of fish consumption and in this region. Together, these three research components -- fish remains analysis, ceramic analysis, and lipid analysis -- indicate how different modes of eating and cooking were combined with different foods on a daily basis. A unique, town-level perspective emerges from the spatial patterning of daily consumption practices during the short occupation at Songo Mnara.  This research highlights how a detailed investigation of regularly consumed food, such as fish in coastal communities, reveals the social interactions and constructions of meaning associated with past daily practices that form the fabric of a society. The project has significant international collaboration, therefore it is jointly funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.

957,"Fungi are the most economically important pathogens of crops. In particular, the rice blast disease results in losses of nearly $5 billion each year worldwide. China is the epicenter of this disease, and is investing many resources to combat it. The fungus that causes this disease penetrates and colonizes rice in a precise way that is not quite understood. This project will use high resolution microscopy to examine how proteins and other molecules are dynamically organized in growing fungal cells as well as in the infection structures of the rice blast pathogen, which will provide insight into future treatments of all fungal infections. It will be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Zonghua Wang at the Fuzhou Agricultural & Forestry University in Fuzhou, Fujian, China, and will assist in developing a permanent collaboration between the host and the proposer?s institutions based on shared research goals.    Fungi, including pathogens of plants and animals, generally colonize through the production of threadlike cells that grow at their tips, and are excellent models of cell growth. In recent years, genetic and live-cell microscopy techniques have converged to allow careful measurements of the movement of subcellular components. This project will bridge basic cell biology and molecular plant pathology to view the flow of proteins and lipids in fungal cells. Specifically, it is known that at least two separate secretory pathways exist that support fungal growth and pathogenicity, and to examine the differential dynamics of these pathways, photobleaching experiments will be performed on representative proteins from each route. Additionally, a specific lipid known to be involved in growth and development of fungi will be tracked, using a fluorescent marker, in infection structures of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, to further previous research indicating that the distribution of this lipid may be crucial for the infection process of this organism.

958,"PI: Cankui Zhang (Purdue University)CoPIs: Yona Baguma (National Agricultural Research Organization, Uganda) and Henry Wagaba (National Crops Resources Research Institute, Uganda)Anthropogenic emissions of gaseous nitrogen (N) have become a severe problem worldwide. Although much is known about the alteration of physiology and growth of plants exposed to pollutant gases, most of these studies are observational, from an ecological perspective, and do not address the possibility of using gaseous nitrogen to augment plant growth. If successful, this EAGER project will harness and exploit known molecular mechanisms of uptake and transport of soil N to facilitate these processes for airborne N. The results generated from this exploratory and high risk research may also point the way to similar strategies for N use in other species and for other important gaseous pollutants. This project will foster intellectual and technical exchange in U.S. and Africa in the area of molecular plant physiology to develop novel strategies for  pollutant  utilization in important crop species such as cassava, rice and potato. Certain air pollutants, including ammonia and nitrogen dioxide, are absorbed by leaves and are potential sources of nitrogen (N) needed for plant growth. However, plants did not evolve to take up these compounds from the air, and even if the nutrients are absorbed they may not be utilized correctly. Indeed, it has been noted primarily by ecophysiologists and forest biologists that these aerial nutrients stimulate shoot growth under certain conditions. However, it is also the case that the newly formed organic compounds are not transported out of the leaves, sequestering not only the absorbed N, but much of the carbon (C) derived from photosynthesis. As a result, root growth is inhibited, leaving the plants susceptible to drought and other stresses. In addition, the edible parts of crop plants, including tubers, do not benefit from nutrients if they stagnate in the leaves. To address this challenge, this EAGER project will develop and test novel molecular strategies for increasing the absorption and transport of aerial-derived nitrogenous compounds in potato, cassava and rice using select candidate genes identified in model plants such as Arabidopsis. All data and resources developed in this project will be available to the public.

961,"This project is supported under the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program, which is an NSF-wide program although each Directorate administers its own REU Site competition. This program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in an effort to introduce them to scientific research so as to encourage their continued engagement in the nation's scientific research and development enterprise. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose. The REU program is a major contributor to the NSF's goal of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce. The Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) sciences Directorate awarded this REU Site grant to the University of California-Los Angeles in order to enhance undergraduate experience in scientific methods and analyses in a long-term research project at the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ifugao, Philippines. Students in this REU program are actively involved in investigating highland economic and political responses to the arrival of the Spanish in the northern Philippines. As an REU Site, the project recruits junior- and senior-level undergraduates from a wide-range of backgrounds, home institutions, ages, gender, and ethnicity, with emphasis on under-represented and female students. The PI-team strives to focus the recruitment on minority-serving institutions, including community colleges, by utilizing the institutional connections of the UCLA Academic Advancement Program-Center for Community College Partnerships. Students participating in the project are actively involved in the research design, data collection, and laboratory analysis of archaeologically retrieved materials. Students receive intensive training in archaeological field methods, faunal and botanical analyses, human osteology, and, artifact identification and cataloguing. Through the collaboration between UCLA (lead institution), University of Washington, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Philippines, the National Museum of the Philippines, and the Save the Ifugao Terraces Movement, Inc., students in this REU Site program receive intensive mentorship during and after the program.Although the Spanish failed to colonize the northern Philippine highlands, preliminary analysis of the archaeological record from Ifugao suggests drastic landscape and social transformations ensued after c. AD 1600. To determine the impacts of Spanish colonialism in highland Philippines, this research program conducts subsurface excavations, spatial modeling, and analyses of faunal and paleobotanical samples, artifacts, and human osteolical remains. The research program investigates the political and economic impacts of Spanish colonialism in highland Philippines, particularly, in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ifugao, Philippines, where the most extensive rice terraces in the world are located. Previous models suggest that the rice terraces are at least 2,000 years old. Recent archaeological information, however, indicates that the agricultural marvels were constructed after the arrival of the Spanish in the northern Philippines at c. AD 1600. In addition, rapid social and environmental change occurred in the region shortly after AD 1600. This research provides another perspective to our understanding of Spanish colonialism, which has largely focused on the Americas. The Ifugao rice terraces are rapidly deteriorating and the Ifugao people are losing both their tangible and intangible heritage to changes brought about by economic and political transformations. The rice terraces are examples of landesque and the assimilation of Ifugao social organization to that of the state together with the low status given to farmers and the rapid disappearance of traditional knowledge could further spell degradation of the terraces. One of the overarching goals of this study is to contribute to heritage conservation programs in Ifugao, in both tangible and intangible heritage. As such, this REU Site engages the community by promoting direct and active participation of descendant communities. The project also helps with the establishment of a community museum and on-site museum to complement the development of indigenous culture and history curriculum.

962,"PI: Venkatesan Sundaresan (University of California-Davis)CoPIs: Jonathan Eisen and David Mackill (University of California-Davis), and Merle Anders (University of Arkansas-Fayetteville)Collaborator: James Garner (University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff)Plants grow in close association with large communities of microbes called microbiomes, that influence nutrient composition and uptake of nutrients in the soil, as well as disease susceptibility. Major advances in understanding the health  effects of human microbiomes have resulted from using gnotobiotic animal systems, in which germ-free animals are exposed to defined microbiomes to study their effects. Gnotobiotic systems to study microbiome function in plants are harder to implement because plant microbiomes are a combination of internal and external (e.g. soil) components.  This project will use a gnotobiotic system developed for rice plants, in which root-associated microbiomes from different sources or conditions can be transplanted, and established in plants grown under controlled conditions.  The project will enable the discovery of specific functions of plant microbiomes at the molecular level, and the evaluation of the impact of microbiomes on plant performance.  Understanding the interactions of the host plant with its microbiome, and subsequent effects on crop performance and yields, provides possibilities for exploiting plant-microbe associations for future crop improvement. A second aim of the project addresses the concern that agriculture is a major source of global emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Rice cultivation worldwide is estimated to contribute nearly half of these emissions by promoting the growth of methane producing microbes. The project will examine the effects of different rice varieties on methane producing microbes, as well as methane consuming microbes, found in rice root-associated microbiomes.  The findings can lead to strategies for reducing methane emissions from paddy fields, and reduce the impacts of rice cultivation on climate change. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, the project will provide summer research internships for selected undergraduate students from University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, a Historically Black University.The project will use genomic approaches to understand the impact of microbial associations on the crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). Preliminary data show that root microbiomes of soil grown rice plants are modulated by several environmental factors, including soil type, cultivation practice and drought, suggesting that changes to microbiomes constitute part of the plant adaptation to the environment. The growth preference of rice for semi-aquatic substrates has been exploited to establish a gnotobiotic rice model, such that plants grown under controlled conditions can acquire a defined microbiome.  In this project, microbiomes used for transplantation will be characterized by 16SrDNA sequencing to identify the constituent taxa, and the transcriptomes of the treated rice plants will be studied using RNAseq.  The transcriptional responses of gnotobiotic rice plants with transplanted microbiomes from different sources and stress treatments, including drought stress, will be analyzed for global changes in gene expression, as well as specific functional classes of genes that might reflect adaptive responses by the plant induced by the microbiome. Lastly, the association of archaea with cultivated rice, a significant contribution to planetary methane emissions, and potentially to climate change, will be investigated.  Specifically, the effects of genotype on methanogenic archaea and methanotrophic bacteria, as well as computationally identified associated microbial networks in field grown rice, will be characterized, towards the goal of breeding low emission rice. Plant transcriptomic and microbial sequence data generated by the project will be released through public databases that include the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA), respectively.

963,"Developing Students as Scientists: Redesigning the Undergraduate Experience through Early and Continued Research ExperiencesThe purpose of this grantis to enhance recruitment and retention of underrepresented undergraduates in STEM/STEAM fields at Texas Lutheran University (TLU), led by Dr. Alison Bray,and to enhance food safety by exploring how growing methods affect the amount of arsenic uptake by rice, in collaboration with Dr. Michael Grusak at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service Children&#39;s Nutrition Research Center (USDA-ARS-CNRC) in Houston.The educational component of this project will improve recruitment and retention of students in STEM/STEAM fields through early intervention by training students in research and problem solving at the beginning of their undergraduate education. This component will be coupled with a concerted effort to keep students involved in research programs throughout their time at TLU. Students who participate in this program will have an enriched background in laboratory science, allowing easier transition into research projects and ultimately into careers in STEAM fields. In collaboration with the USDA, TLU willhighlight agricultural science in chemistry education, expanding the range of opportunities for future graduates.High school students, specifically those from Seguin and Navarro high schools (both with large numbers of traditionally underrepresented populations) and 6th grade students from Navarro will also be impacted through the planned outreach activities. These experiences will inform students about science careers in agriculture, strengthen their understanding about scientific methods, and, through interactions with TLU college students, visualize a college science degree as a personal and realistic option.The scientific research aspect of this project will focus on ways to minimize the contamination of edible plants by toxic metals/metalloids. Previous research at TLU examined the concentration of arsenic in baby food products, specifically those containing rice and brown rice syrup (Matthys et al., 2013). This research stems from multiple previous studies that show elevated concentrations of arsenic in edible rice and rice products (e.g. Meharg et al., 2008). As infants have an increased sensitivity to toxic metal ingestion and rice is a common  first food  for infants, we would like to expand this research to better understand the uptake mechanisms of arsenic and toxic metals/metalloids into plants, especially rice. In collaboration with Dr. Michael Grusak at the USDA-ARS-CNRC in Houston, TX, we plan to explore how crop production methods (field flooding and drainage) affect the amount of arsenic taken up by rice.It has been proposed that the total arsenic uptake by rice plants can be minimized by using periodic cycles of soil drying in rice fields (Li et al., 2009). This reduction in total arsenic uptake could result in lower arsenic accumulation in grains. These critical investigations can be carried out by undergraduates with bench-scale studies in the TLU Greenhouse.Given that Texas is in the top five of rice-producing states, this research has potential for local and worldwide impact on farming practices.Dr. Alison Bray is an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at TLU. Dr. Bray arrived at TLU in the spring of 2011. Dr. Bray was awarded an E. Kika De La Garza Fellowship from the USDA in the summer of 2014 which allowed her to develop a much deeper understanding of the USDA missions. As part of the fellowship, Dr. Bray spent 2 weeks at the USDA-ARS-CNRC in Houston, Texas working with Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Bray is deeply involved in education outreach programs for science in the community and coordinates outreach efforts through her supervision of the TLU Pi Rho Chemistry club.About TLUFounded in 1891, TLU is an undergraduate university of the liberal arts, sciences and professional studies located in Seguin, Texas.

965,"Nationwide, estimated sales from hydroponic crops in 2012 were $10,491,871, up from $3,306,138 in 2007 (NASS, 2012). Non-recirculating hydroponic systems (NRHS), which uses soilless root-support substrates (SRSS), are more popular than nutrient recirculating systems like the Nutrient Film Technique. This project aims to develop improved hydroponic production practices to mitigate environmental pollution from nitrate and phosphorus in NRHS through runoff leachates, while sustaining the high yield and quality potential of hydroponically grown crops. In addition, it will improve the economic wellbeing of hydroponic producers by (1) increasing the long-term viability and sustainability of the small-scale hydroponic industry in Missouri, (2) increase fertilizer-use efficiency (profitability), and (3) enhance better compliance with Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s &#39;maximum contaminant level (MCL).

967,"Organic rice production has steadily increased in the U.S. over the last 20 years, with a majority of acreage being grown in the southern region. In contrast, conventional rice acreage has been declining. Farmers are seeking new ways to capture value-added markets like organic rice to sustain farming and their rural communities. Disease, weed and insect pests are among the primary factors threatening the expansion of the organic rice industry. We use an interdisciplinary approach that will help strengthen the foundations of organic rice production and aim at developing sustainable and profitable management strategies to minimize the losses caused by these pests. We will: 1) develop brassica biofumigation cover cropping system that reduces these pests; 2) develop improved cultivars/lines for organic systems that are of high yielding potential and resistant/tolerant to these pests; 3) identify effective seed treatment tools to reduce diseases and weeds and improve stand that include a high level of seeding rate and seed treatments with gibberellic acid and biocontrol agents; 4) identify profitable pest management strategies using partial budget analysis and develop interactive budgets that help producers manage input costs and increase economic returns; and 5) create a multistate outreach and extension program including stakeholder advisory board, on-farm demonstrations, and multiple dissemination means of information.

968,"Whole grain brown rice, rice bran, and dry beans are inexpensive, healthy staple foods with low U.S. consumption. Numerous evidences exist for promoting increased consumption of brown rice and dry beans for chronic disease prevention , yet prospective evaluation of health outcomes remains difficult due to lack of reliable dietary intake biomarkers. Our completed, short-term feeding studies with fixed amounts of rice bran and navy beans in children with elevated cholesterol and adult colorectal cancer survivors provide a novel opportunity for assessing dietary biomarkers of intake. Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein. These studies will set the foundation for evaluating Rice Bran (RB) and Navy Beans (NB) intake to other important diet-disease relationships.

Significantly, they also regulate root architecture in monocots such as rice, root growth and architecture being of critical importance for the ability of the plant to acquire water and nutrients. The main goal of this project is to determine the role cytokinin plays in controlling the root system architecture. This goal will be accomplished through examining the role that a key family of cytokinin-regulated transcription factors play in controlling root growth. Mutants in these transcription factors will be examined for their effects on the root architecture. In addition, the direct targets for these transcription factors will be determined, as these are likely play a key role in the means by which cytokinin regulates that root system architecture.

970,"Plant diseases adversly affect food security, and in turn can destroythe economy on a national and global scale. Thus it is critical for scientists to determine novel ways to combat plant diseases.Like humans, plants have immune systems to ward off disease.Rice is a staple crop for more than half the world, and so it is important to study it&#39;s immune system such that scientists can find ways to prevent certain diseases from adversely affecting rice yield. Bacterial blightdisease of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection, results in epidemicsin many parts of the world. About 50 years ago, plant breeders identified a variety of rice in Africa that is naturally resistant to bacterial blight disease. In 1995, the Ronald lab identified the protein that confers robust and broad-spectrum resistance to Xoo in rice, called XA21(Xanthomonas resistance 21). Although XA21 was identified over 20 years ago, the mechanism by which XA21 confersimmunity is still largely unknown. Studies aimed at elucidating the gene network involved inXa21-mediated immunity can help in understanding rice innate immunity. Here I propose to study genes that are important for the plant immune response but have not been yet been examined or characterized in any plant species. In my first objective, I used a novel computational prediction tool to identify three genes that are likely to be involved in the Xa21-mediated immune response. I then generated transgenic plants that are silenced for the three genes, in plants that are resistant to Xoo infection since they contain XA21. If these plants that are silenced for the three genes demonstrate altered in resistance to Xoo infection, compared to XA21-containing plants that are not silenced for the three genes, then the three genes are involved in Xa21-mediated immunity. In my second objective, I will study an XA21 containing rice plant that lost resistance to bacterial blight disease becuase the plant has a large genetic deletion region in the genome. I hypothesize that one gene in the deletion region is responsible for the loss of resistance to bacterial blight disease in the mutant. The novelty of studying these genes is particularly exciting, and my results will be made broadly available, allowing for generation of novel hypotheses and biotechnological applications. This work is particularly importantbecause it is crucial to understand disease process in cereals as they produce most food in the world. Rice is a great model for cereals with immediate applications, and pathways controlling innate immune responses in rice are similar to those in other plants and animals, so the expected results will be relevant to other species.

971,"Worldwide, arsenic frequently contaminates rice, presenting a risk to food safety. Additions of silicon have shown promise in reducing uptake of arsenite, but reducing uptake of organic arsenic is less studied. Uptake of organic arsenic compounds may also cause straight-head disease in rice, thereby lowering yields. The overall goal of this research is to develop agronomic techniques for reducing rice uptake of organic arsenic compounds, particularly monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Towards this goal, the project will investigate the following three factors&#39; ability to limit rice uptake of organic arsenic: silicon amendments, organic acid amendments, and nitrogen source. Amendments successful in reducing uptake of DMA and MMA in hydroponic studies will be tested in field trials to improve the nation&#39;s food safety via reduced risk to consumers. This project also includes several career development and mentorship aspects, including the co-development of a plant-contaminant interactions course, mentorship of students, attending career development workshops, and learning of new analytical skills. My mentor, Dr. Seyfferth, will be an invaluable asset due to her experience with uptake of inorganic contaminants by agronomic crops.

972,"The proposal  Mechanisms of Cold Stress Tolerance Responses in Rice  is submitted by Program Director (PD) Michael Schl&auml;ppi from Marquette University and co-PD Georgia Eizenga from the USDA-ARS, and fits the A1101 program area  Plant Growth and Development, Composition and Stress Tolerance . Rice (Oryza sativa) yield would be enhanced if growers could plant two weeks earlier in the season to better utilize the spring rain and avoid the high nighttime temperatures of mid-summer, which decrease grain quality and yield. Our objective is to use two diverse and well-characterized rice collections, the USDA Rice Mini-Core (RMC) consisting of 203 accessions, and Rice Diversity Panel 1 (RDP1) composed of 420 accessions, to provide a better understanding of the basic genetic and cellular mechanisms responsible for tolerance to cold temperatures at germination and the seedling stage in rice. To accomplish this, we will (i) validate cold tolerance phenotypes of the RMC in field experiments; (ii) test hypotheses for mechanisms of rice cold tolerance by examining membrane damage, levels of antioxidants and enzymes, and photoperiod response to cold in the RMC, and by conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS); (iii) fine-map some of the previously identified 37 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for cold tolerance using two bi-parental mapping populations genotyped with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS); (iv) identify putative candidate genes associated with cold tolerance using SNP based linkage disequilibrium (LD) data, gene expression profiles, and public databases; and (v) validate selected candidate genes in transgenic plants with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and by overexpression approaches. This information will be the basis for gene discovery, and ultimately, will identify cold-associated DNA markers and rice germplasm with improved seedling vigor early in the growing season for use in variety improvement programs.

973,"In animals, G proteins are activated by 7-transmembrane (7TM) cell surface receptors that cause the coupled G protein complex to exchange bound GDP for GTP (on). This induces a dissociation of the complex into  active  Ga subunit and Gbg dimer. Signaling is accelerated back to the resting state (off) by cytoplasmic Regulators of G Signaling (RGS) proteins though accelerated hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP (see figure, left). In plants, including cereals, the activation step (GDP release) is spontaneous and therefore does not use a GPCR. Rather, an extracellular signal controls the deactivation step through a unique 7TM RGS protein, except in cereals. Thus it is unknown how rice G proteins are activated. Given these unique properties of rice G cycling, a previously-unknown mechanism for G protein activation for eukaryotes in general and for crop cereals in particular will be discovered upon completion of this project. Besides discovery of a novel mechanism for activation, this project will translate to improvements in US agriculture because important agronomic traits such as shoot and root architecture, drought and salt tolerance, and disease resistance are controlled through rice G protein activation. The aims are: Aim 1) Identify the endogenous rice regulator of G activation in a discovery-driven approach. Aim 2) engineer synthetic control of rice G cycling using a heterologous and a synthetic RGS protein in a hypothesis-driven approach. If we are successful reaching these two aims, then we will be in position to design a system to alter rice traits in the field when necessitated by a local change in condition.

974,"Yields of staple crops need to increase by 60% to feed 9 billion people worldwide by 2050. This challenging goal is further complicated by growing competition for land, water and energy, as well as by the potential negative impacts of climate change on crop productivity. Therefore, continued and dedicated research efforts are essential to increase yields and to expand the range of locations and environments where these crops can be grown productively.One of the most critical factors underlying grain crop productivity is a precise timing of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. For example, in environments with hot summers, early-flowering photoperiod insensitive wheat varieties mature prior to the onset of damaging high temperatures and show significantly higher yields than photoperiod-sensitive later-flowering varieties (&gt;35% in Southern Europe). By contrast, photoperiod sensitive wheat varieties show yield advantages in milder climates, as their delayed flowering extends the period of vegetative growth providing more resources for biomass and grain production. Similarly, late-flowering forage and energy sorghums show increased biomass, whereas grain sorghums are selected for early flowering to ensure sufficient time for grain maturation while avoiding drought. This proposal is focused on improving our understanding of the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in the grass family to assist breeders in selecting better adapted crops with improved yield and wider production environments.A critical factor underlying crop productivity is a precise adjustment of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. In wheat and sorghum this adjustment is regulated mainly by the PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), a gene that accounts for most natural variation in photoperiodic response in several economically important grass species. In spite of its central role, it is still not known how PRR37 promotes flowering in wheat but represses flowering in sorghum under long days. The first objective of this proposal is to determine the cause of the reverse activity of PRR37 in short-day (sorghum) and long-day (wheat) grasses using transgenic approaches to exchange critical photoperiod genes between the two species. The second objective is to understand the interactions between the different photoperiod genes. Populations segregating simultaneously for the different genes will be used to determine their interdependencies in the regulation of flowering genes and heading time. The final objective is to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms involved in the differential activity of PRR37 in the regulation of its downstream targets by analyzing PRR37 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.A precise understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in wheat and sorghum can have a significant impact on the development of novel varieties better adapted to a wider range of environments. In addition, the understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in crops as diverse as sorghum and wheat will also enable the translation of this knowledge to other economically-important crops, including both short day (e.g. rice) and long day species (e.g. barley).

975,"This project involves the study of a disease called Victoria blight which was originally identified on the host plant, oats. The disease is caused by the fungus, Cochliobolus victoriae which can only infect oats if it makes a peptide called  victorin  and interacts with oats carrying a gene called  Vb . Various analyses suggest that the Vb gene, which confers Victoria blight susceptibility and sensitivity to victorin, is identical to a gene called Pc2 which confers resistance to a different disease called  crown rust of oats  caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata. Consistent with this interpretation, molecular analyses reveal that victorin activates a resistance protein (NB-LRR) which leads to cell death and that C. victoriae exploits this defense response to cause disease. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that victorin sensitivity is conditioned by genes encoding resistance proteins across diverse crop species including barley, rice and bean. We hypothesize that these resistance proteins (NB-LRRs) are functionally, and perhaps structurally, related to the protein encoded by the Vb/Pc2 gene in oats. This proposal will address this hypothesis and in addition investigates the diversity of targets for victorin and the resistance proteins activated.

976,"According to the latest information from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines, rice is consumed by roughly three and a half of the world&#39;s seven billion people. Unfortunately, IRRI also discovered that farmers, on average, lose 37% of their rice yield to diseases and pests, per year. One of the most devastating diseases of rice that occurs on a global scale is caused by a fungus named Magnaporthe oryzae, and causes rice blast disease. Every year, rice blast kills enough rice to feed sixty million people. Methods to combat this fungus include utilizing genes for resistance that naturally occur in different rice isolates, as well as fungicides. While these methods have some efficacy, they are not long-lived. Once these selection pressures are placed upon the fungal populations in the fields, the fungus must adapt to the resistant rice lines or fungicides, or it will die. There are many documented cases of the fungus adapting to the new environment, and effectively  overcoming  either the rice resistance gene, or the fungicide. In fact, others&#39; research has demonstrated that it takes roughly three years for the fungus to overcome a new rice resistance gene once it has been deployed in the field. Plants have two types of main resistance mechanisms; they have a very strong, very effective resistance called  R-gene  mediated resistance, and they have a slower and weaker resistance called  basal  resistance. The problem with the former type of resistance was described above. Such a strong type of resistance forces the fungus to switch up its genes, and adapt to its new environment. A new R-gene resistant cultivar of rice can look great one season, but then the next season, it can become totally decimated by the  evolved  fungus in the field. Recently, pathologists are digging more deeply into basal resistance. Plants are constantly being challenged with microbes and pests; while most of them will be non-pathogens on the plant, some will gain entrance and start to attack. Basal resistance limits the spread of these pathogens, so that either the plant can grow enough to reproduce, or at least not succumb to disease immediately.Both types of resistances involve plant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Just as in humans, ROS are a double-edged sword for plants. They are necessary for proper development, however in excess, they can have deleterious effects, or even be directly toxic. We are studying the role of ROS in the rice-rice blast fungus interaction, in order to determine whether certain secretions from the fungus are actually triggering the ROS part of the basal resistance. We have some preliminary data that indicates, yes, the fungus has certain pathways that activate, and actually trigger the rice plant&#39;s basal resistance. Indeed, when these pathways in the fungus are disrupted, the rice basal response is even stronger, and the pathogen causes less disease. This is a great thing! Our goal is to identify more such pathways in the fungus, in order to determine all the signals that regulate the rice plant&#39;s basal resistance. And from the rice side, we will examine the rice genes that respond specifically to these fungal signals. We are using  high-throughput  technologies to examine as many genes and signals in both the plant and the fungus, at the same time. This method is both comprehensive and time-efficient. Ultimately, if we can ascertain the fungal signals that turn up the plant&#39;s basal resistance, as well as all the genes involved in this response, then we might be able to breed rice lines that are primed to respond to fungal attack with a stronger basal resistance response. This type of resistance, typically governed by numerous genes in the plant, is much harder for the fungus to adapt to, and would therefore provide durable, long-lasting resistance in the field.

977,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the staple food for over half of the world&#39;s population, and there is a critical need to simultaneously increase micronutrient and decrease toxic elemental concentrations in rice grains to meet global food security demands. Rice quality and yield are impacted by arsenic (As) uptake and storage in grains, and plant availability of As is intimately linked to iron (Fe) cycling in soils. In addition, concentrations of micronutrients such as Fe are lost during grain processing. We propose that bacterial inoculants could be used to simultaneously increase Fe and decrease As concentrations in rice, and we have identified a novel, nonpathogenic, naturally-occurring rice-rhizospheric bacterial candidate for this purpose. The successful outcome of our proposed research will provide fundamental insight into the role of diverse microbial communities on plant health. A comprehensive understanding of the effects of the soil rhizobacteria on crop plants will enable the development of agricultural technologies that exploit the natural alliances among microbes and plants, and provide new avenues to increase yields.

978,"Corn (maize, Zea mays) is our nation&#39;s most extensively grown crop in terms of acreage planted. It is also by far the highest yielding of all the grain crops (e.g., compare U.S. average 160 bu./acre for maize versus soybeans, 43 bu./acre, and wheat, 46 bu./acre). The higher yield potential of maize is attributable to a specialized photosynthesis process, termed C4 photosynthesis, that maize leaves use for fixing CO2 into carbohydrate. In contrast, all the other major grain crops, with the exception of Sorghum, rely on a more widely occurring photosynthesis process termed  C3  photosynthesis. The difference between C3 and C4 photosynthesis in terms of productivity (i.e., carbohydrate synthesized per unit of absorbed sunlight) is striking. By using C4 photosynthesis, maize leaves can synthesize twice the amount of carbohydrate from assimilated CO2 versus grain crops that utilize C3 photosynthesis. Because of the huge productivity advantage conferred by C4 photosynthesis several consortiums of plant scientists world-wide are now organized with the expressed aim of engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species such as rice. Recent studies estimate that a  C4  rice would yield up to 60% more grain than present day C3 rice cultivars. To enable the introduction of this powerful photosynthetic engine into C3 crop species, a comprehensive understanding of how C4 photosynthesis is biochemically regulated in leaves will need to be gained. This research project will expand our knowledge in this area by elucidating how a newly discovered enzyme in maize leaves called pyruvate phosphate dikinase isoform 2 (PDRP2) biochemically regulates the C4 photosynthesis enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Our working hypothesis is that PDRP2 functions to biochemically inactivate PPDK enzyme that inadvertently accumulates in a specialized leaf cell called bundle sheath (BS) cell. According to current models of C4 photosynthesis, the presence of any PPDK in the BS cells would result in a short circuiting of the photosynthetic process. We propose that PDRP2 prevents such a short circuit from ever developing by ensuring that any PPDK that appears in this cell type will be rendered catalytically dead. This hypothesis will be experimentally examined using principally immunological (antibody dependent) methods. These methods include high resolution western blotting and confocal microscopy. In parallel to these experiments, an in-depth investigation into the biochemical properties of PDRP2 will be conducted to better understand the mechanism of how PDRP2 catalyzes biochemical regulation of PPDK. In all, this project will contribute essential knowledge to those efforts aimed at engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species.

979,"Thiamin deficiencies impact populations in both developed and developing countries. In many cases, fortifying staple refined foods with thiamin can mitigate the deficiencies. To optimize the delivery of thiamin, it must be stable in the product throughout storage and use. Current US consumer demands (and therefore industry trends) include increasing both whole-grain (whole-food) and gluten-free products. More information is needed to document the impact of thiamin ingredient form, food matrix, and processing and storage conditions on the stability of thiamin throughout shelf-life in a variety of food products beyond refined and enriched wheat-based foods. The proposed study will document the magnitude of thiamin losses through production and storage scenarios, encompassing a variety of thiamin ingredient forms, model systems, staple refined foods (based on wheat, corn, and rice), and food products (including gluten-free). Not only will this information be useful to compare thiamin stability in whole and fortified foods made from staple crops throughout the world, but it will also be useful to support thiamin-containing gluten-free product development efforts. The ultimate goal is to improve the delivery of thiamin in a variety of foods to promote a safe (interpret this as gluten-free for Celiac patients), sufficient, and nutritious food supply for both developed and developing nations. This project will address the USDA program area priority in Program Area A1361  Improving Food Quality  by comprehensively investigating thiamin stability in natural and synthetic ingredients and whole and fortified foods and then developing recommendations to stabilize and optimize the delivery of thiamin in both ingredients and foods. While research on thiamin stability is available in the literature, we believe that ours is a novel approach, combining an applied characterization of thiamin content and stability in foods and ingredients, including investigations of gluten-free products, with a fundamental extension of the latest in scientific advances on solid state architecture from the pharmaceutical arena to whole food applications. In particular, our proposed research has the following novel features: 1) A systematic investigation of natural and synthetic as well as crystalline and amorphous thiamin structures; 2) Development of a mechanistic understanding of how common food ingredients (starch, proteins, and gums) disrupt the molecular assembly of thiamin additives, resulting in amorphous structures with altered physical and chemical stability; 3) A direct comparison of the stability of natural and synthetic thiamin forms in food and model systems across relevant production and storage scenarios; and 4) An understanding of the synergistic or antagonistic formulation/process/environmental interactions on the kinetics of thiamin degradation through processing and storage of foods. The Specific Objectives are designed to enhance the fundamental understanding of the impacts of vitamin form, formulation, solid state properties, and storage treatment interactions on thiamin stability and to develop recommendations for improving the stability of thiamin in foods. The Potential Impact and Expected Outcomes of the fundamental new knowledge we will generate in manipulating thiamin ingredients in crystalline forms and amorphous dispersions include the development of recommendations and implementation of solid state strategies to enhance thiamin additive stability in both ingredients and foods. Scientifically sound recommendations developed from this work will enable selection of the optimal form of thiamin for different products, with the potential to improve delivery of thiamin in a wide variety of products and ultimately reduce rates of thiamin deficiencies in both developed and developing countries.

980,"My lab focuses on signal transduction pathways that are controlled by a family of plant-specific small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases), termed ROPs. ROPs act as master switches that turn on or off signaling pathways by cycling between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound form. ROPs are turned on by specific upstream signaling molecules such as RopGEFs (Rop guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and RopGEF-interacting proteins, RLKs (receptor-like protein kinases), which perceive extracellular input signals. Activated ROPs then activate effector proteins such as RICs and RIPs/ICRs to generate specific outputs (i.e., responses to the input signal). We have demonstrated that ROPs are universal and versatile signaling switches in plants, controlling many agriculturally important plant processes, e.g., disease resistance, tolerance to various abiotic stresses such as low oxygen, drought and nutrient imbalance, pollination, development of roots and root hairs, leaf morphogenesis, and responses to plant growth hormones such as auxin and ABA. Our results suggest that each of these processes is controlled by a specific ROP signaling pathway or network that is composed functionally distinct members of the RopGEF and RIC family. Our goals are: 1) to determine which member(s) of the RIC and RopGEF gene family controls each of the ROP-dependent pathways; 2) to elucidate a ROP-dependent signaling network that regulates nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and the mechanism by which this signaling network regulates NUE, which is of significant agricultural importance; 3) to alter and engineer these ROP, RIC and RopGEF genes in order to develop new crop cultivars with improved productivity and quality.Toward achieving these long-term goals, we need to investigate the function of each RIC and RopGEF gene and to elucidate various ROP signaling pathways. We use the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana, a species in the Brassicaceae family (the cabbage family) that include many important crop species, and rice, the model crop for monocot species including cereals. Our transgenic studies have shown that Arabidopsis ROP genes or their mutant genes show identical functions in other crop species such as tobacco and rice as in Arabidopsis. Thus we anticipate that Arabidopsis genes investigated can be directly used for crop improvement and will conduct proof of concepts for application of our genes in crop improvement. We are particularly interested in using ROP signaling genes to ultimately improve crops important to California, such as grapes.

981,"The emergence of a global economy and traditional horticultural crop competition have influenced Southern University Agricultural Research and Extension Center (SUAREC) to undertake research on alternative niche market crops to enhance economic viability of small and limited resource farms served by SUAREC. The medicinal mushroom, Cordyceps species, is a potential niche market crop for enterprise development due to its demand by health-conscious populace, premium-price in international market and medicinal and anti-inflammation properties. The success in developing cultivation methods and the ease of submerged culture cultivation and low production cost make this mushroom feasible for small farm production. The goal of this project is to develop unique and quality Cordyceps mycelia and fruit bodies for high-end markets using crawfish meat and brown rice medium..

982,"Fungal plant pathogens are a major annual cause of crop damage and loss throughout the world and consequently pose a serious threat to global food supply and security 18. Despite the use of disease-resistant varieties and fungicide applications, many common fungal pathogens continue to cause widespread damage to important global crop species, including rice (Magnaporthe oryzae), and cereals (Fusarium graminearum)18. Inevitably, pathogens evolve resistance to fungicides and overcome disease-resistant cultivars7. Thus, additional treatment options, including novel anti-fungal targets are constantly needed to limit crop damage from fungal pathogens. In a recent ranking of the top 10 scientifically and economically important fungal plant pathogens by the journal Molecular Plant Pathology, Magnaporthe oryzae and Fusarium graminearum were ranked first and fourth, respectively7.Cdc14 is an attractive target for anti-fungal drug development for several important reasons. First, genetic deletion of CDC14 severely retards growth and eliminates pathogenicity of F. graminearum and M. oryzae, based on results from our Purdue collaborator, Dr. Jin-Rong Xu. Second, unlike most serine/threonine phosphatases, Cdc14 is a single subunit enzyme whose substrate selectivity appears to be entirely dictated by the structure around its catalytic site, suggesting that design of highly specific competitive inhibitors should be achievable. Third, CDC14 phosphatase genes are conserved in fungi and animals, but are absent from higher plants11. Thus, plants are likely to be unaffected by compounds that specifically inhibit Cdc14. The proposed work will address the problem of crop fungal pathogens by understanding the physiological importance of a protein required for plant infection and by developing inhibitors to test the viability of this protein as a novel anti-fungal drug target.The potential outcomes and benefits to society are the future development of new anti-fungal compounds for treating or preventing plant fungal infections that cause devastating losses to crops around the world each year.

The project focus is on mechanisms and processes by which plants tolerate these extremes without substantive adverse effects on growth and development. The project will use the model system Arabidopsis for research that has inherent topic discovery value and will initiate translation to a cereal (rice) and a horticultural crop (tomato). Three recent crop examples, rice, wheat and sorghum determinants that enhance flooding, and salinity and heavy metal tolerances, have translated basic knowledge about plant responses to these environmental extremes to cultivar development. The proposed research will focus on signaling that regulates mechanisms/processes that facilitate drought and low temperature tolerance. For both, the signaling pathways appear to be at the intersection between environmental sensing and signaling, and growth and development programs. This is of interest because tolerance to environmental extremes require appropriate phenological responses for which there is less understanding but likely are linked to yield stability.

985,"Plant diseases caused by various fungal pathogens are one major threat to global food security. One group of important but under-investigated pathogens specifically infects floral tissues (non-pathogenic on leaves or stems) (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2006). Some of them can mimic pollen tubes to invade and grow inside floral tissues (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2004). Because it is too late for disease control when symptoms become visible, crop diseases caused by floral pathogens such as wheat head blight, rice false smut, and ergots often result in significant yield losses and mycotoxin contaminations. Fusarium graminearum is the causal agent of wheat head blight or scab, which is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the US. On adult plants, this pathogen specifically infects flowering wheat heads and produces a trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which is an important virulence factor (Proctor et al., 2002). The expression of TRI genes responsible for DON biosynthesis, including the TRI5 trichodiene synthase gene was detectable at early infection stages and infection cushions, which is likely trigged by plant factors. Earlier studies have indicated that certain compounds in floral tissues could stimulate fungal growth and virulence (Ngugi &amp; Scherm, 2006). Floral pathogens must be able to recognize these compounds as signals for the expression of infection-related genes. To date, no such factors that predispose floral tissues to fungal infection have been identified and confirmed by molecular studies. The proposed study aims to take advantages of recent advances in analytical technologies and molecular biology studies to identify wheat compounds in anthers that stimulate virulence in F. graminearum and fungal genes involved in the recognition and responses to these compounds. Identification of the compounds in wheat anthers that stimulate virulence and DON production will have a broader impact because F. graminearum also infects other small grains, such as barley and millets. Results from proposed experiments will provide much needed information for understanding the recognition of floral tissues by pathogens. Characterizing their biosynthesis pathoways in plants and molecular mechanisms involved in its recognition by F. graminearum can be developed in to future fundable research projects. In addition, reducing or disrupting its biosynthesis in wheat anthers can be developed as a novel disease control strategy, which is a likely practical application out of this study.

988,"Recently, agricultural commodity prices have increased, in some cases reaching record high levels. In most cases agricultural prices have become more volatile (Carter, Rausser and Smith). This project will focus on studying price and volume relationships in commodity markets in selected countries to allow policy-makers and farmers to better understand the workings of their local and international markets. The issue of agricultural trade protectionism has been well researched (Anania et. al.). Some economists believe that trade liberalization on a regional basis reduces the cost of liberalizing trade between blocs, making global liberalization easier to achieve. Others claim that regional integration reduces the motivation for liberalizing trade on a more global basis, and results in excessive trade diversion. Despite the overwhelming economic evidence of the costs of protectionism in agriculture, trade barriers remain very high, due to political economy reasons.In fact, there has been little progress in reducing distortions to agricultural trade.China is becoming a larger and larger player in food markets. In 2010, China became the largest export market for U.S. agricultural goods. Trade is expected to take on a greater importancefor China in coming years (Carter, Zhong and Zhu). Most previous studies of China&#39;s agricultural trade have focused on the grain and oilseed sector, due to China&#39;s erratic trade behavior in these bulk commodities and the potential destabilizing role of China&#39;s trade liberalization. Surprisingly, little effort has been devoted to studying China&#39;s horticultural sector, despite its global importance. With an abundant rural labor force relative to its land base, it is broadly accepted that China&#39;s agriculture has a comparative advantage in labor-intensive horticultural crops, such as fruits and vegetables (Carter) and could become a more significant player in world markets for these food products. This is one of the issues that will be addressed by this project.Trading in futures markets establishes global price levels for many important agricultural, energy and financial assets. Producers and consumers base critical economic decisions on these price signals, such as crop choice. Additionally, futures markets serve an important role as a vehicle for risk management. A significant portion of California agricultural production is devoted to commodities traded on futures markets, such as cattle, dairy products, wheat, rice, and cotton. Additionally, other California products are indirectly affected by futures market prices. Hedge and index fund futures market activity has increased dramatically over the last few years, and now accounts for more than one-half of the open contracts for some commodities. Earlier studies attempting to measure the impact of hedge funds on futures prices can be improved on for two reasons. First, the data used was generally taken from a period before the rapid increase in hedge fund trading. Second, without detailed information regarding supply and demand fundamentals, an identification problem arises in attempting to connect speculative activity to absolute price movements (Janzen et al.). One way to avoid the identification problem is to consider the spread in prices for the same commodity for two different expiry months. In a given market, we expect that inter-temporal price spreads display long-run historical relationships.

990,"This project is aimed at addressing two issues regarding plant growth, the production of pollen grains and lateral root generation. These are critical issues in vegetative growth and sexual reproduction in plants including major crops like rice and tomato in California. We employ biochemical, cell biological, and genetic approaches to understand molecular mechanisms that regulate cell division during pollen formation, and to discover novel factors that promote lateral root growth in plants. The experiments are initially carried out in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Successes in this reference plant will be translated into applications in rice and tomato. Ultimately, we aim to introduce novel genes that can be used to manipulate sexual reproduction and root growth in crops with the goals of improving tools in breeding and introducing novel approaches in acquiring drought and salt resistant traits by enhancing root growth.

These studies are exploiting our experimentally validated genome-scale functional gene network of rice genes, named RiceNet, to explore PRR-mediated immune responses in cereals on a genome-wide scale. Our long-term goal is to use all available resources, including genetic, biochemical and computational approaches, to develop a thorough understanding of the cereal PRR-mediated immune response network and to apply this knowledge towards the improvement of rice and other cereals. Our approach utilizes a non-biased, network-guided method to identify subnetworks of genes controlling PRR-mediated immunity.

992,"The Farm Service Agency has a long standing goal that the private sector be the provider of agricultural credit instead of direct loans from the U.S. Treasury. By determining what factors impact the duration (time to guarantee expiration) of guaranteed loans it will be possible to better predict the outcomes and expenses of this program. Moreover the government as a whole has a goal of providing for socially disadvantage borrowers and beginning framers. The results of the analysis will shed light as to how well members of these various groups perform in the guaranteed loan program. Second, agricultural finance researchers make ample use of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) in determining various characteristics of farm debt and borrowing behavior. This study will help more accurately measure the strengths and weaknesses of the ARMS data base for doing agricultural finance research. Third, the project will provide models of how returns to rice production and milling are affected by climatic variables.

993,"The emergence of fungal pathogens of plants and animals is a perennial and growing threat to food security and environmental sustainability. Genomic technologies offer new ways to interpret the ecology and evolution of pathogen emergence. This project investigates the emergence of fungal pathogens with economic and environmental relevance to build groundwork for sustainable strategies in the prevention and management of fungal epidemics.Economically important plants, including trees and commodity crops, produce defense compounds in response to infection by pathogens. Fungal pathogens, the most important threats to commodity plants, can become resistant to these compounds through the evolution of mechanisms to inactivate, evade or degrade them. For millions of years, plants and fungi have engaged in a chemical arms race of inventing and neutralizing novel compounds. In one part of this project, we propose to investigate the evolution of fungal counter-resistance to one class of plant defense molecules to better understand the basis of efficacy of natural resistance to fungi, using the economically important rice and wheat pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae as a model. The second part of this project aims to investigate the emergence of the fungus responsible for mass die-offs of bats, which provide significant agricultural services by reducing insect pest pressure on crops. Here, we propose to identify the factors in the emergence of virulence in the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, and identify the diversity of fungal viruses which may be used for biocontrol of this fungus by reducing the activity of these virulence factors.

994,"To produce crops, farmers need to use herbicides and cultural practices to control weeds. The costs of weed control reduce profits. This is an annual cost because a seed reservoir (bank) of dormant weed seeds is buried in the soil. Dormant seeds do not grow, can survive buried in soil for decades, and cannot be killed with current technology. As these seed populations gradually lose dormancy and germinate naturally, they provide an inoculum of new weeds every year. In Louisiana (and world-wide), red rice is a grass weed that reduces rice yield and increases crop production costs. If red rice seed dormancy could be removed, allowing weed seeds to grow, the resulting seedlings could be readily killed; this would reduce or eliminate the need for expensive annual weed control methods. While many empirically-derived techniques for &#39;breaking&#39; red rice dormancy are available in the laboratory, none are feasible for scale-up to farm use. The goals of this research are (1) to identify molecular targets within the seed that maintain seed dormancy, (2) design chemicals to neutralize these targets, and (3) break dormancy of weed seeds buried in the soil.

995,"Traditional plant breeding has significantly contributed to plant genetic improvement and increased crop production. However, continued genetic improvement of crops, such as cotton, maize, wheat, soybean and rice, will be largely contingent on the development of new knowledge and new tools enabling comprehensive understanding and effective manipulation of the traits important to agriculture, such as crop yield and quality. Therefore, extensive research has been pursued worldwide in molecular genetics, molecular biology and then genomics in crops in the past 30 years. However, few of the molecular and genomic tools have been widely used in plant genetic improvement and many of those used have been unexpectedly low in effectiveness due to shortage of cloned genes controlling agronomic traits and the molecular mechanisms underlying the trait development. This study will take advantages of the recent development of new disciplines and new technologies, including systems genomics, systems biology, next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing, high-throughput gene and QTL cloning, advanced computer science, bioinformatics and advanced statistics [1] to isolate the genes controlling 14 maize grain yield and quality component traits (number of ears per plant, plant height, grain moisture, number of kernel rows, ear length, ear diameter, kernel row length, cob diameter, kernel weight per ear, 500-kernel weight, protein, fat and starch contents) and 8 cotton fiber quality and yield component traits (fiber strength, uniformity, micronaire, elongation, lint%, lint yield, seed yield and seed size); [2] to decipher the molecular basis and regulation mechanisms of crop yield, quality, quantitative genetics, heterosis and polyploidization using the cloned maize and cotton yield and quality trait genes as model systems; and [3] to develop a gene-based breeding system enabling effectively enhanced breeding in two major crops in Texas and USA, cotton and maize. This project, once succeeded, will not only lead to cloning of a large number of genes controlling cotton fiber and maize grain traits and significant advance of our understanding of the molecular basis and regulation mechanisms of crop yield, crop quality, heterosis and plant polyploidization, but also revolutionize the current marker- or genomics-assisted breeding and precision agricultural production by gene-based breeding and gene-based agricultural production.

996," Eight major crops (corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, barley, oats and canola) account for almost 95% of the total cropland used in the United States (USDA&#39;s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)), and five major crops (soybeans, corn, cotton, sugar cane, and rice) account for almost 90% of the total cropland used in Brazil (FAPRI, Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture (CONAB), Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), and Institute for International Trade Negotiations (ICONE)).  Fundamental principles of plant pathology predict that given the scale and similarity of Brazilian and U.S. farming systems emergence of pathogens in one of these countries poses a threat to agriculture in the other. Through collaborative efforts between these countries effective controls can be deployed.

997,"Rice is critically important for the food security of humanity. The proposed collaborative study between the University of Illinois, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YAAS), and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) will improve domesticated Asian rice (O. sativa) with genes from its wild relatives, O. longistaminata and O. rufipogon. In particular, we will: 1) conduct high-density genotyping on an already established O. sativa x O. longistaminata recombinant inbred line population that has been found to be segregating for leafroller resistance, thereby facilitating marker assisted selection for this important trait, 2) determine genetic diversity and population structure for a collection of more than 200 accessions of O. longistaminata, 3) quantify genotypic variation within O. sativa and O. longistaminata for interspecific crossability and develop new interspecific hybrids, and 4) conduct studies to improve cold hardiness in rice. A visiting scholar from YAAS will be trained at the University of Illinois to conduct the genotyping and map genes associated with traits of interest, such as leafroller resistance. The genotyped recombinant inbred line population and new interspecific hybrids will also be a valuable genetic resource for future work to introgress genes for many different and desirable traits from O. longistaminata into O. sativa. Additionally, populations will be evaluated for cold tolerance during seedling stage and at flowering. Crosses will be made between a high-ratooning but non-cold-hardy selection from this population (&#39;PR23&#39;) and donors of cold tolerance, thereby linking work at the University of Illinois with work at IRRI and YAAS.

998,"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are unavoidable environmental pollutants produced from the incomplete combustion of organic materials. People are frequently exposed to PAHs through the food they eat, especially foods that have been grilled, barbecued or smoked. A variety of PAHs, which normally exist in complex mixtures, have been recognized as carcinogenic and capable of eliciting negative health effects in humans. The association between high PAH exposure and the risk of cancer has been established in various epidemiological studies. PAHs are also harmful to the human immune system and can significantly interfere with development of a fetus and/or child resulting in brain defects. Furthermore, early life exposures to PAHs are thought to increase incidence of liver cancer later in life. While a portion of PAH exposures result from inhalation of airborne contaminants, dietary exposure has also been shown to play a significant role in the formation of DNA damage, which could lead to cancer. Our recent survey in a US city with high incidence of liver cancer in San Antonio, TX indicated that approximately half of study participants had detectable levels of a PAH biomarker in their urine, suggesting considerable exposure to one or more PAHs. In addition, our laboratory reported increased levels of a urinary aflatoxin (AF) biomarker in the same community, which correlated with consumption of corn tortillas, rice, and nuts. AFs are naturally occurring toxins produced by Aspergillus fungi that frequently contaminate commodities such as maize, peanuts and tree nuts and exposure to the most prevalent and potent type of aflatoxin, AFB1, can cause liver toxicity, suppression of the immune system, and decreased growth rate in animals and humans. Chronic exposure to AFs is a major risk factor for the development of liver cancer. The aflatoxin problem is especially pronounced in traditionally underserved communities and high risk areas due to the frequent consumption of moldy foods or disproportionate consumption of foods containing aflatoxin-contaminated ingredients. In fact, a study recently completed by our laboratory indicated that approximately 85% of the Texas study population exhibited detectable aflatoxin B1-albumin adducts, an exposure biomarker found in the blood. This is increased from 21% in 2009 and likely a result of recent droughts (unpublished data). Thus, strategies that reduce multiple exposures to PAHs and AFs are highly desirable for populations at risk for both agents. The PAH, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), is similar to AFB1 in that both AFB1 and BaP are toxic to the immune system and are strong carcinogens, leading to the development of tumors. Among various strategies that have been successfully used to reduce human exposures to mycotoxins, the binding of AFs in the gastrointestinal tract by a specific type of clay has been shown to be a safe and viable approach. This conclusion is based on previous studies by our laboratry using multiple animal models and clinical intervention trials in humans in the US and Ghana where it was shown that NovaSil (NS) clay, administered by capsule or in food, significantly reduced exposure to AFs. Although no successful clinical interventions have been reported for PAHs using similar clay enterosorbent strategies, certain food ingredients, including powdered young barley leaves, rice bran fiber, lignin and other plant-based components such as quercitin and chlorogenic acid may bind to a variety of PAHs, thereby reducing their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. The findings from this research will be of direct relevance to vulnerable populations where consumption of a diet contaminated with PAHs and AF occurs frequently. absorption; adduct; Aflatoxin B1; Aflatoxins; Albumins; Animal Model; Animals; Area; Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons; Aspergillus; base; Benzo(a)pyrene; Biological Markers; Biological Markers; Blood; Brain; Breathing; cancer risk; Carcinogens; Child; Chlorogenic Acid; Chronic; Cities; clay; Clinical; Communities; Complex Mixtures; Consumption; Data; Defect; Development; Diet; Disease; DNA Damage; Droughts; early life exposure; Eating; Environmental Pollutants; Epidemiologic Studies; epidemiology study; Exhibits; exposed human population; Exposure to; Fetus; Fiber; Food; food consumption; fungus; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Ghana; Growth; Health; Hepatotoxicity; high risk; Human; Immune system; Incidence; Intervention; Intervention Trial; Laboratories; Lead; Life; Lignin; Maize; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant Neoplasms; Methods; Mycotoxins; novel; Nuts; Participant; Plants; Play; Population Study; Populations at Risk; Powder dose form; Reporting; Research; Rice; Risk Factors; Role; Smoke; Surveys; Texas; Toxin; Trees; tumor; urinary; Urine; Vulnerable PopulationsNOVEL METHODS FOR MITIGATION OF DIETARY RISK FACTORS FOR DISEASE",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999
999,"Contamination of food and feedstuff by mycotoxins is a worldwide problem for corn, wheat, barley, oat, tree nuts, rice, peanut, sorghum, hay, fruits, and other crops. Detoxification of the mycotoxins through either adsorption or degradation as the last defending mechanism in preventing the adverse effects of the mycotoxins to humans and animals is still critical. This study is aimed to select and modify clays and layered double hydroxides to improve their binding efficiency for these five major agriculturally important mycotoxins. We also will tackle more practical challenges in the use of the clays and layered double hydroxide in removing or inactivating the mycotoxins in vitro (fermentation) and in vivo. The specific objectives are to: 1) Modify smectites to ensure the nanominerals&#39; binding efficacy for aflatoxins in real corn fermentation solutions; 2) Modify smectites to improve the nanominerals&#39; catalytic functions in degrading adsorbed aflatoxins in corn fermentation solutions; 3) Engineer smectites to detoxify aflatoxins in vivo at realistic toxin levels in broiler chickens; and 4) explore and modify clays and layered double hydroxides for binding fumonisin, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone. Once implemented in practices, the adverse effects of the mycotoxins to animals and humans; and the economical losses of corn growers, biofuel industry, and animal industry can be minimized.Arsenic, zinc, lead, copper, nickel and many other heavy metals are the major concerns of acid mine drainage (AMD) resulting from the oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed to air. In theory, acid mine drainage and heavy metal contamination should not be problems in limestone areas due to the abundance of carbonate minerals that can neutralize the acidity. Poorly crystalline nanoparticles such as various iron oxides, silica, and the oxides of heavy metals are the most reactive compounds in regulating the heavy metals. Unfortunately, our knowledge on these reactive particles in the limestone environment or the liming reclamation areas is very limited due to the difficulties of characterization of these materials with common methods and instruments. The general objectives of our study are to: 1) characterize on an atomic scale low-crystallinity nanoparticles and colloids generated in AMD and examine their transformations in a limestone environment, 2) characterize As (the major focus), Zn, Cu, and Pb speciation in each associated solid phase and quantify the mobilization and transformation of As and the heavy metals associated with the mineral phase conversions, and 3) model the reactivity of the nanoparticles and the geochemistry of As and heavy metals in the limestone environment. This proposed study will characterize both representative field samples and simulation samples, combine several advanced spectroscopic and microscopic methods and geochemical modeling to address the speciation, composition, atomic scale structures and the influence of the heavy metals and metalloid on the nanoparticles. The results will offer more insight to the geochemistry of the nanoparticles AMD and offer more structural and thermodynamic parameters for modeling.

1002,"Insects are important constraints on rice yields in Louisiana. The rice water weevil, the major early season insect pest of rice in Louisiana, typically causes yield losses ranging from 5-10% in fields where it is not managed properly, but can cause yield losses in excess of 30% under heavy infestations. The rice stink bug , the major late-season pest of rice, occurs annually in nearly every rice field in Louisiana and can reduce both grain yield and quality. Stem boring insects have long been pests of sporadic importance in Louisiana, and their importance has increased dramatically with the recent invasion and establishment of the Mexican rice borerin southwest Louisiana. In addition to these major pests, a number of other insects occasionally cause losses in some fields. These sporadic pests include Colaspisbeetles, the fall armyworm, the South American rice miner, and chinch bugs. Losses from these insect pests occur in the context of fluctuating rice market prices and increasing input costs; thus, cost-effective insect management practices are vital to maintaining the economic viability of rice production in Louisiana. Moreover, management programs for insect pests must be sustainable over long periods of time--i.e., impacts on non-target species and the environment should be minimized, and measures should be taken to avoid the development of insecticide resistance in target pests. In addition, management tactics for insect pests of rice must be compatible with common agronomic practices (e.g., crawfish production) and with tactics used against weed and disease pests. The overall goal of this project is the development and implementation of cost-effective and sustainable management programs for arthropod pests of Louisiana rice. Whileinsecticides remain the primary means of controlling arthropod pests, alternatives to insecticides are needed to reduce costs, improve sustainability, minimize environmental impacts, and insure compatibility with other agronomic practices. The research proposed in this project will focus on the three major pests of rice in Louisiana, the rice water weevil, the rice stink bug, and stem borers. For each pest, several critical areas of researchhave been identified. Aprogram of research will be developed and executed annually to meet these needs. Results of research will be disseminated to growers and stakeholders by a variety of means.Proposed research includes evaluation of new insecticdes and combinations of insecticides against rice water weevils, stem borers, and stink bugs. In addition, alternative tactics will be studied in order to reduce costs, improve sustainability, minimize environmental impacts, and insure compatibility of insect management programs. The objectives of the proposed research include:1) Reduce the amount of insecticide applied to rice in Louisiana via the adoption of improved action thresholds, alternative management tactics, and more appropriate use rates.2) Increase the intentional use by growers of rice varieties resistant to rice water weevil, stem borers, and other pests.3) Increase grower awareness of the value of cultural practices such as early planting and delayed/shallow flooding, and quantify the value of the cultural practice of draining fields.4) Improve our understanding of the mechanisms of yield loss from the rice water weevil and of the role of natural enemies in controlling rice pests.

1003,"The 2014 Farm Bill (Agricultural Act of 2014) was passed into law in February of 2014. Farm bills define and authorize agricultural programs for the subsequent five or six years. The policy changes in the new farm bill are the most far reaching since the 1996 bill when policy changes were largely driven by efforts to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations that stipulate member nations must reduce their use of production-promoting and trade-distorting agricultural policies.As a result of a recent trade dispute brought before the World Trade Organization&#39;s dispute settlement panel, cotton was singled out for the first time in the 81 year history of field crop subsidy programs in the 2014 bill. Cotton is excluded from two new crop programs but is eligible to received payments under a new insurance program exclusive to cotton. While these unprecedented changes to the treatment of cotton in the new farm bill make significant progress towards reforming cotton subsidy programs, the question remains whether the new policies are less trade-distorting than the predecessor policies. In addition, it has yet to be determined whether or not the policies awarded to cotton are more or less distorting than policies awarded to other feed grains (referred to as  program crops  which include corn, wheat, oats, barley, soybeans, and rice). This research seeks to address these questions using USDA data and simulation analyses.Furthermore, cotton is now excluded from receiving payments from programs upon which payments are calculated based on historic production determined by crop specific acreage and yields during a specific previous time period. These historic acres are referred to as  base acres . While cotton producers are no longer entitled to payments calculated using base acres, cotton producers with historic base acres associated with cotton production now have the ability to reassign these cotton base acres, referred to as  generic base , each year to another planted program crop. For that year, those generic base acres are considered base acres for the program crop to which they were assigned for the purposes of calculating program payments. Thus, producers with generic base acres have an incentive to make planting decision based on expected support payments for the various supported commodities and market price expectations. This is likely to lead to production distortions. This research seeks to estimate the potential production distortions associated with producers reallocating their base acres using USDA data and simulation analyses.

1004,"This project is aimed to develop new fibrous and biopolymer materials from natural sources. Natural precursors include fiber crops such as cotton and wool, biopolymers such as polysaccharides, proteins and polyphenolics as well as nanocelulose derived from under-utilized agricultural crop residues and food/beverage processing by-products. Nanocellulose will be derived from the most abundant agricultural and processing by products such as rice straw, almond shell, grape pomance, etc. Depending on dimensions and surface chemistries, these nanocellulose may be assembled into nanofibers, sub-micro sized fibers, hydrogels, aerogels, porous membranes and films or used as coating and emulsion formulations.Analytical tools to assess the quality of natural fibers as well as green processing and sustainable means to improve functions and acquire new properties of natural fibers and products will be developed and explored. Polymer chemistry in combination with fiber spinning processes will be designed and developed to enable spinning of natural polymers into nanofibers, fibrous materials of unique pore structure and surface chemistries. Novel chemical properties of fibers will be achieved by biochemical and green chemistry processes. Functional properties such as hydrophilic, hydrophobic, ionic and chelating, amphiphilic, electrolytic, and stimuli-responsive behaviors will be targeted. Improved wetting and transport, controlled release of compounds, temperature and/or pH responsive behavior (pore size control), and enzyme stabilization against environmental factors will also be pursued.Converting these lignocellulosic residues into value-added products is a win-win solution to alleviate waste handling and disposal as well as environmental issues while generating economic returns to the growers and/or processors. Furthermore, supplying material demand from these renewable by-products reduces our reliance on the synthetics derived from fossil fuels. More sustainable and novel functional fibrous materials will meet the ever increasing and immense demand of higher performance fibrous products for human comfort, performance and protection as well as for high performance industry applications. adhesive protein (mussel); Agricultural Crops; Agriculture; Almond Nut; analytical tool; Behavior; Beverages; Biochemical; Biopolymers; chemical property; Chemistry; controlled release; design; Dimensions; Drug Formulations; Economics; Emulsions; Environmental Risk Factor; Enzymes; Fiber; Film; Food; Fossil Fuels; Gossypium; Grapes; Human; Hydrogels; improved; improved functioning; Industry; meetings; Membrane; nanofiber; novel; Performance; Polymer Chemistry; Polymers; Polysaccharides; Process; Property; Rice; Solutions; Source; Stimulus; Structure; Surface; Temperature; wasting; WoolNATURAL FIBERS AND BIOBASED POLYMERS: NEW STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS",1e-06,1e-06,2.4751435916131063e-05,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999
1005,"The primary focus of this Hatch project is to improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms of soil processes and plant nutrition that regulate nutrient cycling, identify nutrient management that optimizes rice crop yield, and decrease environmental impacts from nitrogen use. Climate change, food and energy security, population pressure, and limited natural resources are critical challenges facing agroecosystems (CCSP, 2008; FAO, 2009; GCRP, 2009; M&uuml;ller et al., 2009). Nutrient cycling is a fundamental component of agroecosystem functions. The main goal of integrated cropping system nutrient management is to improve nutrient use efficiency and decrease negative environmental impacts. To fully explore the benefits of integrated cropping system nutrient management requires a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nutrient biogeochemistry cycling.A major component of this proposal focuses on management practices affected rice production in southeast Texas and surrounding rice production regions, as well as other crops produced in this area. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of different management practices (i.e. water, fertilizer, tillage, rotation, and planting time) on rice nutrient biogeochemical cycling. Of particular interest in this proposed research and extension program is flooded agricultural ecosystems.Flooded water management is one of the most significant characteristics in irrigated rice agroecosystems and fundamentally modifies soil physical, chemical, and biological properties (De Datta, 1981). Soil physical properties are primarily affected by the saturated soil moisture, and the heat capacity of water is greater than that of other soil components (mineral or organic matter). Thus, the soil temperature of a flooded rice field fluctuates less than soils from an upland crop field. Flooding also creates a more or less continuouslanaerobic environment.Chemically, the following soil properties are affected by flooding: 1) depletion of molecular oxygen, 2) chemical reduction of the soil, or a decrease in redox potential, 3) increase in pH of acid soils and decrease in pH of calcareous and sodic soils, 4) increase of specific conductance, 5) reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and Mn(IV) to Mn(II), 6) reduction of SO42- to S2-, 7) increase in supply and availability of nitrogen (N), 8) increase of availability of phosphorus (P), silicon, and molybdenum, 9) decrease in concentrations of water-soluble zinc and copper, and 10) generation of CO2, CH4, and toxic reduction products such as organic acids and hydrogen sulfide (Ponnamperuma, 1972). Along with the modified soil physical and chemical properties, the soil microbial community changes as well (Pet-Ridge and Firestone, 2005). Accordingly, nutrient availability changes spatially and temporally (Norman et al., 1990; Wilson et al., 1989). For example, Ponnamperuma (1965) reported that more nitrogen is available under flooded soil than unflooded soil. The author explained that the lower N immobilization under flooding results in increased net N mineralization.The nutrient-use efficiency is also affected by the interactions between the rice crop and soil processes a regulated by management practices (Samonte, et al., 2006; Wu and Wilson, 1998). The interactions between soil properties, root development, and management practices are important aspects for integrated cropping system nutrient management. Roots of the rice crop are responsible for mineral nutrition (Yoshida, 1981). Compared to other upland crops, rice is more efficient in oxygen transport from leaf to root zone, which helps to form localized aerobic conditions in the rhizosphere (Yoshida, 1981). The spatial configuration and distribution of rice roots determines root system architecture in soil (Yamauchi et al., 1996), which primarily regulates the acquisition of soil resources like nutrients and water. Studies have shown that management practices affect root growth and activity. For example, Yang et al. (2004) reported that incorporation of organic resources such as plant residue or farmyard manure increased root length density and root weight density. These authors also observed the adverse effect of continuous waterlogging on root activity. In a FACE (free-air carbon dioxide enrichment) study, Chen et al. (2006) reported that elevated CO2 increased rice root biomass and ratio of roots to shoots, which partially explained the increased rice yield (Kim et al., 1996). Kim et al. (1996) also indicated that elevated temperature did not significantly affect rice roots and grain yield.Based on the above cited research and other studies (Dobermann and White, 1999; Dobermann et al., 1998), site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) has been proposed for rice nutrient management by IRRI (2000). The SSNM focuses on developing a nutrient management program that takes into account indigenous nutrient supply at each site (&#39;site-specific&#39;), temporal variability in plant N status occurring within one growing season (&#39;season-specific&#39;), and medium-term changes in soil P and potassium (K) supply. The application of SSNM has been reported to increase nutrient efficiency and rice yield in Asia (Khurana et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2001). In the United States, the linkage of indigenous nitrogen supply to rice N demand has contributed to an effective N recommendation technique, N-Star, for direct-seeded, delayed-flood rice production (Roberts et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2011).Recently, however, some studies indicate that enhanced cropping intensity exerts an undesirable effect on soil N availability by affecting soil organic matter quality. Olk and Gregorich (2006) reviewed the effects of repeated cropping under wet or submerged soil conditions on rice yield. These authors attribute yield decreases to a reduction in crop uptake of N mineralized from soil organic matter (SOM). One important factor was the accumulation of phenolic lignin compounds in SOM, which is biologically more resistant than other forms of SOM. In addition, many studies have indicated that soil structure dynamics, namely soil aggregate turnover, plays an important role in soil processes and nutrient cycling (Six et al., 1999; Six et al., 2002a; Six et al., 2002b; Dou et al., 2006; Dou et al., 2008). Six et al. (2000) summarized the functions of soil aggregates physically protecting soil organic matter, influencing microbial community structure, limiting O2 diffusion, determining nutrient adsorption and desorption, and reducing runoff and erosion. To improve the fertilizer use efficiency, therefore, it is imperative to incorporate these new findings into rice nutrient management.Besides crop production, environmental quality is another important focus of integrated cropping system nutrient management. Over-applied nutrients (mostly N and P) may enter surrounding water bodies and decrease water quality. Inappropriate management practices can result in an increase in the loss of C and N in gaseous forms (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, and N2) some of which are important sources of greenhouse gases. Therefore, nutrient management is very critical for ecosystem productivity, health and sustainability.

1006,"Similar to any biological organism, weed communities have the potential to evolve resistance to selection pressure imposed on them (Gressel and Segel 1978; Harper 1956). Herbicides typically exert enormous selection pressures due to high control efficacies. Currently, herbicide-resistant weeds pose an immense threat to crop production efficiency worldwide. As of 2015, there are 449 unique cases of herbicide resistance in 245 weed species across the world (Heap 2015). A common phenomenon shared by these cases is that weed management practitioners relied heavily on few herbicide options without implementing sufficient management diversity (Norsworthy et al. 2012).In Texas, the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds is an emerging problem in several cropping systems, tremendously affecting crop yields, quality and profitability. Currently, glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth and common waterhemp are two major weed issues in Texas causing serious economic damages in a number of row-crops, including cotton, sorghum, corn and soybean (Baumann 2013; McGinty et al. 2015). Herbicide-resistant annual ryegrass (resistance to ALS- and ACCase-inhibitors) is a serious threat to wheat production throughout the Blacklands of Texas (Swart 2012; Swart et al. 2012). The first ALS-inhibitor-resistant johnsongrass was reported in 2000 (Green 2000) and currently more resistant populations are suspected in Texas corn and sorghum. In Texas rice, ALS-inhibitor-resistant red rice (Avila et al. 2005) and barnyardgrass (Bradshaw, personal communication) are two of the important resistant weed problems. As a result of growing resistance issues, producers are forced to use more and more environmentally less-benign herbicides in their weed management programs, which has a direct impact on production costs and the environmental footprint of weed management practices. Surveys indicate that herbicide-resistant weed issues have tremendously increased herbicide use, hand-weeding, and mechanical tillage, tremendously increasing crop production costs (Sosnoskie and Culpepper 2014). In areas where conservation tillage practices have been adopted for long-time, returning to tillage as a means for controlling herbicide-resistant weeds has been jeopardizing all the soil conservation gains made over the past several years (Shaw et al. 2012). Overall, herbicide resistance issues have been threatening the sustainability of economical weed management in several cropping systems in Texas.Although herbicide resistance, particularly resistance to glyphosate, is a growing problem in Texas, it is still in its early stages in several parts of the state. There is a critical need to prevent further evolution and spread of resistant weeds and effectively manage already existing resistant populations. The key to preventing resistance is to be proactive, but a better understanding of the factors influencing the evolution of herbicide resistance can guide the deployment of robust and effective proactive tactics. Knowledge on weed biology, population genetics, management factors, and their interactions is vital to understand the evolutionary dynamics of herbicide resistance. However, research information is often limited in this regard.Developing a robust resistance management strategy begins with an understanding of the background levels of resistance at regional scales. A key consideration to herbicide resistance management is managing selection pressure (Norsworthy et al. 2012), which is achieved through diversifying management tools by integrating both chemical and non-chemical options. Diversified approaches will minimize selection pressure placed on a single management tool. Yet, the number of tools available for effective resistance prevention and management are limited. While there is a need to develop additional tools for integration, it is critical to protect and preserve all the management tools that are currently available. Additionally, research efforts are needed to develop stewardship practices to ensure sustainable deployment of herbicides and herbicide-resistant crop technologies in our cropping systems and minimize potential unintended impacts on the broader environment. Further, developing decision-support tools are necessary to facilitate extension and outreach activities geared towards promoting widespread adoption of sustainable resistance management practices.

1007,"Irrigation and stock ponds providing higher levels of nutrients and stagnant conditions are highly vulnerable to algal blooms especially during warm spring to fall months. Several studies reported that algal toxins may adversely impact the germination of seeds, and affect the growth, quality and productivity of crops. Exposure of several crops such as lettuce, rape, ryegrass, and rice to various concentrations of toxins indicated that photosynthesis was reduced by 50%, root development was inhibited especially in rape. It was reported that longer exposure to toxins result in more significant damage to crops. Toxins may be taken up through the roots of the plants or may deposit on the surface of the fruits and vegetables.This project will investigate i) the occurrence of algal blooms and release of detrimental algal metabolites in agricultural ponds in Northern Colorado; ii) study the impacts of toxins on crop growth; and iii) investigate toxin uptake by plants to foresee possible adverse impacts on humans consuming the crops. Monitoring efforts will indicate whether current conditions lead to release of alarming levels of algal toxins and odorants.

1008,"Wheat, rice and barley are among the most important crops in the US and worldwide. Grain shape, especially rice grain length, is a major agronomic trait affecting yield and quality of the grain product. Grain length is genetically controlled by a large number of genetic loci. During the past two decades, intensive genetic research work worldwide has led to the cloning of about a dozen genes that regulate grain length in rice. More genetic loci that may play a role in grain length determination have also been mapped to chromosomes. Working with our collaborators, we have recently identified a genetic locus that has a major effect on grain length control in rice. The mutant allele of this gene leads to the development of long grains in mutant rice lines. The putative gene underlying this mutation has been mapped to a small region of chromosome 2. The gene has been cloned and sequenced. In this project, we will characterize the isolated gene at the molecular level. We will investigate how this gene exerts its function to regulate grain development. Finally, we expect to identify its homologous genes in barley and wheat, and will explore the possibility of increasing grain length of barley and wheat by manipulating the function of this gene. An improvement in grain length may eventually help breeders to develop new cultivars of barley and wheat with increased grain yield and improved grain quality. Thus, the knowledge gained from the proposed work is important not only for rice research and production, but may also have potential applications to the improvement of grain size, yield and quality of wheat and barley, two major crops in Idaho and the whole USA.

1009,"This proposed research is a multidisciplinary study on fungi associated with grasses, including wild grasses in nature and domesticated turfgrasses. It integrates basic fungal biology study, molecular diagnostic technology development and application. Despite two centuries of study, most of fungal biodiversity on Earth remains unknown. Where are all the undescribed fungi? Our preliminary results indicate that grass (Poaceae) roots in pine barrens are one of the major reservoirs of novel fungi with about 47% being undescribed species. Importantly, we observed that Acidomelania panicicola, a new species we described from switchgrass in the New Jersey Pine Barrens significantly increases root hair growth of switchgrass and rice plants in acidic and low nutrient conditions. Given these observations, the goal of my proposal is to obtain a holistic understanding of fungal biodiversity by studying the phylogenetics, taxonomy, genetics and functions of fungi associated with grass roots. Fungi also constitute the majority of pathogens that infect and damage turfgrasses. Early detection and accurate identification are essential for developing efficacious control strategies and turfgrass breeding. Traditionally, diagnosticians use direct observation or culturing of specimens to identify turfgrass pathogens. DNA macroarray and real-time PCR are molecular tools, which offer fast, culture-independent alternatives for the detection of microbes. The objectives of this proposal are two-fold: (1) study fungi associated with grass roots in the pine barrens ecosystem, specially on their biodiversity, systematics, genomics and functions; and (2) develop molecular techniques for rapid detection of turfgrass pathogens. This project will further the NJAES goals of enhancing the vitality, health, sustainability of New Jersey agriculture by delivering solutions to the challenge of achieving early pathogen detection, characterization and effective turfgrass and other crop management. The project will further the national goals for agriculture through studying the naturally occurring symbiotic fungi with switchgrass.

1011,"Warming in the climate system is unequivocal (1). This changed climate scenario presents many challenges for plant scientists focused on agricultural systems, including the need to adapt crop species for disease resistance under conditions of unprecedented increasing temperatures (2-4). The effects of climate change on plant disease will likely vary depending on the specific pathosystem, but there is consensus among scientists that changes in temperature and precipitation will affect the extent of plant disease severity for many plant species (5). Most past investigations related to climate and plant disease responses have focused on either modeling potential impacts on disease under different temperature/humidity regimes (2, 6, 7)or identifying disease resistance (R) genes that perform optimally under regionally-appropriate weather conditions (8-12). Although higher temperatures are speculated to accelerate the breakdown of resistance in many plant-pathogen systems by increasing disease pressure and/or altering R gene efficacy (2, 6), there are still very limited empirical studies that report impacts of high temperatures on plant disease and resistance (13, 14), and mechanistic insights are lacking. Higher temperatures associated with climate change are predicted to increase disease risk for many crop plant species. While the importance and implications of these predictions are accepted, little empirical data exists that explains why plants are more susceptible to disease under these increased temperatures or how the efficacy of certain disease R genes increases or decreases with higher temperatures. In this project we will use a systems biology approach to dissect rice responses that are influenced by temperature during interactions with an important bacterial pathogen (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), and provide new insights into how plants have adapted to temperature stresses in the environment.

1012,"SITUATION STATEMENT/ SUMMARY:Situation StatementPohnpei State of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) currently faces four massive and inter-related problems/issues: (1) food insecurity, (2) high incidence of diabetes and other NCDs (non-communicable diseases), (3) the low level of economic activity - including low agricultural production against high food imports, and (4) the increasing, negative impacts of climate change (Tuivavalagi and Del Rosario, 2014).The above-mentioned massive issues could all be  killed with one stone  if Pohnpei could grow a crop that locals find easy to grow and manage; has a huge market potential; could resist climate change; could contribute to food security; and could reduce dependence on imported, highly processed foods such as white rice, ramen, and white flour. There is indeed such a crop - BREADFRUIT; it&#39;s economic potential is phenomenal, however, the right variety (the Samoan ma&#39;afala variety already introduced and growing in Pohnpei) will need to be planted in orchards (under an agroforestry system), instead of the current limited individual plantings. Rather than clearing virgin forests to grow breadfruit, we will utilize the currently unproductive and unutilized degraded mal lands that currently cover huge areas of the main island of Pohnpei.A few studies have clearly indicated that the mal lands could be rejuvenated, however, no management strategy has been properly documented or widely known to the local farmers - leading to the continuing destruction of virgin forests whenever new land is needed for agriculture, while mal lands remain idle.Project Summary The main aim of the project is to conduct desktop-study, social-investigation, screenhouse-trials, and field-experiments to develop agrotechnology packages for the rehabilitation of mal lands for sustainable agriculture involving breadfruit (as part of a Pacific regional project which could help resolve critical issues facing Pohnpei) and other tree crops of economic potential. A second aim of the project is to increase our understanding of all types of soil and land degradation in Pohnpei, and suggest options for getting them rehabilitated. The project also aims at raising awareness and providing training for Pohnpeians to raise the local capacity for dealing with soil and land degradation issues.

1014,"Objective(s): The overall goal of this research project is to make food production more sustainable by using food processing technologies to add value to the byproducts generated from the harvest of specialty crops and production of processed foods. We will focus on the following three objectives over the next five years:    Objective 1: Increase the commercial value of plant-based, postharvest waste materials, high in dietary fiber and/or polyphenols (grape, berries, tomato, carrot, and olive pomace, olive leaves and water, mushroom byproducts), by reprocessing into healthful food ingredients. 1.1: Screen processing wastes for nutritional properties of the whole pomace, seeds, skins, and the extractable and nonextractable (high fiber) fractions using appropriate animal models. 1.2: Increase value by developing healthful ingredients with improved bioaccessibility to bioactive polyphenols by process treatments such as extrusion, thermal, chemical and enzymatic processing of the whole waste.   Objective 2: Enable new, commercial functional foods from high protein–based waste materials (nuts, legumes, rice, fish).  2.1: Analyze nutrient content of processed farm waste (soybean, peanut, rice and salmon) for functional properties and nutritional quality of protein fraction.  2.2: Formulate and test high protein gluten free health promoting products for consumer acceptability.   Objective 3: Enable value-added commercial applications of nanofibers from specialty crop waste materials to deliver bioactives in new functional foods.   Objective 4: Increase the utilization of post-harvest waste materials by identifying and removing astringent and mineral components that detract from taste, quality, nutritional value and consumer acceptance.  Approach: Objective 1: Determine if processed food wastes or their components from regional fruit and vegetable food processing have health promoting properties by using animal models of obesity and related metabolic diseases to evaluate bioactivity. Animal models are necessary since many bioactive compounds are not absorbed directly but are mediated by gut bacteria. Some waste materials may require fractionation, for example seeds from peels, in order to concentrate bioactive components to a useful level. Bioavailability and bioactivity of more bioactive compounds such as polyphenolics and plant sterols may be increased by removing and modifying dietary fibers that block accessibility to enzymes and gut bacteria. Bioactive food wastes such as mushrooms with high vitamin D content will be processed into films or coatings.   Objective 2: Develop new healthy and flavorful foods from high protein waste materials. Processing wastes from soybeans, peanuts, rice and salmon will be analyzed for protein composition and food related physico-chemical properties. The waste materials will be formulated into foods to increase protein content and improve protein quality. Waste ingredients are often high in insoluble fibers that reduce functionality and may require fractionation from fiber to improve useful properties.    Objective 3: Develop blow spinning technology to efficiently produce natural nanofibers for controlled release applications and evaluate potential pulmonary toxicity effects of nanofibers in mice after intratracheal instillation of nanofibers. Using blow spinning processes nanofibers will be created from food ingredients such as gelatin, chitosan, and fruit and vegetable pomaces (grape, carrot, tomato and olive) in order to eliminate or reduce potential inhalation inflammation or toxicity. Although the nanofibers will be used for encapsulation of bioactive compounds for oral delivery the potential for inhalation during process requires toxicity testing. The ingredients as well as the nanofibers will be evaluated for inflammation and toxicity in a mouse model to determine degree and persistence of inflammation or toxicity if any. Ingredients that are most biocompatible will be used in subsequent studies.  Objective 4: Develop strategies to mitigate astringency in post-harvest materials in order to increase their utilization.  Tannins and minerals contribute to astringency and the identification and characterization of these components is essential. Total and free mineral contents in waste materials (nut shells, hulls, pits, pomaces, skins and seeds from stone fruits, nuts, and persimmons) will be measured using microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry following microwave-assisted digestion or leaching.  Tannin levels in the same materials will be measured using total soluble phenolic, potassium iodate (hydrolysable tannin), and vanillin (condensed tannin) assays.  The metal (Zn, Cu, Fe) and protein binding properties of waste material tannins will be measured and compared to the properties of commercially available tannins.

1015,"Objective(s): Objective 1: Enhance the human bioactive properties of resistant starch and slowly digestible starch in commercial table rice (milled, brown, and colored) while maintaining sensory texture characteristics. Sub-Objective 1.1. In this sub-objective research will characterize the sensory characteristics related to resistant starch, slowly digestible starch, and the optimization of healthy starch in cooked rice. Sub-Objective 1.2. Under this sub-objective several methods to produce high-resistant rice starch in flour will be examined in a baked food product. Resistant starch has many colonic health-promoting properties, but often does not formulate well as an ingredient in baked foods.  Objective 2: Enable new commercial functional food products using whole grain rice and rice co-products. Sub-Objective 2.1. In joint research with CrispTek research in this sub-objective will focus on adding resistant starch, fiber, and protein to current low-oil absorbing frying batters utilizing rice foods and co-products. Nutritionally-enriched baked and fried foods will be developed that sustain sensory quality. Sub-Objective 2.2. Healthier rice milk beverages and improvement of rice bran soluble protein extraction for food and beverage use will be developed. Sub-Objective 2.3. The proposed research will develop and compare several methods to produce unique rice prebiotics combined with phenolics from blueberry pomace and spent green tea. The effectiveness of each prebiotic will be evaluated utilizing in vitro fermentations and a mouse model for colonic health.  Approach: Rice varieties vary in amylose content that lead to differences in digestibility.  Cooked table rice from different varieties will be evaluated for the amount of resistant, slowly digestible, and rapidly digestible starch based on in vitro digestion times.  Thermal processes and physicochemical methods will be used to produce high resistant starch content in rice flour and starch, which will be tested as ingredients in baked foods.  In collaboration with CrispTek, research will focus on adding resistant starch, fiber, and protein from rice foods and co-products to current low-oil absorbing frying batters.  Nutritionally-enriched baked and fried foods will be developed with sustained or enhanced sensory qualities.  Rice beverages will be developed that incorporate green technologies (e.g. focusing on raw materials and enzymatic treatments that do not rely upon previous stabilization).  Lastly, methods will be evaluated to produce prebiotics from rice that include thermal and physiochemical methods and encapsulation technologies.

1016,"Objective(s): The main objectives proposed in this Project Plan are to develop and improve sustainable management strategies for weeds and insects. Effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs are vital to a sustainable cropping system. Over the next 5 years, the project will focus on the following objectives:  Objective 1: Evaluate newer herbicide chemistries (i.e., 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPPD) inhibitors, cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors, etc.) for efficacy of weed control in sugarcane and crop safety, as well as older, currently registered herbicides to improve weed management (tank-mix combinations, timing of application, use of spray adjuvants, etc.).  Objective 2: Evaluate cultural control methods for reducing weed interference in sugarcane including, but not limited to: varietal differences in competitiveness of sugarcane, inter-row tillage timing, type, frequency, and rotational crops (including green manure cover crops) that could be used during fallow season compared with chemical fallow, and site-specific management.  Objective 3: Enhance the role of plant resistance in managing damaging infestations of stem borers (i.e., sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer) in sugarcane. Sub-objective 3.A: Characterize fiber among commercial sugarcane cultivars resistant to the sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer. Sub-objective 3.B: Identify borer resistant progeny in high sucrose bi-parental crosses.  Objective 4: Identify control tactics for managing damaging infestations of a hemipteran complex (e.g., sugarcane aphid, yellow sugarcane aphid, West Indian canefly, and sugarcane delphacid) to include the role of soil health on these infestations and new insecticides for controlling the complex.  Approach: The approach to meeting the objectives of this project plan will be primarily in the form of replicated field experiments. Some of these field experiments will also be supported by laboratory analyses. New herbicide chemistries, when they become available, will provide the potential for greater efficacy in weed control; however, determining appropriate application rates, application timing, and application methodology will require replicated field experimentation that are repeated in multiple years. Results from these experiments will be used for obtaining labeling by EPA and ultimately in formulating extension recommendations to sugarcane growers. Cultural controls provide opportunities for reducing weed pressure by planting sugarcane varieties with greater competitiveness resulting in more efficient tillage practices (i.e. fewer cultivations). Planting rotational crops (e.g. soybean and sweet sorghum) will provide an additional income stream to growers while also aiding in suppressing weed infestations. To develop these improved cultural practices will also require a series of field experiments. The results from these studies will also be used to develop extension recommendations for sugarcane growers. Enhancing the role of plant resistance in controlling the sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer will require a more in-depth knowledge of fiber composition in commercial sugarcane varieties. A replicated field experiment consisting of sugarcane varieties with known reaction to sugarcane borer and Mexican rice borer will provide plant tissue for detailed fiber analyses. Ultimately a fiber profile will be qualified and quantified that will allow selection for stem borer resistance in the absence of the insect pest. Finally, field experiments will be conducted to identify control tactics for managing damaging infestations of a four-species hemipteran complex infesting sugarcane. These experiments will seek to better refine damage thresholds and ultimately establish action thresholds for initiating insecticide applications. The most effective insecticide formulations will need be to be identified as well as determining their most economical application rates. Ultimately, the findings from this Project Plan will be used to develop improved and sustainable management strategies for weeds and insects pest of sugarcane primarily in Louisiana, but the findings are generally applicable for sugarcane grown in Florida and Texas.

1017,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is engaged in a wide range of training programs for medical-combat teams at facilities such as the Army Medical Simulation Training Centers, Naval Surface Warfare Medical Institute, and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS).  Many of these are focused on training in multiple-casualty scenarios involving multiple patients that medical personnel must handle simultaneously, often while under active threat.  While studies have demonstrated that multiple-casualty scenarios influence team performance by magnifying factors that contribute to team degradation, there are currently no validated tools to measure team performance in a multiple-casualty environment.  Many assessors use homemade checklists that only inventory Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) or Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3) skills.  Another widely used DoD teamwork tool, TeamSTEPPS®, was designed to assess teamwork around one casualty at a time and has not been adapted or validated for multiple-casualty scenarios.  Therefore, there is a growing need for assessment tools that can optimally utilize available resources including human observers and digitally captured data to extract meaningful and actionable information about team performance in such scenarios.Educational Testing Service (ETS) and its partners -- the USUHS, the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), and Rice University -- address this need with an innovative solution for the assessment of medical team performance in multiple-casualty combat environments.  Our approach uses automated behavioral analysis and psychometric modeling to produce efficient and reliable estimates of teamwork skills.  This effort will result in three major outcomes:(1) A direct observation (field) assessment tool that maximizes the pertinent evidence that human observers can reliably capture from live observations of multiple-casualty training scenarios.  This tool will be both paper- and computer tablet-based.  It will include psychometric modeling and evaluation and the development of a rater training and monitoring program to optimize consistency and accuracy of ratings.(2) A prototype automated assessment tool of individual and team performance that will augment the evidence that human observers provide by incorporating measures such as event timing, key behavior detection, and other important performance indicators through analyses of audio, video, and motion capture data captured at live training exercises.(3) A series of pilot evaluation studies utilizing advanced psychometrics models to gather validity evidence for both direct observation and automated tools to evaluate team performance.Our approach will provide a wealth of analytics on individual and team-level competencies, which can be used to make accurate, ongoing, and intelligent recommendations to instructors and trainees.  We will utilize USUHS' state-of-the-art virtual reality theater, where multiple-casualty exercises are regularly conducted, for data capture activities, prototyping, and demonstration.

1018,"In 2013, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Bohol Island in Central Visayas, Philippines, destroying thousands of structures and displacing over 350,000 Boholanos. In response, the International Deaf Education Association (IDEA), a local non-governmental organization (NGO), built homes using coconut lumber, plywood, and bamboo. While these homes are only intended to be a temporary solution, they are unable to last for the projected 5 years. Instead, within two years of being built, IDEA’s homes are deemed uninhabitable due to extensive termite damage. Termites pose a great threat to the 12′ × 16′ coconut wood homes, and rebuilding them every few years puts a strain on materials, workers, and their limited budget. Realizing the need for an inexpensive, sustainable, structurally-sound, and termite resistant building material, IDEA reached out to our design team to find a solution.  As the seventh largest rice-producing country in the world, the Philippines generates an abundance of rice husk, a termite resistant waste product from the rice milling process that is incinerated once discarded. Our team, Husk-to-Home, intends to capitalize on this termite resistance and design a rice husk composite board with properties relevant to the Philippines’ needs: lightweight boards with strength and stiffness that will prevent side-swaying and resist forces due to earthquakes [1]; water resistivity which will help structures withstand humidity and tropical storms; and termite resistance that will keep structures durable and free of pests. Huskto-Home plans to innovate rice husk composite boards by using inexpensive, accessible materials, minimal machinery, and a simple production process. The project’s mission is to create a proof of concept building material, composed of rice husks and an innovative formaldehyde-free binder, to construct long-lasting homes for the Bohol Island community.  In addition to creating an environmentally-friendly building material out of waste products, Husk-to-Home formed goals to source their materials locally and partner with IDEA to facilitate implementation. Following implementation in Bohol, the team hopes to make this inexpensive, formaldehyde-free building material available throughout all of the Philippines and other rice producing countries.

1020,"Project Summary:The ultimate goal of this research is to predict and optimize deposition of orally inhaled particles in the humanlungs for targeted drug delivery by employing an integrative, statistics-guided, multi-scale physiologically-realistic imaging-based and subject-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) lung model. To assess inter-subject variability in delivery of oral inhalation drug products to small airways in asthmatic lungs, we adopt anovel statistics-guided computational framework that applies cluster analysis to computed tomography (CT)imaging-based structural and functional variables over a population of asthmatic lungs to identify asthmaticsub-populations. We then apply our subject-specific lung model suite to selected representative subjects ineach sub-population to study inter-cluster variability. This strategy allows bridging individual and populationscales. Our airway model and CFD boundary conditions are based on CT volumetric image data of the humanlungs scanned at multiple volumes, representing normal and disease phenotypes in a physiologically-realisticand subject-specific manner. Our model is multi-scale because the airway model spans from the mouth cavityto the trachea as a three-dimensional (3D) geometry, then to the terminal bronchioles using a novel 3D-1D(three-dimensional large airways coupled with one-dimensional small airways) and 3D-3D (3D large airwayscoupled with 3D small airways) coupled approach, bridging from the central airways to the lung parenchyma aswell as describing regional ventilation. Our mechanics model is further integrated with thermodynamics modelsfor heat and water vapor transfer. Our CFD employs large eddy simulation, allowing accurate representation oflaminar, transitional, and turbulent flows under various breathing conditions. To address inter-subject variabilityin small airway delivery, we propose the following specific aims. (1) Obtain representative regional ventilationand geometry. (2) Construct physiologically-consistent 3D geometry of small airways. (3) Reproduceheterogeneous airway constriction for asthmatic subjects. (4) Develop oropharyngeal air flow, heat, watervapor, and particle models. (5) Develop acinar air flow and particle models. (6) Simulate air flow, heat, watervapor, and particle in small airways. (7) Validate computer models. We propose to analyze existing non-imaging and imaging databases from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). As a step towards apopulation-based analysis, individual airway models in healthy and severe asthmatic sub-populations will beused for CFD analyses under different breathing conditions to examine regional deposition in small airways.

The project will be implemented with the New York ClinicalInformation Exchange (NYCLIX), an existing HIE that spans most of the major hospitals in NewYork City (NYC).One limitation to the current approach to quality measurement is that it is usually institution-specific, limited to a single provider organization. The advent of HIE presents an opportunity tothink about quality in new ways and create new patient-centric quality measures that gatherdata wherever patients seek care.The specific hypotheses in this proposal are that 1) HIE-enabled e-Quality measures willallow better detection of ED quality assurance (QA) cases and frequent ED users and 2) use ofthese measures in ongoing programs will improve ED QA processes and decrease the numberof visits by frequent ED users.The Aims of this project are 1) Develop and validate a health information exchange-based toolto support new inter-institutional e-Quality measures for ED returns and frequent ED users, 2)Compare the performance of the new inter-institutional e-Quality measures to current site-specific measures with quantitative and qualitative methods and 3) Implement the new inter-institutional e-Quality measures in existing QA and case management programs and quantifythe impactThe primary outcomes include the number of patients captured in the 72-hour return andfrequent ED user cohorts with and without the new inter-institutional measures. Secondaryoutcomes include the number of 72-hour return cases constituting quality issues, and thenumber of visits by frequent ED users with and without the new inter-institutional measures.

1023,"PROJECT SUMMARYThe Vermont Department of Health Laboratory (VDHL) is applying for funding to obtain ISO/IEC 17025:2005accreditation. Funding is being sought to expand the VDHL quality system management, informationmanagement and testing resource capabilities so as to advance the Vermont and National food safety systemsin protecting the food supply. The VDHL plans to work in collaboration with the VDH Food and LodgingProgram which has a contract with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been enrolled in theManufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) since 2008. The VDHL will be the sole servicinglaboratory for Vermont's Manufactured Food Regulatory Program (MFRP). The VDHL has been a member ofthe Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) since 2005 and is the sole Vermont laboratory dedicated toresponding to public health foodborne emergencies. In order to comply with the MFRPS and to provide FDAwith data generated during response to foodborne outbreaks through eLEXNET, the VDHL must achieve andmaintain ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation as mandated by the Food Safety Modernization Act signed intolaw on January 4, 2011.VDHL is requesting funding for 3.25 positions to address the need to obtain and maintain ISO/IEC 17025accreditation: a Quality Systems Specialist, a Food Microbiologist, a Laboratory Information Specialist and .25FTE Laboratory Technician II.

1024,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application is in response to Component B of the FOA RFA-DD-14-002: Research Approaches to Improve the Care and Outcomes of People Living with Spina Bifida. Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare (GCSH) is a hospital and clinic system that provides care for children and adults with chronic disease with onset in childhood. All aspects of both acute and chronic care for these disorders is provided within this entity, which has been providing such care for over a century. A number of distinct programs exist at Gillette, with a particular emphasis on neuroscience disorders. The spina bifida (SB) program has a long history at Gillette, and all specialties necessary for the care of these patients are available in our program, both for the care of children and adults. These include pediatric and adult providers in PMR, orthopedics, urology and neurosurgery. We also have all forms of therapy available, with appropriate support staff. Other services are available for consultation within the community. Our physical structure includes a 60 bed hospital located in St Paul MN, with a network of specialty clinics. Our structure allows for us to see spina bifida patients in three distinct care models. The majority of patients are seen by the providers of theirchoosing, which reflects that we have had a large number of specialists available to care for these patients, over many years. For more than 10 years, we have had a dedicated multidisciplinary clinic for adults with SB, with all patients seen at a single event clinic. Sincethe Fall of 2013, we have started a similar model for pediatric patients, for those families who wish to consolidate their care to as few appointments as possible. In 2013, we saw nearly 500 patients in this diagnostic group, from infants to adults. Our patients come predominately from Minnesota and nearby portions of Wisconsin, Iowa and both North and South Dakota. We propose to enroll patients in the NSBPR at all sites. Our expanded research department is fully engaged in this process and we anticipate being able to capture a significant proportion of our patients, particularly given past successes in doing such work at GCSH. We are also submitting two research proposals that will be based on the use of data from the NSBPR. The first is a study of pediatric patients who have undergone intra- abdominal surgery with a cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shunt in place. Our hypothesis is that such surgery in these shunted patients is associated with a subsequent increase in shunt morbidity, either by shunt infection (i.e., peritonitis or infectious pseudocyst) or malfunction (due to absorption failure). The second study is of children and adults, and attempts to better characterize the epidemiology of pressure ulcers across the lifespan of these patients.

1025,"1626418Verduzco, RafaelAll matter is made up of atoms, but determining the precise atomic structure of materials is a fundamental challenge across virtually all fields of scientific research. Knowledge of the atomic structure of materials provides clues to the history of the Earth, the complex chemistry of the environment, the development of technologies for energy storage, and the structure and function of biological systems. This project will provide detailed imaging and compositional analysis of a broad range of materials through the acquisition of a Time-of-Flight Secondary Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TOF-SIMS). TOF-SIMS is a powerful technique that can detect atoms across the entire periodic table and provide a three dimensional image of materials' atomic composition and structure. The TOF-SIMS instrument will serve a wide range of fields, ranging from the Earth and environmental sciences to the biomedical fields and have a direct impact on the technological innovation and competitiveness of local industry. The projects' intellectual merit crosses fields as diverse as geology, materials for energy storage and conversion, nanomaterials research, bioengineering research, organic and hybrid organic/inorganic thin films, and Earth sciences. The broader impacts include the creation of new educational programs and support of regional research institutions and industry. At present, the Houston area does not have TOF-SIMS capabilities. The instrument will be managed by Rice University's Shared Equipment Authority, making the instrumentation available to both on-campus and off-campus users. The instrument will serve as a venue for a number of educational opportunities either directly by providing training opportunities to students and researchers in the Houston area or indirectly by supporting the educational efforts of related projects. Annual TOF-SIMS user meetings will be organized by the PI and held at Rice University to exchange techniques and results on different samples, bring in new participants, and educate interested researchers. The PI will also establish a graduate-level course focused on TOF-SIMS analysis of materials in materials science, and the course will include a hands-on module for sample analysis and student training.Quantitative compositional and structural analysis from the nanoscale to the micron-scale is essential for advances in virtually all fields of scientific research. This project will establish a Time-of-Flight Secondary Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) at Rice University for elemental, molecular, and isotopic imaging of materials relevant to earth sciences, energy storage and conversion, environmental remediation, and biosciences. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) is a powerful technique that can provide elemental or isotopic mapping at the sub-micron level for a wide range of materials, and the use of a time-of-flight detector (TOF) enables full mass-spectrum analysis, including the capability to separate species that differ in mass by as little as 0.001 amu and for collecting a wide mass range from H to U and beyond. The instrument can image materials with sub-50 nm lateral resolution and perform depth profiling with sub-10 nm resolution, thereby enabling three-dimensional materials analysis. Altogether, a modern TOF-SIMS instrument provides the capabilities required to analyze surfaces, organic films, biological materials, trace metals, and other materials both in-depth and in three dimensions. The projects' intellectual merit crosses fields as diverse as Earth sciences, materials for energy storage and conversion, nanomaterials research, bioengineering research, and organic and hybrid organic/inorganic thin films. In the Earth sciences, TOF-SIMS will be applied to geologically-relevant materials to study pathways and kinetics by which elements are transported in geological processes and trace element partitioning in micro- and nano-phases in hydrothermal systems. In energy-related research, the three-dimensional structure of photovoltaic blends and composite electrodes will be elucidated through TOF-SIMS. TOF-SIMS will be used to quantify the growth and doping of two-dimensional materials. TOF-SIMS will also be critical to the study of nanoparticle transport and toxicity in biological systems, providing simultaneous imaging of trace elements intracellularly, allowing parallel CN, P, and Pb images.  Finally, TOF-SIMS will provide nanoscale lateral and through-depth compositional analysis of thin film coatings. The proposed TOF-SIMS instrument will serve these and other research projects of interest to internal and external researchers in the Gulf Coast Region. The projects' broader impacts include fundamental advances in science and engineering research, support of local industry, and the creation of new educational activities. The acquisition represents the only TOF-SIMS instrument in the Gulf Coast region, and the instrument will be made available to regional research institutions and industry through Rice's Shared Equipment Authority. The TOF-SIMS at Rice will serve a wide range of fields, ranging from the Earth and environmental sciences to the biomedical fields and have a direct impact on the technological innovation and competitiveness of local industry.  Educational activities include annual TOF-SIMS user meetings, a graduate-level course focused on TOF-SIMS analysis of materials in materials science, and hands-on training for summer students and researchers. 3-Dimensional; Area; authority; Beryllium; Biocompatible Materials; Biological Sciences; biological systems; Biomedical Engineering; Complex; detector; Dimensions; Earth science; Ecology; Educational Activities; Electrodes; Engineering; environmental chemistry; Equipment; Film; Geology; Growth; gulf coast; Hand; Hybrids; Image; Industry; Institution; instrument; instrumentation; interest; ionization; Ions; Kinetics; Knowledge; Lateral; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Maps; mass spectrometer; Mass Spectrum Analysis; materials science; meetings; Molecular; nano; nanomaterials; nanoparticle; nanoscale; Participant; Pathway interactions; Phase; Process; programs; Recording of previous events; remediation; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Support; Resolution; Rice; Sampling; Science; Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion; Structure; student training; Students; submicron; Surface; System; Techniques; technological innovation; technology development; three dimensional structure; Time; Toxic effect; Trace Elements; Trace metal; Training; training opportunity; two-dimensional; UniversitiesMRI: ACQUISITION OF TIME-OF-FLIGHT SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETER (TOF-SIMS) FOR HIGH RESOLUTION 3-D MATERIALS ANALYSIS",0.999999,1e-06,3.0329103121309864e-06,1e-06,1e-06,3.4417482405472736e-06,1e-06
1026,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the  green-revolution,  dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of  release-ready  varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

1027,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Baldelli at the University of Houston and Professor Kelly at Rice University are developing a new type of microscope that is able to see molecules on surfaces faster and with higher sensitivity than regular microscopes.  With cameras, pictures can be taken that show colors to help identify objects; for example, grass is green and sky is blue.  However, to look at molecules, more specific information is needed about the  colors  that molecules absorb. For many molecules, this absorption occurs in the infrared region of light.  To look at these infrared colors, traditional cameras are not very good so methods that can obtain pictures without cameras are necessary.  Professor Baldelli and Professor Kelly are developing a new type of microscope to figure out the surface image of surface molecules.  The results of this new microscope are useful to all researchers interested in surfaces related to biomaterials, energy, and environmental topics. For example, it can be used to study the distribution of lipid molecules on cell membranes that controls proteins moving in and out of cells, which in turn regulate cell growth and signaling. It can also be used to look at chemical dopants on a thin film that accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells, an important step in efficient energy conversion. The research project also presents a valuable opportunity to learn and experience collaborative multidisciplinary research -- a current emphasis of science and engineering education.  The topics and research project have many components to encourage undergraduate and high school students into the research, including instrument building, data analysis and interpretation, and research presentations.  This later point is an important aspect since it builds much confidence in the younger students and scientist.Professors Baldelli and Kelly are developing a new state-of-the-art surface spectroscopic imaging microscope to study the molecular, spatial, and temporal evolution of patterns and chemical heterogeneity present in many fundamental and technologically important systems. This new CS-SFG (compressive sensing-sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy) imaging technique utilizes a digital mirror device (DMD).  The DMD is the heart of the DLP projector and flat screen displays.  It is a 2-D array of mirrors that reflects the SFG image onto a detector.  Using computer control and a random pattern generator, the signal intensity changes depending on which mirrors are reflecting toward the detector.  Each pattern results from 50% of the randomly chosen mirrors being turned on for each measurement.  After many such measurements, the image is reconstructed based on the signal and the known mirror pattern.  CS allows for efficient image acquisition where only a few percent of the total information is necessary to faithfully reconstruct the surface features.  Two configurations broad-band and narrow-band IR are set up to evaluate the effect on the image reconstruction.  In addition the detection system incorporates heterodyne detection to extract phase information forth monolayer signal.  This new capability allows for alternate imaging schemes and orientation analysis.  The effect of compression algorithms and quantitative analysis ultimately aid in the interpretation of heterogeneous monolayer films on surfaces. The CS-SFG microscope will be a significant improvement over current approaches that either use probe areas on the order of a millimeter or acquire the full hyperspectral data cube but at considerable expense in sample throughput. Once demonstrated, Professors Baldelli and Kelly are to employ this microscope to investigate the molecular-level static and dynamic details of chemical patterns (such as lipid domains) formed under the control condition of lithography and the transfer of films to solid substrates via the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The research project provides both graduate students and local high school students with highly interdisciplinary training in chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer science. absorption; Area; Arts; base; Biocompatible Materials; cell growth; Cell membrane; Cells; Chemical Dynamics; Chemicals; Chemistry; Color; computer science; Computers; Data; Data Analyses; Data Compression; Detection; detector; Devices; digital; Education; Engineering; Evolution; experience; Film; Frequencies; Generations; graduate student; Heart; heterodyning; Heterogeneity; High School Student; Image; Image Reconstructions; Imaging Techniques; instrument; Interdisciplinary Study; interest; Learning; Light; Lipids; lithography; Measurement; Methods; Microscope; Microscopy; millimeter; Molecular; monolayer; Optics; Oxygen; Pattern; Phase; Physics; Poaceae; professor; programs; Proteins; Reaction; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Rice; Sampling; Scheme; Science; Scientist; Signal Transduction; Solid; spectroscopic imaging; Spectrum Analysis; Students; Sum; Surface; System; Techniques; Training; UniversitiesOP: COMPRESSIVE NONLINEAR OPTICAL MICROSCOPY FOR DYNAMIC CHEMICAL IMAGING OF SURFACES",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
1028,"Non-Technical:Viruses have the natural capacity to deliver DNA into host cells - a powerful ability that is currently being leveraged for a variety of gene therapy applications, including for the treatment of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and a variety of pediatric genetic diseases. The safety and efficacy of these gene therapies ultimately rely on the ability of viruses to deliver the DNA to the correct tissues and to the appropriate levels without hitting non-target organs. This targeted and controlled delivery of therapeutic DNA by viruses is a tremendous hurdle that, once overcome, will enable the clinical translation of a greater number of life-saving cures. The NSF project aims to approach this overarching goal by developing viruses that can be controlled by safe, externally applied light. Using light as the  on  signal, the infectivity of therapeutic viruses will be carefully controlled in order to deliver the DNA to the desired tissues and to the therapeutically appropriate levels.  The associated educational activities will broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in science and technology. Specifically, predominantly African-American high school students from a critically underserved community in Houston, Texas will be introduced to scientific research and provided career mentorship. Undergraduate students will also be trained to conduct primary scientific research in the Principal Investigator's (PI's) lab. Finally, graduate students in the PI's lab will be highly encouraged to partake in the numerous outreach activities available to them through the PI's lab as well as other Rice University organizations. By training the next generation of scientific leaders to become conscientious of issues relating to gender and/or race, the PI hopes to contribute to our collective future where gender and race are no longer issues to be dealt with in STEM fields.Technical:Viruses have evolved to deliver genetic information into host cells, a key property currently being exploited for applications ranging from fundamental discovery studies to human gene therapy. However, more advances are required to transform naturally occurring viruses into well-controlled and predictable nanodevices. To this end, this NSF project will place viral gene delivery under the control of an externally applied stimulus, specifically light, such that transgene expression may exhibit more tunable intensity, controlled onset/duration, and spatial patterning. Importantly, results obtained from the work will help uncover new design rules for creating stimulus-responsive viral nanoparticles. Promising pilot data demonstrates successful generation of a prototypic light-activatable virus (LAV) platform. To overcome some of the deficiencies with the prototype platform that would hinder its translation to real world settings, this NSF project aims to generate second generation LAVs. The LAV candidates will be characterized for various structural and functional properties, enabling the further identification of design rules that may help inform future design modifications to the LAV platform. As part of the educational plan, the PI proposes to develop a STEM mentorship program between Rice University Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering and a high school located in one of the lowest income areas in the City of Houston, Texas. Additionally, undergraduate students will be recruited to the PI's laboratory to conduct research, and graduate students in the PI's lab will be trained as future leaders conscientious of gender and race issues in STEM fields. The students participating in the research will be trained at the unique interface of virus engineering and synthetic photobiology. The knowledge gained from the work will be widely disseminated through presentations at international conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

1030,"The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Angel A. Mart? and Professor Matteo Pasquali of Rice University to study the properties of tubular nanostructures made of boron and nitrogen known as boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). The goals of this research are to develop methods to chemically modify the surface of BNNTs and to study their solution behavior. Controlling the surface chemistry and organization of BNNT in solution will allow their utilization as building blocks for a variety of applications including high strength materials, water purification membranes, heat dissipation materials, and antifouling agents.  While exploring the chemistry of BNNTs, the PIs pursue broader impact activities to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering careers and to disseminate chemistry, engineering, and nanoscience concepts to the larger community. BNNTs are the ultimate building blocks for the manufacture of nanoarchitectures and novel macroscopic assemblies. However their chemical functionalization, dispersion, and phase behavior in liquids, and thus their self-assembly into supramolecular ordered structures, are still challenges in this field of research. In order to address these challenges, the proposed research involves synthesizing negatively charged BNNTs, or boron nitrides nanotubides (BNNTDs). The BNNTD properties provide control over the dispensability, chemical properties, and solution dynamics of BNNTs. This project involves studying how to prepare BNNTDs by chemical reduction and the functionalization of the BNNT surface by reaction of BNNTDs with alkyl and aryl halides.  The solution dynamics of BNNTs are studied using microscopy techniques. The results of this research will accelerate the maturation of BNNT science and technology, which is expected to provide new supramolecular structures with unusual combinations of properties (e.g., strong, flexible, electrically insulating, thermally conductive fibers). The research not only advances the state-of-knowledge in nanoscience, but also promotes the discovery and understanding of advanced nanotechnology concepts by graduate and undergraduate students.

1031,"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Zachary Ball from Rice University to investigate chemical reactions for protein modification. Proteins are incredibly large and complex molecules and selective alteration of proteins remains a daunting challenge. Nonetheless, chemically-modified proteins represent tantalizing opportunities. Applications of modified proteins include biomaterials for coatings or green energy and biological probes to understand, perturb, and inhibit biological pathways. Efforts under this award focus on developing new metal-mediated methods for protein modification. These novel methods allow the preparation of new sites with novel structures, reactivity, and biological properties. The research project is providing undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows with training in synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry. In addition, these research participants are receiving training in techniques and modern analytical methods of protein chemistry. An integrated outreach program is introducing modern protein chemistry and analytical methods to local high school teachers and their students.In order to develop sequence-selective protein modification catalysts, this project employs rhodium(II) conjugates that enable modification of proteins, whether purified or in lysate, on the basis of molecular recognition. Catalytic modification provides a covalent readout for the presence and location of ligand binding, and thus allows identification of ligand-binding sites of  hit  compounds. The reactivity can also be harnessed to quantify inhibitors of weak, transient interactions that are difficult to study with existing methods. In a new direction, Chan-Lam coupling of boronate reagents allows copper-catalyzed modification of peptides and proteins, with unique sequence specificity. Unnatural chemical modification of metalloenzyme active sites has emerged as a powerful tool in metalloenzyme design. Boronate coupling promises to provide exciting new tools to build hybrid metalloproteins with new function and reactivity.

1032,"Adaptation of crop plants like rice to environmental stress is an essential requirement to ensure high yields under those conditions.  Salinity is among the major environmental stresses that crop plants face, and it is currently threatening rice cultivation due to increasing land pressure and climate change, which are pushing agriculture to marginal lands. Rice is a major world crop comprising two species: one from Asia (Oryza sativa), and one from Africa (O. glaberrima). This project aims to identify genes associated with adaptation to saline soils through comparative analyses of rice varieties that have contrasting adaptation to salt stress, within and between the two species. The discovery of more than one adaptive strategy will increase the options rice breeders could implement in their programs. This project will use several approaches to identify genes that have a uniquely coordinated pattern of expression when the plant is exposed to elevated salt, and at the same time are correlated with vigorous growth and productivity. This project will also undertake public outreach programs using the New York City BioBus. This is a transit bus equipped as a mobile educational laboratory that has been on the road reaching 115,000 people at more than 420 schools and communities. Plant biology laboratory modules will be developed for deployment across New York City on the BioBus. These modules will primarily target schoolchildren in underserved communities, and also the general public in street fairs.Salinity is one of the growing stress challenges crop plants face. In this systems genomics proposal, we will dissect the adaptive response of O. sativa (Asian rice) and O. glaberrima (African rice) to salt stress. First, we will infer the gene regulatory interaction network for salt stress in Asian and African rice using time-series transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data, coupled with state-of-the-art network inference methods. Second, we will use phenotypic selection analysis on gene expression levels to determine the strength and pattern of selection on stress response genes. Finally, we will map expression genome-wide association (GWAS) loci accompanying gene expression variation under salt stress, focusing on the genes that have been identified in phenotypic selection analysis as undergoing positive, stabilizing or disruptive selection. Moreover, we will also identity GWAS loci for plant fitness and fitness-related traits under saline conditions in both rice species, and integrate the results of these mapping analyses and phenotypic selection analyses with evidence for selective sweeps in whole genome sequence data from Asian and African rice. Our work will identify genes, genetic networks and genomic variants that affect gene expression differences in key loci in response to an environmental perturbation - salt stress -and explicitly connect gene regulatory variation to plant fitness.

1033,"There is an extensive instrumental, historical, and geological record of tsunamigenic-earthquakes originating from the northern and middle parts of the Japan Trench that documents the last several thousand years of earthquakes and tsunamis, including the magnitude 9 Tohoku earthquake in 2011. This earthquake ruptured five segments along the northern and middle parts of the Trench, but failed to rupture through the southern part, which is near metropolitan Tokyo. The seismic risk for this portion of the trench is uncertain because of the possibility that stress transferred southwards during the 2011 earthquake and that this part of the subduction zone is locked. Furthermore, the instrumental and historical record is sparse with only one tsunamigenic-earthquake on record (CE 1677 Empo earthquake) and lack of long-term geological data. A research team from University of Southern Mississippi and Rutgers University in collaboration with Japanese researchers will employ an innovative combination of field, laboratory (sedimentary, microfossil, and radiometric analyses), statistical, and modeling techniques to a series of possible tsunami deposits in order to determine the tsunami and earthquake history of the southern Japan Trench, data which is very important for anticipating future disasters. Besides providing an improved understanding of seismic risk in the Tokyo region, additional benefits to society include improved STEM education though outreach to middle school students and development of a globally competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate and undergraduate students and post-doctoral fellow mentoring.The detection and characterization of tsunami deposits preserved in coastal sediments provides a long-term record of past earthquakes. This project focuses on three candidate-tsunami sands that are preserved in coastal rice fields in the Kujukuri beaches, a strand plain located on the Boso Peninsula approximately 50 km east of Tokyo. The identification of tsunami deposits using proxy analyses (grain size and microfossil), with Bayesian age-depth models and tsunami simulation models, will resolve whether the southern part of the trench can produce future earthquakes that are similar in size as the 2011 Tohoku event. Well-constrained ages for each candidate tsunami will permit an accurate estimation of the shoreline position, and thus, inundation distance at the time of deposition. By integrating these changing shoreline positions into previously developed tsunami simulation models (e.g., 2011 Tohoku and CE 1677 Empo models), the research team will test whether previous middle/northern or southern trench ruptures could have deposited the tsunami sands on the Boso Peninsula.

Besides providing an improved understanding of seismic risk in the Tokyo region, additional benefits to society include improved STEM education though outreach to middle school students and development of a globally competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate and undergraduate students and post-doctoral fellow mentoring.The detection and characterization of tsunami deposits preserved in coastal sediments provides a long-term record of past earthquakes. This project focuses on three candidate-tsunami sands that are preserved in coastal rice fields in the Kujukuri beaches, a strand plain located on the Boso Peninsula approximately 50 km east of Tokyo. The identification of tsunami deposits using proxy analyses (grain size and microfossil), with Bayesian age-depth models and tsunami simulation models, will resolve whether the southern part of the trench can produce future earthquakes that are similar in size as the 2011 Tohoku event. Well-constrained ages for each candidate tsunami will permit an accurate estimation of the shoreline position, and thus, inundation distance at the time of deposition. By integrating these changing shoreline positions into previously developed tsunami simulation models (e.g., 2011 Tohoku and CE 1677 Empo models), the research team will test whether previous middle/northern or southern trench ruptures could have deposited the tsunami sands on the Boso Peninsula.

1035,"In multicellular organisms, some cells specialize in secretory functions. Examples of secretory cells include certain vascular cells that secrete nutrients for distribution, epidermal cells that export protective compounds, nectaries that secrete solutes to reward pollinators, tapetal cells that nourish reproductive cells, and seed coat cells that secrete nutrients to fill seeds. Pathogens apparently tap into nutrient resources by manipulating nutrient secretion systems. Despite the importance of secretory cells, the understanding of these cells and biological processes is limited. This project seeks to identify the fundamental mechanisms of secretory cells, to permit the enhancement of crop quality and yield, of the interaction of plants with other organisms, and of stress tolerance. The project team combines expertise in the genome-wide analysis of individual cell types (Bailey-Serres,  & Girke, UC Riverside), membrane transport processes (Frommer, Carnegie, Stanford) and genome editing (Yang, Iowa State U). The project is expected to provide new tools and information of value for agriculture. Concepts and resources developed by the project will be integrated into classes at 2-year institutions with substantial enrollments of underserved students. A public website, blog and forum will provide discussion of genome editing technologies, with the participation of experts and local community colleges.The SECRETome project seeks to identify specific components and regulatory mechanisms of the varied functions of plant secretory cells. To enable an evaluation of gene function within individual cells and tissues, imaging, ribosome-mRNA complex capture, gene editing and informatics will be employed in an integrated fashion. A comparative approach will be enabled through the analysis of both the crop rice and the reference plant Arabidopsis. Specific aims include (1) the profiling of ribosome-associated transcripts (translatomes) of key secretory cell types with prominent roles in secretion or nursing of neighboring cells in the two species, in the context of two developmental processes and two biotic interactions, (2) the identification of characteristic gene expression patterns and networks for specific secretory cell-types to facilitate selection of candidate genes for functional studies, and (3) the validation and characterization of secretory cell-specific promoters and candidate gene functions, including subcellular location, biochemistry, and reverse-genetic phenotype. The secretory cell-specific promoters will be valuable for other studies (e.g., to control genes for cell-specific processes that enhance pathogen defense, beneficial microbial interactions, fertility or seed quality). The results will provide broad new insights into the intersection between cell function, development and biotic interactions. The project will produce public resources and discourse forums regarding genomic editing with the engagement of undergraduate students.

1036,"Part 1: Non-technical abstractThe roots of crop plants contain important microorganisms that allow the plants and microbes to satisfy their nutritional needs. The relationship between these two very different types of organisms is called symbiotic because both partners benefit from the association. The plant converts sunlight and carbon dioxide into sugars and other organic compounds that are supplied to the microbes in the roots. The microbes provide phosphate and nitrogen to the plant in forms that the plant can readily ingest. These symbiotic associations permit the growth of some crops without added fertilizer. For example, plants are unable to convert gaseous nitrogen in the atmosphere into a reduced form that can be incorporated into the proteins, vitamins and other critical biomolecules that allow them to germinate, develop and grow. Certain crops, such as the legumes (e.g., beans, peas and alfalfa) harbor nitrogen-converting bacteria within specialized structures in their roots that provide this reduced nitrogen to the plant. Most crops do not have these bacteria and must rely on the application of nitrogen fertilizer for optimal growth. This project seeks to obtain a molecular understanding of this symbiotic association between plant and microbes, with a long-term goal of enabling such an association in non-leguminous crops like corn and wheat, which currently require extensive fertilization to sustain crop yield.  A broader impact of this project is a summer Plant Proteomics Workshop, which provides training in proteomic and genomic profiling to the entire plant research community.Part 2: Technical abstractThis project seeks to profile the early molecular events in the recognition of and response to symbiotic microbes (nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) by the model legume crop, Medicago truncatula and the model monocot, rice. This approach will enable a comparison at the molecular level of the mechanisms by which these two crop groups recognize their beneficial microbes. The analysis of the shared and distinct chemical and genetic factors in these two systems should provide tools and information to enable the engineering of beneficial associations between cereal crops (e.g., rice, corn, wheat) and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. The specific aims are (1) the identification of host proteins modified by phosphorylation, acetylation or ubiquitinylation in first hour following signal reception, and validation of potentially active candidates from this and from the previous project award period, (2) the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic responses into networks that can be compared in the two species, using informatics and computational modeling, and (3) a high-throughput screen for symbiosis factors using a newly developed chemical genomics chip system. This project will expand a Plant Proteomics Workshop for training in the latest large-scale proteomic and genomic profiling technologies. abstracting; Acetylation; Alfalfa; Award; Bacteria; bean; Carbon Dioxide; Cereals; chemical genetics; Chemicals; Communities; Computer Simulation; Educational workshop; Engineering; Event; Fabaceae; Fertilization; Fertilizers; Fungi Model; genomic profiles; Genomics; Goals; Growth; high throughput screening; Hour; Informatics; inorganic phosphate; interdisciplinary approach; Medicago truncatula; Microbe; microorganism; Modeling; Molecular; Nitrogen; Nutritional; Organism; Phosphorylation; Pisum sativum; planetary Atmosphere; Plant Roots; Plants; Proteins; Proteomics; Research; response; Rhizobium; Rice; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Structure; sugar; Sunlight; Symbiosis; System; Technology; tool; Training; transcriptomics; Validation; Vitamins; WheatRESEARCH PGR: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO DECIPHERING MOLECULAR SIGNALING PATHWAYS CONTROLLING PLANT-SYMBIONT ASSOCIATIONS IN LEGUMES AND CEREALS.",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,2.129357338497833e-06,7.013992699232076e-06,1e-06
1037,"PI: Thomas Brutnell [Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, (DDPSC)]CoPIs: Elizabeth Kellogg and Todd Mockler (DDPSC), Kimberly Gallagher (University of Pennsylvania), Chris Myers (Cornell University) and Joyce Van Eck (Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Science)Senior Personnel: Robert Turgeon, Qi Sun, and Klaas van Wijk (Cornell University)Declining yields, increasing population growth and shifting climates are converging to create a perfect storm for agriculture. The looming threats to food security demand transformative innovations in agriculture that will drive the second green revolution. Maize is the most economically important crop in the U.S providing food, feed and bioenergy to the global economy. It is also one of the most photosynthetically productive plants on the planet. This productivity is driven by biochemical and anatomical adaptations associated with C4 photosynthesis. One proposed grand challenge is to introduce C4 traits into C3 crops such as rice and many temperate grasses. A major conceptual breakthrough in the understanding of the development of C4 photosynthesis was realized through the discovery that a root endodermal cell fate module was co-opted to drive a leaf specific cellular differentiation program. Importantly, a prediction from this model suggests that a limited number of changes in genes could lead to a major reprogramming of leaf cell fates.  This project will test this prediction and expand on our understanding of the gene regulatory networks that drive both biochemical and anatomical innovations associated with C4 photosynthesis. The results of these studies will not only provide candidate genes for engineering C4 traits into C3 crops, but also provide novel targets for improvement of existing C4 crops such as maize, sugarcane and sorghum. With regard to training and outreach, the project will continue to expand on the MutantMillets outreach program at the DDPSC. MutantMillets provides teaching modules and teaching resources with hands-on activities in the plant sciences to engage high school students in the St. Louis metropolitan region. Importantly, all resources developed through this program will be portable to other school systems through the project website and through the educational networks established by the Education and Outreach Center at the DDPSC. Grasses that utilize C4 photosynthesis include maize, sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus.  C4 grasses use two distinct cell types to create a CO2 pump that elevates the levels of CO2 in the vicinity of the enzyme Rubisco, effectively eliminating wasteful photorespiration. Under hot, dry conditions C4 systems display significantly increased productivity relative to C3 crops such as rice and wheat. This project aims to identify the foundational genetic and regulatory networks that control the differentiation of the two photosynthetic cell types in maize - the bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M). This work expands on recent discoveries that has linked the SHR/SCR/IDD regulatory module to the differentiation of the BS and M cells of maize and provides new opportunities to more fully explore the function of this regulatory network in C4 grasses through an integrated systems biology approach. These studies will include the development and implementation of several emerging technologies including cell-type specific proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies, robotics-based yeast one hybrid screens, ChIP-seq, translatomics, X-ray computed tomography, novel informatics/network analysis algorithms, and modeling of both developmental phenotypes and mechanistic regulatory networks. All data and resources generated in this project will be made accessible to the public through the project website and through long-term repositories.

1038,"With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies, the genome sequences of over 80 different plant species are available with several hundreds to thousands of individual plants within a species currently being sequenced. While the genome sequences provide the  parts lists  for tens of thousands of protein-coding genes in each species, the vast majority of genes in most plant species remain to be functionally annotated, which has become a major bottleneck for the whole plant biology field. A prerequisite for any effort to determine the functions of proteins on a genome-wide scale requires the construction of a set or library of bacterial clones with inserts representing only the protein coding regions or open reading frames (ORFs) of genes.  These libraries are often referred to as an ORFeome.  A significant hurdle for constructing an ORFeome library is that tens of thousands of clones must be sequenced individually, making the process extremely labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive since next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies cannot be applied directly. This EAGER project aims to develop a massively parallel sequencing technology, called PLATE-seq (PCR mediated linkage of barcoded adapters to nucleic acid elements for sequencing), which will drastically increase the throughput and reduce the cost of large-scale sequencing efforts. As part of the proof-of-concept and to demonstrate the utility of PLATE-seq, the project will construct the first fully-sequenced single-colony rice (Oryza sativa, cv. Nipponbare) ORFeome library for ~3,000 genes. This EAGER project is interdisciplinary in nature and represents a mid-career reorientation of research interest into the field of plant science for the Principal Investigator, and will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors. All protocols will be accessible through publications, seminars, and training workshops. In addition, all ORF clones, E. coli and yeast strains, computational tools, and sequence data generated in association with this project will be made openly available.Next-generation sequencing technologies require mixing tens of thousands of samples together to be sequenced en masse. Multiplexing strategies offer a partial solution to the need to track individual samples, but can be prohibitively expensive when sequences need to be matched to thousands of individual samples, which is the case for constructing an ORFeome library. For this reason, large-scale Sanger sequencing, albeit extremely expensive, is still necessary for many such applications. The PLATE-seq platform is based on an innovative but unproven design which requires large-scale nested stitch PCRs from thousands of E. coli or yeast colonies where the use of ~150 bp double-stranded DNA as a primer in one of the steps can significantly decrease the PCR efficiency. If successful, PLATE-seq technology will completely replace the need for large-scale Sanger sequencing, predicted to improve sequencing efficiency of ORFeome libraries ~1,000-fold over existing multiplexing NGS approaches, and even more so compared to traditional Sanger sequencing. For this reason, PLATE-seq has tremendous implications not only for constructing ORFeome libraries, but also for many functional genomics and reverse proteomics applications where it is essential that sequencing reads be traced back to individual samples, or where associations between samples need to be tracked such as in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) or other genetic screens where pairs of DNA molecules are selected and identified.

1039,"This project investigates how environmental illnesses reconfigure the relationships between health, knowledge, and agricultural modernization. In recent years a mysterious and severe form of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) has emerged in several agricultural communities around the world. Those affected are predominantly young and middle aged male agricultural workers who do not suffer from the risk factors typically associated with kidney disease. While the exact cause of CKDu is still a source of scientific uncertainty, narratives that link the disease to the agrarian landscape have captivated popular imagination and influence farmers' cultivation practices, albeit in uneven, haphazard, and poorly understood ways. This project builds upon political ecology of health and science and technology studies (STS) to investigate how uncertainty about the cause of CKDu shapes health-environment interactions and agrarian landscapes and livelihoods. In doing so, it will account for the complex ways that farmers perceive and act on agricultural health risks while illuminating how contested understandings of environmental illnesses can fundamentally restructure agricultural practices, systems of production, and relations of expertise. Through this analysis, the proposed research will contribute directly to the development of policies and programs that facilitate agrarian livelihoods in the context of disease. Since the first reports of the emergence of a new form of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) in the early 1990s, Sri Lanka's once peripheral dry zone has become the epicenter of an epidemic that is slowly crippling agricultural communities across the island's rice belt. The proposed project focuses on three dimensions of the relationship between CKDu and agricultural practices to explain how this scientifically contested illness is remade into an agricultural problem, and with what effects. First, the project investigates how ideas about the environment and its links to disease are formed, reinforced, and circulated. Second, it evaluates how farmers' cultivation practices are changing in response to the problem of CKDu and documents their shifts to native rice varieties and also to organic - or chemical free - systems of production, albeit in spatially uneven and sometimes transitory ways. Additionally, this study investigates how uncertainty about CKDu's cause mediates farmers' interactions with the environment and shapes the uneven adoption of native seeds as disease management strategies. Finally, the project examines how relationships between health and agricultural modernization in the dry zone have changed over time and inform contemporary agrarian shifts in response to CKDu. The project integrates archival research, ethnographic methods, and household surveys to study two dry zone farming communities. Findings of this research will provide insights into how contested agri-environmental-health problems shape practices of disease management and give rise to new forms of agricultural production. While this research is anchored in an analysis of shifting agrarian livelihoods in CKDu endemic areas of Sri Lanka, its findings will be applicable to other geographic regions where parallel epidemics of mystery kidney disease are found in agricultural communities such as India, Egypt, and Central America.

1040,"This proposal is for a workshop directly related to the work being performed through an existing INSPIRE (Integrated NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education) award entitled  Modeling the Magnetic Interactions between Stars and Planets .  Currently, more than 1800 confirmed planetary systems beyond our solar system (i.e. extrasolar planets or exoplanets) have been discovered through ground and space-based astronomical techniques, with an additional 3600 candidate systems yet to be confirmed. These recent discoveries have resulted in dramatic growth in research related to the study of exoplanets with the ultimate objective being the discovery and characterization of habitable Earth-sized systems. The primary goal of the related INSPIRE project is to improve our understanding of the interactions between stars and their planets. The proposed interdisciplinary and international workshop will be held at the PIs institution, Rice University, to facilitate necessary discussions on the roles that magnetic fields play in the habitability of planets other than Earth.  The proposed workshop will enhance the work being performed by the INSPIRE project to apply techniques and methods drawn from the space physics community to the traditionally astrophysical research area of exoplanets. The project team has significant expertise in computational modeling of the magnetospheres of rocky planets like the Earth and gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. They will combine their magnetospheric code with available magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere in order to model interactions of the solar wind with planetary magnetospheres. A key aspect of the project is to apply these combined models to a much broader class of star-planet interactions by scaling the models to simulate a wide range of stellar parameters.  This interdisciplinary workshop will bring together solar and astro-physicists for unique discussions. These types of in person collaborations are essential for evolving the science and for growing the avenues of communication between the two disciplines. The proposed workshop is directly relevant to the INSPIRE project. It is ideally held at Rice University and led by the PI who is a world leader in this field.

1043,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have failed to fulfill long-held expectations of high-surface-area coupled with outstanding electronic properties.  This owes primarily to an inability to catalytically synthesize the nanotubes as single-walled entities in a patterned  chiral  (n,m)-structure; and is despite theoretical arguments by the principal investigator that such structures should be possible if the proper combination of catalyst, support and chemical vapor deposition conditions can be achieved.  Recently, experimental success in producing such chiral CNTs has been demonstrated.  The project will draw upon the experimental achievement to develop refined and expanded theoretical predictions that should guide further developments of catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) toward optimal catalytic materials and processing conditions.  The ability to produce single-wall carbon nanotubes of high purity at industrial scale could have profound effects on commercial applications of CNT technology, ideally with U.S. researchers leading the way.The project will evolve a critical recent breakthrough in the PI's group revealing that the origin of CNT chirality can be described by a set of guidelines that will aid design of catalysts for (n,m)-targeted CNT synthesis. The researchers now clearly recognize that this complex phenomenon lies at the intersection of two large and mature fields: heterogeneous catalysis and crystal growth. Bringing together these paradigms from chemistry and materials science is expected to result in a transformative theoretical framework that should enable finding ways to engineer chiral selective CNT production, thus advancing a variety of long-awaited applications, all pending availability of single (n,m) type material. This will be achieved by a comprehensive atomistic investigation of structure and energetics of various metal-nanoparticle catalysts combined with state-of-the-art quantitative analysis of the thermodynamics and kinetics of ruling processes at the catalyst-CNT interface. To enable a higher probability of significantly new understanding, hypotheses based on such microscopic results will be validated through a continuing comparison with experimental data in the literature and through contacts with several experimental labs.  The cross-disciplinary nature of the project will provide educational opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students in computational chemistry, molecular dynamics, and statistical physics.  Research results will be organized in a curated public materials property database.

1044,"This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry.This project investigates an enzyme (KatG) at the center of the chemical warfare that rages between pathogenic microorganisms and their plant/animal hosts. Hosts produce hydrogen peroxide as part of an elaborate microbial killing system, and many pathogens produce this enzyme to defend themselves. KatG-producing pathogens range from the rice-blast fungus, which annually costs billions of dollars in crop losses, to tuberculosis, which kills millions of people each year. Clearly, it is important to understand how KatG works. Such knowledge may provide a foundation for future interventions that make these pathogens more susceptible to their hosts' own defenses. This project provides research training for graduate and undergraduate students. Most importantly, it contributes to increasing success of at-risk students from underrepresented groups, minimizing their attrition from STEM majors and maximizing the likelihood they will complete their degrees. Finally, this research helps generate new STEM learning opportunities for Alabama prisoners by contributing material that excites interest and engages future participation of prisoners in STEM learning. Intramolecular electron transfer is central to all aspects of KatG catalysis, including formation of its methionine-tyrosine-tryptophan (MYW) cofactor, the use of the cofactor for catalysis, the accumulation of inactive intermediates, and return of those intermediates to activity by exogenous electron donors. However, the intermediates of these processes and their mechanisms of control are poorly defined. To address these unknowns, this project is divided into two parts. The first evaluates KatG already containing its MYW cofactor, and the second evaluates KatG prior to cofactor formation. The former will elucidate the intermediates necessary for active catalysis as well as those that lead to inactivation, whereas the latter will address the intermediates that lead to and detract from de novo MYW cofactor synthesis. In both cases, the mechanisms by which the KatG protein itself controls the routes of electron transfer will be addressed, as will the ability of exogenous electron donors to restore inactive intermediates. As such, a broad suite of paired kinetic and spectroscopic methods, from chemical-quench peptide mapping to freeze-quench Mossbauer spectroscopy, will be applied to KatG variants targeting the proximal tryptophan and/or the arginine switch.

1045,"Dr. Scott Maguffin has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at Cornell University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center. The goal of this project is to understand the process of arsenic bonding with organic compounds in the critical zone and limiting its mobility. Dr. Maguffin will use a combination of approaches, including geochemistry and environmental microbiology, to study arsenic-contaminated rice paddy soils. This research will complement ongoing efforts at the USDA Dale Bumpers Center to understand and mitigate arsenic uptake by rice plants. Insights into soil-mediated drivers of arsenic-organic compounds interactions will contribute to an integrated understanding of how soil-plant-microbe interactions regulate the bioavailability and toxicity of arsenic in rice paddy soils. Results from this study will also have implications for development of biovolatilization as a soil and groundwater remediation tool, since several forms of arsenic-organic compounds species are volatile. The research results will be shared through a joint seminar at the Dale Bumpers Center. Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to participate in the research, and outreach events related to arsenic in water and food will be organized, ensuring a high level of student and community engagement with this project and the field of arsenic biogeochemistry.Arsenic methylation, a microbial detoxification process in which microbes catalyze the formation of a family of methylated arsenic species, significantly changes the toxicity, mobility, and fate of arsenic in the critical zone. The working hypothesis for this study is that microbially-driven demethylation competes with methylation to return arsenic to inorganic forms, and thus acts as a  cryptic  process that suppresses the accumulation of methylated arsenic in the environment. The investigation will use laboratory experiments to characterize the methylation potential of microbial communities from the different ecosystems through molecular biomarker analyses of microbial abundance and activity, as well as through chemical analyses. Functional gene analyses with newly designed  universal  arsM primers will produce a new level of knowledge of the diversity, abundance, and activity of As-methylating microbes in critical zone environments with different geochemical properties.

1046,"This project supports a conference on  Humans, Machines, and the Future of Work  to be held at Rice University, in Houston, TX. The conference will focus on issues created by the impact of information technology on labor markets over the next 25 years, addressing questions such as: What advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and automation are expected over the next 25 years? What will be the impact of these advances on job creation, job destruction, and wages in the labor market? What skills are required for the job market of the future? How can education prepare workers for that job market? What educational changes are needed? What economic and social policies are required to integrate people whose skills do not match the needs of future labor markets? How can social mobility in such an environment be preserved and increased? The conference will feature 16 renowned speakers and panelists from academia, industry and leading think tanks with expertise in technology, economics, social sciences, and the humanities. The goal of the conference is to start a conversation between many academic disciplines on the future of work in order to make this topic a subject of ongoing academic inquiry, as well as a subject of public policy discussion.The current understanding of the Information Technology Revolution is somewhat similar to the 1970s' understanding of global warming. Facts are known with some level of certainty.  Computers are eliminating some jobs involving structured tasks in manufacturing, clerical work, and some other mid-skill occupations.  At the same time,  computers are creating new jobs in many other occupations, particularly for technically skilled people. Beyond these facts lies a broad landscape of speculation.  Not much is known about the Information Technology Revolution's net effect on employment and wages. Equally important, not much is known about the speed at which the revolution is proceeding.  To the extent this uncertainty can be reduced, it will require a joint effort by computer scientists, economists, sociologists, psychologists, and others. Addressing these issues is an important national challenge.

1047,"PI: Blake C. Meyers (University of Delaware)CoPIs: Virginia Walbot (Stanford University) and Greg Abrams (Texas Advanced Computing Center/University of Texas - Austin) Information generated from this project will provide new insights into the regulation of developmental events in the anther, the male reproductive organ, of maize and related grasses - crops that feed much of the world.  New insights and resources of broad utility should ultimately contribute to controlling plant fertility in agriculture, particularly in the cereal crops. The project builds and improves on the varied and extensive outreach and education components of the PIs and their contributions via scientific leadership to continue a strong, positive impact on local and scientific communities, and on the next generation of scientists. Implementation of the  Virtual Anther  will make the project data widely accessible while helping students and the public understand how anthers develop. An undergraduate-focused project to sequence and annotate a basal grass genome will provide invaluable data for the project and to all those employing phylogenomics analysis in flowering plants, while training the next generation of plant biologists. All project outcomes will be accessible to the research community through a project website and long-term repositories such as GEO and MaizeGDB. All biological resources such as antibodies, clones and vectors will be available upon request. Seed will be deposited and distributed long-term through the Maize Genetics Cooperative. Software for the  Virtual Anther  will be made open-source and available via the Texas Advanced Computing Center website (https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-software/).Male sterility is a common phenotype in natural species, functioning as one mechanism to promote outcrossing. Furthermore, control of pollen production by plant breeders is a fundamental technology that continues to underpin hybrid seed production in many crops. In the agricultural context, there is also a growing concern over climate disruption: both heat and cold cause male sterility in crop plants. This study seeks to more broadly understand the coordination of anther development and underlying cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, as plant cells switch from mitosis to meiosis.  The specific goals are to: (1) organize hierarchies of gene expression in individual anther cell types and (2) elucidate functions of small RNAs, particularly two unusual classes of  phased  secondary small RNAs (phasiRNAs) that are highly enriched in grass anthers. These phasiRNAs are processed from an extensive set of coordinately-expressed long non-coding RNA precursors into secondary small RNAs of 21 or 24 nucleotides. Using precisely staged maize anthers and laser microdissected cell types, the project will generate copious transcriptomic and proteomic data, organize transcriptional hierarchies of transcription factors, generate extensive data on small RNAs in a spatiotemporal context, and analyze the function and biogenesis of phasiRNAs. Genetic analysis using existing and engineered mutations will be used to test for essential roles of key transcription and phasiRNA biogenesis factors in anther development. Genetic and  omics  experiments will test new hypotheses about phasiRNA functions in anther cells and in meiosis. Most of the analysis will be conducted in maize because of its exquisite developmental regularity, the large size and ease of anther dissection, and existing molecular and genetic knowledge about maize anthers. Key insights will be evaluated in rice to distinguish general and species-specific points, with additional comparisons to other grasses. To generate new hypotheses, all data will be integrated into a  Virtual Anther  visualization system.

1048,"The costs of degrading cellulosic biomass currently impede its widespread use as a competitive domestic renewable alternative to fossil fuels. A promising route to renewable liquid fuels is the conversion of various biomass sources by microbial organisms. The goal for this project is to develop a basic understanding of the genes that control biomass accumulation. This will enable our long-term goal of producing ecologically and economically sustainable sources of feedstocks for biofuels. The research specifically addresses the genes that regulate a key aspect of plant growth, which is the creation of cell walls. In specific cells the walls are very thick and it is these that account for the bulk of all plant biomass. Grasses include many of our most important food and forage crops including maize, wheat, rice, ryegrass, and tall fescue. Despite the importance of the plant cell wall for plant growth, our knowledge of the precise regulatory mechanisms that give rise to the coordinated synthesis of the wall polymers is limited. This is especially true of grasses. This project will provide interdisciplinary training in development, genetics, genomics, and biochemistry for at least two University of Massachusetts graduate students and facilitate an internship program with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.This proposal aims at understanding the transcription networks that regulate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in grasses. The cell wall is a complex composite of polysaccharides, proteins, and lignin. Much of what is currently understood about the transcriptional regulation of cell wall biosynthesis is from the study of Arabidopsis thaliana xylem vessels and fibers, yet this understanding may not be generalizable across land plants. The cell walls of grasses, including domesticated cereals that provide the majority of human calories and the perennials under development as biofuel energy crops, differ significantly in morphology and composition from the eudicot A. thaliana. The research will explore the function of three Brachypodium distachyon transcription factors: GRASS NAC REPRESSOR OF FLOWERING (GNRF), WALL REGULATOR INTERACTING bHLH (WRIB), KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX OF BRACHYPODIUM DISTACHYON7 (KNOB7). The researchers hypothesize that these proteins regulate wall biosynthesis through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that make-up a system of feed forward and negative feedback loops that are influenced by external cues.  Transcription factors will be characterized by using methods such as chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine the gene promoter targets of the proteins and the effect of binding on cell wall biosynthesis. Protein-protein interactions will be evaluated using co-immunoprecipitation. A possible role for photo and thermocycles in the function of cell wall regulation will be tested by measuring function under varying time course conditions in plants of different mutant backgrounds.

1050,"This project explores a key part of the amazing molecular circuitry that governs how a seed develops into a whole plant, and addresses a major gap in our understanding of how dynamic motions in the molecular world can influence the shape of a living organism.  In rice, a specific signal-responsive molecular circuit has been identified that controls the formation of lateral roots that branch off of the main vertical root. This research project will investigate relationships between the sprouting of lateral roots and the rate of a specific molecular switch that regulates the timing of this circuit, thereby linking this molecular rate to the formation of the mature plant. These investigations will foster training of graduate and undergraduate students across multidisciplinary fields, and will be incorporated into a graduate level course on protein structure and function.  Importantly, a series of four learning modules that incorporate this scientific research will be produced and then disseminated via the vast network of 4-H chapters across New York state that reaches approximately 189,000 youth in regions that include low-income rural and American Indian populations. The primary potential societal impacts are to train young scientists in an exciting area of investigation, to contribute key insights into how molecular motions govern the development of whole organisms, and to stimulate interest in scientific exploration in youth who otherwise might not be exposed to concepts that span from molecules to plants. The overall goal of this project is to quantitatively investigate the role of a specific prolyl cis-trans molecular switch that acts as a timing device in an auxin-responsive transcription regulatory circuit that governs lateral root development in rice. The specific goals are to tune the molecular switching rate using gene editing, to measure induced changes in rate using NMR spectroscopy, to quantify the resulting changes in circuit dynamics in single cells using confocal fluorescence microscopy, and to observe corresponding changes in phenotype in the whole organism. The results of these experiments will be used to establish a quantitative mathematical model for prediction of the effects of this cis-trans switching rate on cellular dynamics, with impact on phenotype. The potentially transformative aspect of the project is that if successful, it will integrate knowledge across the scales from motions of individual bonds, to the dynamics of a molecular circuit that regulates gene transcription in a single cell, to a well-defined phenotype (i.e.,  genotype-to-phenotype ). This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics and Systems and Synthetic Biology Clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.

1051,"Biological processes at all scales from molecules to ecosystems are coordinated through the encoding, exchange, and interpretation of information. Many of the recent advances in the biological sciences collect very large sets of DNA (genotype) and protein sequence: making sense of how their properties lead to the appearance, responses and behaviors (phenotype) of organisms requires new computational tools. Linking the genotype to the phenotype requires untangling very complicated relationships. Collecting large amounts of data for large numbers of samples means developing new tools for data processing and data modeling.  This project will develop computational tools to address both of these challenges, while investigating the effects of salt tolerance in rice. Large sets of expression data will be collected along with images of the developing plants from several imaging technologies. The images will be used to produce 3D reconstructions of the plant architecture that can be stored as digital phenotypes. It is expected that these digital phenotypes will allow plant breeders to identify traits that were not captured by standard observation methods, and find new genotype-phenotype associations. The educational activities are timely, providing training opportunities for plant biology and computer science students. As the volumes of image-derived digital data surge, image informatics is emerging as a cutting-edge discovery tool. Outreach and training activities include a summer workshop for plant phenomics and establishing a data visualization community at University of Nebraska. Project resources will be released on CyVerse to ensure wide availability. High-throughput sequencing technology- driven transcriptome analyses are a commonly utilized approach for gaining molecular insights on an organism's response to environmental changes. These transcriptome-level responses and the underlying regulatory gene networks that drive phenotypic responses to changing environment are highly dynamic. With the advent of high-throughput image-based plant phenotyping, it is now possible to capture the dynamics of growth and other digital-features responding to environmental or genetic perturbation with increased temporal and spatial resolution. This project will use temporal imaging to inform the collection of time series transcriptome data with 3D-spatial sensitivity for discovering dynamic regulatory co-expression networks. Outcomes of the project will be to develop innovative algorithms to integrate heterogeneous datasets and implement it in a prototype computational framework. The platform will enable interactive, multidimensional visualization of dynamic regulatory networks with spatial and temporal resolution.

1052,"Postdoctoral Fellow: Karan J. OdomProposal Number: 1612861This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to engage in research and training that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Karan J. Odom is  Investigating elaborate trait evolution in female and male song across songbirds.  The host institution for this fellowship is Cornell University and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Mike Webster, Irby Lovette and Aaron Rice.The goal of this project is to reconstruct and understand the evolution of elaborate bird song in female and male songbirds. Bird song, an elaborate acoustic trait, is often thought to have evolved primarily in males to gain access to mates. However, previous research shows that female song is widespread in songbirds and has been lost in certain major lineages. Therefore, song likely evolved early in female and male songbirds and the current male-female differences in song must have resulted at least in part from the evolutionary loss of song in females. The fellow is using bird song recordings from the extensive collection of the Cornell University's Macaulay Library, to determine how song structure has changed over time in both males and females. The Fellow is developing quantitative methods to allow male and female song to be compared on a phylogenetic tree, assessing how gains and losses of song structure contribute to dimorphism, and comparing song dimorphism to a broad range of ecological and natural history correlates.The Fellow is receiving training that supports her career goal to obtain a university faculty position in which she can develop an innovative and dynamic research program on the evolution of complex animal communication. The use of existing collections and other resources available through Cornell?s Lab of Ornithology (CLO) allows the Fellow to build strong computational bioacoustic and phylogenetic skills while conducting cutting-edge research within her field. The Fellow is also implementing a substantial outreach and citizen science component to promote use of biological collections. The Fellow is developing materials for observing and recording female song that are being disseminated through a project website that links to Macaulay and CLO?s resources for citizen scientists. She is also writing popular articles for wildlife magazines and participating in recording workshops to educate volunteer recordists and wildlife enthusiasts. Finally, the Fellow is also promoting involvement of girls in STEM by participating in local science fairs and career days.

1053,"Finger millet is a grain crop of strategic importance to food security in Eastern Africa.  The grain has high nutritional value, can grow in arid environments and thus is important to the livelihood of smallholder farmers.  A major agricultural goal in the region is to develop higher yielding varieties of finger millet through reducing or eliminating diseases that impact growth of the plant.  Blast fungus is a pathogen that reduces yield up to 80% and is one of the main diseases affecting finger millet. To understand how to control disease outbreaks, this project uses genomic sequencing as a powerful approach to identify precise strains of the fungus and to study how the fungus causes disease symptoms in the plant. Sequence analyses of blast strains collected in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia will provide information on the genetic diversity of the pathogen in Eastern Africa, and provide a resource to identify the factors that are responsible for infection of finger millet. The knowledge from this approach is essential to develop efficient disease management strategies. Furthermore, sequence analyses of the finger millet host will clarify why some cultivars are more resistant to blast than others. The generated resources will also be used as a vehicle to train undergraduate and graduate students in Eastern Africa in bioinformatics, an expertise that is essential to translate the information to improve breeding strategies.  The specific aims of the project are to (1) Generate 80X PacBio sequence for the allotetraploid finger millet genome (1C=1.8 Gb) to generate a high quality genome assembly (1C=1.8 Gb); (2) Resequence 200 Eastern African isolates of the finger millet blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, including 24 that were collected 10 years ago, to determine the diversity and evolution of this finger millet pathogen both over time and across geographic regions. The blast genome sequences will be mined to identify candidate effector genes using an effector prediction pipeline that incorporates common characteristics of known effectors (secretion and high polymorphism levels;(3) Analyze the blast-finger millet interaction transcriptome using RNA-Seq to identify genes that are induced at early stages of infection. Genes encoding secreted proteins will be identified from the RNA-Seq experiment and cross-referenced to those identified using the effector prediction pipeline. Host genes that are differentially expressed will be compared between compatible and incompatible interactions, and with genes that are differentially expressed during early stages of blast infection in rice, and(4) Develop a nested association mapping panel of some 4000 RILs derived from 21 diverse parents using a double round robin design.

1054,"1605564 Xu, Jianfeng    With increasing needs for high-value protein-based therapeutics, plant cells offer a safe and cost-effective alternative bioproduction platform. However, low protein productivity is a common bottleneck in the commercialization of this technology. This project engineers plant cells to express foreign proteins that are secreted into the cell culture medium.  This is advantageous as the protein is now sequestered from intracellular proteolytic degradation and can be readily recovered and purified.  Fundamental knowledge gained from this research will advance our understanding of plant development, stress defense, and plant cell wall assembly. This is a highly interdisciplinary research project that will present unique learning opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students at Arkansas State University.The overall goal of this project is to leverage a designer molecular carrier engineering technology in developing a commercially competitive plant cell-based bioproduction platform for high-value proteins. Specifically, this project aims to exploit the unique plant Hyp-O-glycosylation 'code' that precisely directs the O-glycosylation of a proline-rich peptide, to develop novel Hyp-O-glycosylated peptides (HypGPs) that function as a molecular carrier in excreting conjoined heterologous proteins to cell culture media. The PIs will test the hypothesis that strategically designed HypGP carriers can function to improve plant cell culture productivity by boosting the secretion of several model proteins and stabilizing these products in culture media. The precise Hyp-O-glycosylation process in tobacco BY-2 cells, and the key mechanisms facilitating protein secretion will be dissected.  Based on the outcome of this study, optimal HypGP design in terms of peptide sequence and chain length to achieve the highest protein yields will be established. In order to assess the practical and broader applications of the designer HypGPs for expressing larger and complex therapeutic proteins, expression of two distinct and therapeutically promising proteins, human alfa1-antitrypsin (52 kDa) and interleukin-12 (70 kDa) will be tested. Additionally, broader applicability of Hyp-O-glycosylation 'code' to engineering functional designer HypGPs in monocot rice cell culture will be investigated towards advancing our understanding about the Hyp-O-glycosylation in monocot plants and achieving high protein productivity in rice cell culture.This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

1055,"Fusion of the maternal and paternal gametes forms the zygote, and it marks the initiation of a new plant from a single cell. This is a critical stage in the life cycle of the plant. Extensive reprogramming of the pattern of gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA and associated proteins, also known as epigenetic processes, accompany zygote development.  Previous studies have shown that the large-scale activation of plant zygotic genes occurs earlier than it does in animals; however, both the timing and the relative contributions of the maternal and paternal genetic material to zygotic gene activation are not well defined. Furthermore, a detailed characterization of the reprogramming and activation of the zygotic genome at the earliest stages has not been performed in a flowering plant due to the difficulties in isolating single-cell zygotes at precise time points during early development.  This project will characterize genome-wide changes mediated by epigenetic mechanisms in zygotes from rice, an important crop plant. This study will address the early stages of zygote development starting at fertilization, and will utilize the latest technical advances in the isolation and molecular analysis of single cells. Understanding the formation of zygotes from gametes has agricultural applications for increased seed yields, for regeneration of plants from tissue culture, and for improved methods of breeding hybrids.  The project will also provide training in plant biology and genomics to students and faculty from Langston University, a historically African-American institution in Oklahoma.Rice is an excellent model to study the mechanisms associated with genome reprograming during zygote genome activation. Rice has one of the shortest time from pollination to fertilization among flowering plants, a characteristic that makes feasible the isolation of precisely-staged zygotes for analysis. Epigenetic processes in zygotic genome activation will be elucidated by characterization of the small RNA transcriptomes and methylomes of the male and female gametes, and of zygotes derived from self-pollinated as well as hybrid crosses. The aims include identification of micro RNAs targeting maternal transcripts, short interfering RNAs targeting transposons for silencing, and potentially novel small RNAs involved in zygotic chromatin resetting. Loci with uniparental zygotic expression will be investigated for transmission or erasure of methylation marks. The analysis will incorporate mutants affecting RNA-dependent methylation pathways. The datasets will be used to generate models for parent-of-origin expression in embryogenesis, as well as for silencing of transposable elements and establishment of constitutive heterochromatic domains through the germline.  The project outcomes will result in the closure of major gaps in the understanding of a fundamental transition in the life cycle of plants.

1056,"At the dawn of agriculture, our ancestors harvested wild grains and began replanting them year after year. This process rapidly led to selection for grains that stayed on the plant, instead of falling on the ground. Now, 10,000 years later, this capacity to stay on the plant until harvest has obvious economic importance. The change from wild grains that fall and cultivated ones that do not is caused by naturally occurring mutations in a normal (that is wild) process. However, the process of shedding seeds occurs differently in different grains. For example, the details of dropping seeds in wild rice are different from those in wild sorghum or wild millet. This project will discover what natural mutations led to the cultivated grains, and whether the natural process of shedding seeds in rice, sorghum, and millet is genetically similar. Because retaining seeds on the plant is the very basis of agriculture, it is an obvious aspect of plants that can engage students at all education levels. Master teachers and undergraduate education majors at Oklahoma State University, as well as undergraduate science majors and local high school students, will participate actively in the observations and data collection required for the project.Shedding of seeds occurs via a characteristic zone of weakness, the abscission zone (AZ), in which the contents of cells and cell walls are modified to allow a fruit to fall off the parent plant. This project will test whether development is generally conservative, i.e., whether the AZ is produced by activating a conserved developmental program at different times or in different locations, or whether development produces novel structures (in this case, the AZ) by using novel gene combinations. Specifically, recombinant inbred lines and wild accessions will be used to identify genes that contribute to shattering in the model species green millet (Setaria viridis). These studies will be complemented by transcriptomic data on green millet in comparison to Brachypodium distachyon and rice. These investigations will test the hypothesis that some aspects of AZ development are shared among the three species but that many aspects differ because the AZ forms in a different position in each. The investigation will then be expanded to many other grasses, some of which are similar to millet, rice and Brachypodium, and some of which show distinct patterns of seed shedding.

1058,"The seed of flowering plants contains two very important structures: the embryo that will become a seedling and eventually grow into the mature plant, and the endosperm, a tissue that provides nutrients to the embryo as it grows. If you have eaten rice, you have eaten endosperm, the starchy portion that fills the majority of the rice grain. Since the emergence of agriculture, humans have selected and bred seeds with a larger and starchier endosperm portion, ultimately creating the crop varieties we now depend upon. Endosperm, either directly or indirectly through animal feed, now provides an estimated 67% of the calories consumed by humans worldwide, and improving on these varieties remains of fundamental importance. Thus, from both an agricultural and food security perspective the development of the endosperm is critical to humankind's survival.  This research will investigate the genes that control endosperm development and the molecular and evolutionary interactions between the endosperm and the embryo in the monkey flower (genus Mimulus). Although not eaten by humans, due to its ecological and evolutionary history, Mimulus provides a unique opportunity to study evolutionary and molecular aspects of the interactions between endosperm and embryo.  As these interactions regulate the growth of the endosperm and thus the size of the nutritious portion of the seed in agricultural varieties, the results of this research in Mimulus are expected to engender a molecular understanding of a developmental process critical to human agricultural productivity.Recent evidence links the evolutionary theory of parent-offspring conflict over maternal resources to the evolution of epigenetically imprinted genes controlling normal seed endosperm development. In interploidy hybrids, dosage-sensitivity of paternal and maternal allelic expression in developing endosperm is critical to normal development, and disruption leads to seed abortion. As yet it remains unknown whether such conflict over embryo provisioning leads to evolutionary divergence of imprinted genes or their targets, and ultimately hybrid seed lethality, in diploid species. The investigators propose to test this possibility by determining the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanisms underlying species divergence in endosperm development and leading to hybrid seed abortion, a principal isolating barrier in the Mimulus guttatus sp. complex. This research integrates genomic, molecular genetic and developmental biology approaches, utilizing high-throughput genome mapping, RNA sequencing technologies, and transgenic techniques to elucidate the genetic mechanisms contributing to seed abortion in M. guttatus x M. nudatus crosses. In so doing, it examines questions of fundamental interest to evolutionary biologists (how are new species formed?), and to developmental biologists (how is endosperm growth regulated?) while addressing a question of interest to both: what molecular changes might rapidly evolve when the mother's need to regulate growth and development differs from that of her offspring?

1060,"This REU Site award to Rice University, located in Houston, TX, will support the training of ten students for ten weeks during the summers of 2016-2018. This REU site seeks to expose students to the excitement of biological research and the increasing contributions that different science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines are making towards a detailed understanding of biological systems. To achieve this, students will work in labs that draw from an array of approaches - from classical biochemical and genetic to non-trivial theoretical modeling that requires computation. The research areas include: (i) biomolecular structure, function, and evolution, (ii) naturally-occurring genetic networks, (iii) synthetic genetic and metabolic networks, and (iv) ecological networks. The participating faculty mentors come from a range of departments including Biosciences, Bioengineering, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Chemistry, and Computer Science. In addition to research, students will participate in workshops that focus on ethics and responsible conduct of research, professional communication, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process. In addition to presenting their research at a capstone poster symposium, students will be provided a creative opportunity to develop innovative biotechnology proposal ideas by working in collaborative groups.It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will be recruited nationwide, with an emphasis on students enrolled at proximal minority-serving institutions, including community colleges and four-year institutions. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available at http://ibb.rice.edu/Content.aspx?id=563, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Joff Silberg at joff@rice.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. George Bennett at gbennett@rice.edu).

1061,"This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Danelle Seymour is  Exploring the causes and consequences of rapid transposon evolution in grass genomes  The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Irvine and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Brandon Gaut.The most economically important crop species, including rice, maize, wheat, and barley are members of the grass family. The genomes of these species are extremely variable in size, and this is largely the result of rapid proliferation of mobile genetic elements, or transposons. While the genomic distribution of transposons in each species has been reported, the evolutionary forces that shape rapid, global changes in their distributions are unknown. This project aims to characterize the evolutionary forces that drive large changes in genome structure in eight grass species and whether such changes also have functional consequences. This project will provide the fellow with an evolutionary perspective important for connecting basic genomics research to plant phenotype, as well as the opportunity to provide long-term mentoring to undergraduates interested in genomics research.Transposons are insertional mutagens and host genomes have evolved mechanisms to mitigate their spread. Transposon silencing can reduce transcription of flanking endogenous genes, but the duration of these changes is unclear due to the rapid evolution of inserted sequences. Exploring the interplay between these two forces, transposon proliferation and host silencing of transposition, is central to understanding how plant genomes evolve. This research aims to characterize the extent that transposon proliferation impacts the evolution of host genomes and ultimately the host phenotype using a comparative phylogenetic approach focusing on eight grass species. First, a unified framework for transposon identification and annotation in all eight species will be developed which will serve as an important community resource. Next, this resource will be used to characterize the role of transposons in the evolution of gene expression. Using a phylogenetic approach, it is possible to characterize the duration of transposon-induced phenotypic changes, in this case gene expression, and the extent that such changes shape the evolution of gene expression networks in this important plant family.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Kevin Potter is  Uncovering the transcriptional and genomic dynamics of cytokinin signaling in rice . The host institution for the fellowship is the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Joseph Kieber.Cytokinins are plant hormones that are known to regulate various aspects of growth and development and other physiological processes in plants. The overarching goal of the project is to gain a deeper understanding into how cytokinin regulates these processes by using an integrative transcriptomic and genomic approach to build a dynamic model of the cytokinin response in rice. These new insights may provide new effective strategies to engineer this signaling pathway to modify various agronomical traits in rice needed to meet the future food supply and demand. The broader impacts of the project consist of training undergraduate and graduate students, assisting the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center with a series of workshops designed for UNC graduate students, and participating in the North Carolina DNA Day, which is an annual event where North Carolina researchers from various institutions advocate careers in science and biotechnology and give biology lessons to high schools throughout North Carolina. Training objectives include acquiring expertise with new transcriptomic and genomics methods, and bioinformatics tools.This project seeks to: 1) kinetically characterize the transcriptional and open chromatin profiles using RNA-Seq and formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq), respectively, in response to cytokinins in shoots and roots in rice; 2) integrate these datasets, build dynamic models for the cytokinin response, and identify cis-acting regulatory elements by utilizing a variety of bioinformatics tools; and 3) adapt assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) for use in rice and then use this method in conjunction with RNA-Seq to build dynamic tissue-specific cytokinin response models in the shoot and root meristems in rice. These models will be tested and validated in future studies by altering different modules and components to ascertain their specific function in the cytokinin signaling pathway and effects on agronomical traits in rice. The collected sequencing datasets will be made available at the Sequence Read Archive at NCBI.

1063,"Blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is the most serious disease of cultivated rice and a global food security threat that annually results in a 10-30% reduction in worldwide rice yields. M. oryzae is also emerging as a major pathogen of wheat. During rice infection, dome-shaped fungal cells called appressoria form on the surface of the rice leaf and access the underlying epidermal cells. Remarkably, fungal growth in living rice cells, called biotrophy, occurs for the first days of infection without activating the robust plant defenses that normally work to keep the host plant disease-free. Yet, despite the fundamental importance of this biotrophic growth stage to crop health, little is known about how plant defense suppression and fungal growth is integrated in host cells. To address these knowledge gaps, this proposal asks: How do fungal cells thrive in rice cells? To answer this, research will be directed towards characterizing mutants of M. oryzae that are impaired in their ability to colonize rice cells in order to unlock the fundamental cellular, biochemical, and genetic regulatory mechanisms that govern the rice-fungus interaction. This work could point to much needed robust and sustainable mitigation strategies and shed light on fundamental growth processes in fungi. The proposed work will foster the molecular training of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds through active participation in tackling the real-world problem of rice blast disease.By addressing the fundamental question  What molecular mechanisms coordinate sustained fungal growth and plant defense suppression in the host cell?  This project aims to resolve substantial issues in plant pathology regarding the processes by which fungal pathogens thrive in plant cells. The stated objectives will use forward and reverse genetics, genome-wide proteomic and metabolic approaches, and live-cell imaging to define key exploitable differences in the metabolism of M. oryzae compared to host rice cells. This could lead to the development of novel crop protection strategies targeting molecular pathways that are critical for the biotrophic growth of the fungus but are not required for the normal function of the host cell, and could shed new light on the basic principles of cell growth. The educational objective will expand scientific education by stimulating undergraduates' science learning, preparing graduate students for scientific life beyond the university, and inspiring scientific interest in minority high school students.

1064,"This significant project will fund thirteen additional participants to the successful Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP) for STEM majors at Rice University. The program is designed to meet the needs of talented students whose preparation leaves them at risk of attrition. The program is comprehensive in its attack on the barriers to persistence with activities that focus on academic preparation for college and navigational skills in college. It provides students with a challenging and immersive bridge experience focusing on the most difficult topics a student will face within their first semesters, followed by mentoring and at least two years of intensive advising.                            All thirteen participants will have high potential, substantial financial need, and the vast majority will be from under-represented groups. This funding will greatly increase the chance that these students will major in STEM disciplines and then later graduate into leadership in the sciences and engineering. Spillover effects to the broader URM and first-generation collegian population include the creation of a visible supportive community of engaged young STEM scholars. The investigators will study the effectiveness of this non-remedial comprehensive program and its elements in overcoming obstructions to persistence by comparing RESP students to a non-RESP control group. The study will examine academic outcomes such as course grades, STEM attrition, and study skills and attitudinal outcomes such as STEM self-efficacy and career interest. The research planned comprises qualitative interviews about the college experience, quantitative longitudinal assessment of academic achievement, and quantitative longitudinal assessment of STEM attitudes and study skills using survey methodology. Research results will be disseminated broadly to the academic community in STEM education and learning sciences. The results will be scalable and exportable to inform the development of interventions at other universities in which underprepared high potential students attempt the difficult transition from high school to college.

1065,"The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is awarded a CAREER grant for the PI Michael Schatz to develop new computational methods for processing DNA sequencing data from the latest high-throughput sequencing technologies. DNA sequencing costs and throughput have improved by orders of magnitudes over the last three decades, although many questions remain unsolved, especially because of the short sequence lengths currently available. Emerging  third generation  sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences, Moleculo, Oxford Nanopore, and other companies are poised to revolutionize genomics by enabling the sequencing of long, individual molecules of DNA and RNA. The sequence lengths with these technologies can reach up to tens of thousands of nucleotides, however few or no analysis packages are capable of dealing with these types of genetic sequence data. This project will overcome these limitations by developing several novel analysis algorithms specifically for long read single molecule sequencing and their associated complex error models. The outcomes will help answer biological questions of profound significance to all of society, such as: What were the genetic implications of the domestication of rice? What genes and regulatory elements give rise to the incredible regenerative properties of the flatworm? or, What can be understood from assembling reference genomes of sugarcane and pineapple towards breeding more robust plant crops and biofuels?Specific objectives of the research include working towards assembling entire plant and animal chromosomes into complete, haplotype-phased sequences; identifying fusion genes and complex alternative splicing patterns responsible for diseases or adaptability; and searching for structural variations associated with improved crop yield or human diseases such as cancer or autism. Even if some future technology is capable of directly reading entire transcripts or entire genomes, this research will remain necessary to examine the higher level relationships across populations of genomes or in measuring the dynamics of gene expression and splicing.This project will tightly integrate research and education, promoting opportunities at high school through postdoctoral levels with the development of new course materials, hands-on research opportunities, and one-on-one mentoring experiences. This effort will specifically target the intersection of computer science and biology, promoting interdisciplinary education, and ensuring the next generation of scientists are ready for the complexities of quantitative and digital biology. To engage the widest possible audience, Dr Schatz  will also develop novel online teaching materials made available through a yearly bioinformatics contest. The first round of the contest reached nearly 1000 students around the world and at all levels of education, engaging students far beyond our physical limits. The products of the research will be made available as open-source software, and installed into the graphical iPlant Discovery Environment making them easily accessible to the large community of plant researcher around the world.

When cowpea is combined with starchy grains such as corn, sorghum or rice, the result is a complete source of major nutrients for energy and growth. It also provides protein-rich leaves and is used for animal feed.  Cowpea is the primary source of protein for people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where it is presently produced on over 20 million acres mainly by farmers with small land holdings. Its popularity is also due to its resilience to low rainfall and heat while also enriching the soil. Despite its relevance to food security in Africa and elsewhere, there has been relatively little basic research on cowpea. Advances in next generation sequencing technology have made it possible to  read  the genetic material of cowpea and decipher the instructions (genes and genetic variation) that ultimately provide for crop improvement.  Producing an optimized reference genome sequence for cowpea is one of the main goals of this project, a feat that has been accomplished for human, mouse, cow and economically important crop plants such as corn, soybean, rice, bean and poplar. A broader purpose is to provide genetic resources to improve decision-making abilities within an existing network of African cowpea breeders. Breeders develop new varieties by making crosses between parents that carry favorable traits and selecting progeny containing favorable characteristics of both parents. This project will provide new materials for progeny selection in addition to knowledge that will facilitate the development of new cowpea varieties for increased food production. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is in the family Fabaceae, tribe Phaseoleae which includes other warm season legumes such as soybean, common bean and pigeon pea, as well as Vigna species adzuki bean and mung bean. Cowpea is diploid with 2n=22 chromosomes and a genome size of 620 Mb. Unlike other legumes, cowpea lacks a published reference genome. A highly fragmented draft genome sequence assembly has been available from previous work since 2011 (harvest-blast.org; harvest-web.org) and is derived from 60x short-reads combined with BAC-end and gene survey Sanger sequences. This project will elevate the sequence of cowpea to state-of-the art by: (1) adding long-read sequences and an optical map; (2) anchoring contigs to a recently developed genetic map containing 37,372 SNPs; and (3) improving browser access for the broader legume community. This will enable deeper utilization of cowpea germplasm for gene discovery and marker development, while providing a stronger foundation for the cowpea genetics and breeding community. Genetic intercrosses will be conducted to produce new pre-breeding lines that will theoretically carry optimal combinations of traits present within elite lines using a recently developed multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population based on eight parental lines. Marker-trait information, in the context of the genome sequence and haplotypes, will be disseminated for broad adoption of marker-informed breeding.

1067,"The ability to detect and respond to stress is central to a plant's survival in a host of unfavorable environments and a key determinant of agricultural productivity under sub-optimal field conditions. Although a number of pathways have been described that confer specific protection to various abiotic and biotic challenges, a recent discovery of a potentially universal protective mechanism involving the Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier (SUMO) may transform the current appreciation of stress biology. Specifically, it has been shown that the Arabidopsis SUMO polypeptide becomes covalently attached to numerous nuclear proteins and that the levels of these conjugates rise rapidly and reversibly after exposing plants to various abiotic stresses. Using novel quantitative proteomic approaches, it has been discovered that many of the SUMOylation targets are known critical regulators with their collective functions implying that SUMO addition engages a protective response that broadly alters chromatin accessibility, transcription, and mRNA processing/export.  Taken together, these results suggest that SUMO might offer unique opportunities to globally manipulate the stress response for agricultural benefit. Unfortunately, the organization and functions of the SUMO system are largely unknown in other plant species, including all important agricultural crops, thus precluding rational redesign to improve crop plant productivity. Moreover, preliminary genome analyses of maize and rice revealed that the organization of the SUMO system in cereals might differ significantly from that in observed in Arabidopsis. This EAGER project proposes to define how SUMOylation works during stress in crops using maize (Zea mays) as the model. The specific aims are to: (i) delineate the SUMOylation system in maize using bioinformatic and biochemical methods and define kinetically how the system responds to stress; (ii) generate a library of maize mutants and transgenic lines affecting key components required for SUMO addition and release; (iii) define the  SUMOylome  of maize, quantify how the SUMOylation status of individual targets changes during stress and after recovery; and (iv) analyze SUMO pathway mutants phenotypically to determine how stress-induced SUMOylation may help maize survive adverse environments. Collectively, this project will generate much-needed tools and germplasm that can be exploited to understand how SUMO might reorganize maize chromatin and its transcriptome during stress, and identify key points in plant stress responses involving SUMOylation that can be manipulated for improved yield.The current understanding of SUMOylation in plants is still rudimentary and almost nonexistent in crop species where its manipulation may have substantial agricultural impact. This project will provide interdisciplinary training of the next generation of plant scientists working on crops. This research will collectively incorporate postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates as well as high school students sponsored by the Wisconsin Youth Apprenticeship Program (YAP) in Biotechnology.  During the course of this project, reagents, techniques, mutants, and transgenic lines will be generated that will provide a much needed foundation to investigate SUMOylation in maize, and hopefully offer new strategies to rationally alter the SUMO system for agricultural and medicinal benefit.  Plant resources will be available through the Maize Genetics Cooperative Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu).

1068,"With a rapidly growing population and decreasing farmland, the world will need to dramatically increase crop yields. The cells in the edible parts of corn, beans, rice, wheat, and peas undergo a specialized process called endoreduplication where the cells replicate their DNA many times. Although individual cells undergo different amounts of endoreduplication, the proportion of cells remains constant from plant to plant. When geneticists try to increase endoreduplication, they find that the response of seemingly identical cells is somewhat random: some cells respond strongly, some moderately, and some not at all. This observation raises one of the biggest questions in developmental biology: how do identical cells make different decisions? The proposed research will investigate the counterintuitive hypothesis that individual plant cells make these decisions about how much to endoreduplicate utilizing small, random molecular differences. This hypothesis is surprising: biologists would normally expect randomness to be suppressed, since development is highly reproducible, always creating the same proportion of endoreduplicated cells. Instead, randomness may in fact be required to produce this regular portion of endoreduplicated cells. Testing this hypothesis will require advanced use of computers to examine individual cells over time. University students and middle school girls will simultaneously be involved in this analysis as well as being trained in computational skills.Endoreduplicating cells of crop plants are buried deep within the seed coat where they are experimentally inaccessible. Endoreduplication will thus be studied in Arabidopsis thaliana sepals, whose epidermal cells are accessible for live imaging as they endoreduplicate. The transcription factor Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1 (ATML1) drives sepal endoreduplication, and may cause it to occur randomly. Since ATML1 is expressed in all epidermal cells, it is unclear how ATML1 causes only a few cells to endoreduplicate. Preliminary data show that ATML1 triggers endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner: high ATML1 makes all epidermal cells endoreduplicate, low ATML1 prevents any endoreduplication, and individual sepal cells have varying levels of ATML1. The hypothesis tested here is that randomly fluctuating ATML1 causes different levels of endoreduplication in different cells; a few cells exceed ATML1's threshold, triggering endoreduplication, while other cells remain below the threshold and do not endoreduplicate. In Aim 1, we will determine whether ATML1 fluctuations initiate endoreduplication. The associated education goal will be to work with undergraduate students to analyze images generated in this aim. For Aim 2, we will determine whether ATML1 feedback loops drive endoreduplication by amplifying differences in ATML1 expression and, in an associated educational aim, students will write and publish a computational modeling glossary to better understand the newly generated models. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the molecular mechanism through which ATML1 induces endoreduplication in a dosage-dependent manner. We will also develop an outreach to middle school students for the analysis of images from Aim 3 in a hands-on, web-based image analysis workshop.

The master teachers will participate in coursework that highlights mathematics content and pedagogical techniques and complementary Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID) Path Trainings on classroom strategies that utilize writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and reading (WICOR) and culturally relevant teaching.  The master teachers will have a variety of opportunities to take leadership roles such as performing mathematics demonstrations, co-teaching courses, and acting as district advocates in their high-needs schools.  The project involves collaboration between the Rice University School Mathematics Project, Tapia Center for Excellence and Equity, and Glasscock School of Continuing Studies, AVID, and educators from the Houston Independent School District.This Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship project will utilize Avid Path Trainings and complementary, content-rich graduate courses to develop master teachers ability to prepare college-ready, STEM students.  The focus on WICOR and culturally relevant teaching are in response to an emerging body of research that recommends that training for instructional leaders integrate high-quality instructional methods in an equitable learning environment.  A novel aspect of the project is the introduction to adult education skills that master teachers will receive, which they will then apply as they mentor other teachers.  This work is grounded in the theory of andragogy, which has six principles that address adult learners' (1) need to know, (2) self-concept, (3) prior experiences, (4) readiness to learn, (5) orientation to learning, and (6) motivation to learn.  Project evaluation will include assessment of the master teachers' effectiveness through Teaching for Robust Understanding of Mathematics classroom observation protocols, leadership through a modified version of the Survey for AVID Teachers, and adult education skills through the Andragogical Practices Inventory.  The Diverse Disposition Index will be use to assess their understanding of diversity and equity issues.

1070,"Advances in next-generation sequencing have opened up additional avenues of investigation due to the reduction in costs and the bioinformatic tools and functional resources available.  That said, there is still a critical need for advancing sequence visualization tools to aid in sequence analysis.  This EAGER project will develop a new type of genome representation - a Variant Graph which provides an innovative way to visualize and identify variants in genome sequences across related populations within a species. If successfully implemented, a Variant Graph will provide a novel means to leverage next generation sequencing data to create more accurate gene models. In addition, a fully Variant Graph based MAKER-P genome annotation pipeline will provide a leap forwards in genome-annotation and project management by providing a means for simultaneously annotating and managing genome sequences generated from multiple plant cultivars through Gramene (www.gramene.org) and CyVerse (formerly the iPlant Collaborative; www.cyverse.org).  The goals of this project are to take advantage of the wealth of sequence assemblies available for plants to (1) create and deploy a Variant Graph for crop plants using genome sequences available for maize and rice through the Gramene database; (2) leverage MAKER-P to create the first genome-annotation pipeline capable of exploiting the full potential of the Variant Graph to improve the annotations of the maize and rice reference assemblies; and, (3) deploy a cutting-edge Variant Graph based variant-calling pipeline within Gramene.

1071,"The PI will build a research program to develop novel integrated circuits and antennas that can generate high-power pulses with frequencies up to one terahertz (THz), several hundred times higher than the frequency of today's cellular networks. By exploiting the advantages of THz radiation, the proposed research program can transform wireless communications, imaging, and spectroscopic systems. THz communications systems will offer greater bandwidth and will also track mobile receivers with better fault tolerance than competing technologies with similar range and bandwidth, such as free space optical communication. THz imaging systems can not only bolster homeland's security by accurate detection of hidden objects and explosives, but also can prevent tens of thousands of lives lost in car accidents every year by increasing the accuracy of collision avoidance automotive radars. THz spectroscopy systems can identify the species of gas molecules with high specificity and detect trace quantities of those molecules with high sensitivity.  The PI's long-term educational goal is to inspire students at all levels to pursue careers in STEM disciplines. Working with the Rice University Office of STEM Engagement to provide research experience and internship opportunities for high-school teachers from Houston Independent School District, the PI will assist teachers with the development of their physics curriculum. The PI will work with the Rice Center for Excellence & Equity to engage underrepresented minority students in research and to provide summer internship opportunities for them. The objective of the proposed research program is to develop novel integrated circuits and antennas that can generate, radiate, detect, and steer coherent high-power pulses with frequencies up to 1THz.  With today's silicon processes, it is possible to build a complex integrated circuit with on-chip antennas operating in frequencies up to 500GHz. However, most of the existing solutions are narrow-band and based on continuous-wave signal generation.  To push the performance limits of high-speed wireless communications, three-dimensional radar imaging, and THz spectroscopy, broadband sources and detectors are required.

1072,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARYThis CAREER award supports theoretical research and education to advance understanding Quantum materials which hold great promise for technology. These are compounds in which quantum physics plays an essential role in enabling exceptional electronic or magnetic properties.  Quantum materials may enable new electronic devices, perhaps based on high temperature superconductivity or topologically robust quantum circuits. Superconductors can carry electric current without dissipation while topological states are new states of electronic matter that may enable quantum computation. An obstacle to realizing this potential has been the complexity often exhibited by these systems. This CAREER award supports the investigation of a new theoretical paradigm to tackle this issue, inspired by so-called many-body localization. In quantum physics, particles can behave like waves. Many-body localization is the idea that the interference between quantum waves can  freeze  the dynamics of interacting electrons, producing different classes of quantum states with different properties. In this project, ideas from the theory of localization will be applied to systems of many interacting electrons, with the view that the statistical classification of different types of excited many-body states may prove essential for determining properties in complex materials. This is very different from the usual approaches that stress the properties of the ground state at the absolute zero of temperature. In particular, if successful, the statistical approach developed here will provide new theoretical tools to characterize the complex behavior that arises from the melting of competing electronic phases. Understanding the latter may be a key to unlocking the potential of quantum materials for technological applications.  The PI will also investigate the role of strong electron-electron interactions on the transport of electric charge and heat in quantum materials. An educational component of the project aims to make modern mathematical tools more accessible to undergraduate physics majors by emphasizing algorithms and visualization. In the U.S., physics majors are currently taught mathematics developed prior to the 20th century, yet research now employs many more modern mathematical tools. These can be presented to undergraduates using an algorithmic, problem-solving, approach. The PI will create learning modules that will be tested in the classroom and openly disseminated via a permanent Rice-hosted web repository. TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis CAREER award supports theoretical research and education to advance understanding Quantum materials. The rich variety of collective phenomena exhibited by quantum materials holds great promise for technology. An obstacle to realizing this potential has been the complexity often exhibited by these systems. Due to the interplay of interactions, frustration, and material disorder, many compounds exhibit competing low temperature phases. These are often found in proximity to quantum critical regimes that may arise from fluctuations of the many different ordered states. It is now believed that quantum wave interference can induce the Anderson localization of a many-particle interacting system, in the presence of disorder or frustration. This many-body localization suggests a paradigm shift to the statistical classification of many-particle states, instead of a singular focus on the ground state. Transport measurements are the primary probe of quantum interference, but understanding transport in correlated materials remains a challenge. Project goals include: bringing statistical methods developed in one-body Anderson localization physics to bear on quantum many particle systems, and revealing correlation-dominated transport effects in non-Fermi liquids. The focus is on low-dimensional quantum critical regimes and driven topological systems. The goal of the educational component is to make available more modern mathematical tools to physics and STEM students and workers.Specific research and education objectives are to:1) Test the hypothesis that the many-body localization transition can be continuous, and investigate the physics of the  bad metal  phase predicted to occur above it.2) Test the hypothesis that  clustering  between the probability peaks of different many-body states determines the relaxation dynamics in the bad metal phase, and investigate competing orders in the presence of inhomogeneity and one-body state Chalker scaling.3) Investigate new transport effects that directly reveal the influence of correlations, by exploiting novel geometries for edge loop drag and quantum quench dynamics in 2D topological insulators, and by sharpening the roles of virtual and real collisions in the thermoelectric transport of correlated electron fluids.4) Develop and disseminate virtual learning modules for topics in modern mathematics accessible to undergraduate physics majors, emphasizing algorithms and visualization. The PI will create learning modules starting with Lie algebra representation theory, and these will be tested in the classroom and openly disseminated via a permanent Rice-hosted web repository.Ideas germinated from many-body localization may lead to insight into the interplay of competing orders, disorder, and frustration in correlated electron systems; however, many fundamental questions regarding the nature or even the existence of the many-body localization transition currently are unanswered, particularly in dimensions higher than one. The approaches will (a) introduce improved models amenable to exact numerical or analytical solutions, and (b) exploit the proximity of a 2D many-body localization transition to a special zero temperature Anderson-Mott transition. Competing orders and critical delocalization will be studied in an interacting version of an integrable quasicrystal model. The PI's investigation of thermoelectric transport will be in collaboration with experimentalists who are experts on graphene, and will help disentangle the roles of hydrodynamics, quasiparticle and transport lifetimes in marginal Fermi liquids.

1073,"To ensure the safety of the world's food supply given the threats of rapid population growth and declining arable land and water resources, innovative strategies for breeding the next generation of high-yield potential and climate-resilient crops will have to be implemented. New research strategies should create novel crop traits that have not yet been achieved in order to substantially enhance yield potential under marginal environments. How can this enormous goal be attained? It is now fully appreciated that any further improvements in genetic potential for yield, stress tolerance and water and nutrient use efficiency will have to rely on the ability to create complex genomic configurations that lead to novel biochemical and physiological traits. This project represents the use of contemporary research tools to solve an old puzzle. It represents a closer look and more strategic examination of one of the most enigmatic and relatively unexploited concepts in plant genetics, the phenomenon of transgressive variation. Transgressive variation is observed when progeny derived from two divergent parents are superior (or inferior) to both parents. Using rice to test the concept, this project will determine which DNA segments or RNA molecules cause transgressive traits for salinity and low temperature stress tolerance.This project will test the hypothesis that transgressive stress tolerance phenotypes in biparental cross combinations of rice are the consequences of ideal shuffling and complementation effects between two divergent parental genomes leading to genetic network rewiring. New paradigms built upon the power of regulon restructuring, regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and DNA methylation will be explored to understand the intricate mechanisms by which novel gene expression patterns mediate transgression from parental phenotypes. By integrated use of various next-generation DNA sequencing applications such as genome-Seq, mRNA-Seq, ncRNA-Seq, and bisulfite-Seq, this project will: 1) discover stress-regulated miRNAs/siRNAs that are transgressively expressed in intraspecific recombinants with novel salt tolerance phenotypes, and those that are transgressively expressed in interspecific recombinants with novel low temperature or other stress tolerance attributes; 2) establish meaningful correlations between mRNA and miRNA/siRNA transcriptome signatures among recombinants and their respective parents to evelop hypotheses on how global gene expression is altered in transgressive segregants; and 3) establish meaningful correlations between transcriptome signatures and genome methylation profiles between recombinants and their parents to develop hypotheses on how epigenomic changes alter gene regulation in transgressive segregants. The approach will address the possibilities that: a) stress tolerance phenotypic transgression is due to regulatory genes that acquired optimal function because of compatible regulatory clusters in their new genetic background, i.e., regulon restructuring; b) network reconfiguration in recombinants is due to coupling or uncoupling of trans-acting ncRNAs and their target regulatory genes or genomic loci from either parents; and c) genome shuffling alters the methylation profiles in recombinants leading to novel gene expression signatures. Outcomes will advance our understanding of the intricacies of genetic and epigenetic networks towards applications to stress tolerance breeding in rice and other major cereal crops. The genomics datasets to be generated will be made available to the broader scientific community through public data repositories including the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI and DDBJ. The rice genetic stocks to be characterized will be made available to other researchers through the USDA rice genetic stock maintenance and distribution center.

1074,"Poverty, saving species, repowering the world with renewable energy, lifting people up to live better lives - there are no easy answers to guiding our planet on the path toward sustainability. Complex problems require sophisticated solutions. They involve intricacy beyond human capabilities, the kind of big-data processing and analysis that only advanced large-scale computing can provide. This NSF Expedition in Computing launches CompSustNet (http://www.compsust.net), a vast research network powered by the nation's recognized university computer science programs, charged with applying the emerging field of computational sustainability to solving the world's seemingly unsolvable resource problems. Put simply, the project will enlist some of the top talents in computing, social science, conservation, physics, materials science, and engineering to unlock sustainable solutions that safeguard our planet's future.Computational Sustainability is, at its core, the belief that with sufficiently advanced computational techniques, we can devise sustainable solutions that meet the environmental, societal, and economic needs of today while providing for future generations. In much the same way IBM's supercomputer Watson could defeat any challenger in Jeopardy!, computational sustainability posits that a computer-engineered solution can be applied to world's difficult and challenging problems - from helping farmers and herders in Africa survive severe droughts to developing a smart power grid fueled entirely by renewable energy. CompSustNet is a large national and international multi-institutional research network led by Cornell University and including 11 other US academic institutions: Bowdoin, Caltech, CMU, Georgia Tech, Howard University, Oregon State, Princeton, Stanford, UMass, University of South California, and Vanderbilt University, as well as collaborations with several international universities. But CompSustNet is not just an academic enterprise, as it also includes key governmental and non-governmental organizations that specialize in conservation, poverty mitigation, and renewable energy, such as The Nature Conservancy, The World Wildlife Fund, The International Livestock Research Institute, The Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.CompSustNet's core mission is to significantly expand the horizons of computational sustainability and foster the advancement of state-of-the-art computer science to achieve the scale to tackle global problems. Research will focus on cross-cutting computational topics such as optimization, dynamical models, simulation, big data, machine learning, and citizen science, applied to sustainability challenges.  For example, computational sustainability is being put to work to resolve the problem of providing wetlands for shorebirds that migrate from the Arctic through California during a time of drought. As California gets drier, the shorebirds have nowhere to stop, rest, and refuel by eating wetland invertebrates. Scientists are developing new dynamic precision conservation techniques that use complex, big-data models to tackle the problem with NASA satellite imagery, meteorological forecasts, and citizen science in the form of thousands of bird location sightings from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's eBird checklisting app for birdwatchers. Through partnership with The Nature Conservancy, the program forecasts when and where wetland habitat would be needed for shorebirds, and the Conservancy pays Central Valley rice farmers to flood their fields at opportune times - providing benefits for birds and farmers at a time when extreme drought is making life tough for both. In similar ways, computational sustainability projects will also be hard at work innovating automated monitoring networks to protect endangered elephant population from poachers, promoting the discovery of novel ways to harvest energy from sun light, and designing algorithms to manage the generation and storage of renewable energy in the power grid.

1078,"The cells of the developing human embryo all carry the same genetic material, but they specialize into more than 200 different cell types that perform specific functions. These different cell types develop in precise spatial patterns that form the body plan of the embryo. Decades of genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that cells communicate using secreted signaling molecules, and that the signaling pathways activated inside the cell by these molecules are essential for conveying positional information to each cell, so that it specializes correctly. While many of the components of these pathways have been discovered, how the processes of signal interpretation and specialization occur has remained obscure due to the difficulty of observing and perturbing embryonic development. This challenge is particularly acute for mammalian embryos that develop in utero. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) represent a potential solution to these challenges, as they are capable of following developmental programs in a culture dish, enabling elucidation of human development to a degree that is otherwise impossible.  This project combines experimental studies of hESCs grown in particular spatial patterns and mathematical modeling to dissect how cells interpret signals and differentiate in spatial patterns during the earliest stages of development. Coupled with this research program is a spectrum of educational activities aimed at training the next generation of scientists to perform interdisciplinary, quantitative research in the biological sciences. Planned activities include outreach to K-12 students, education aimed at high school advanced placement teachers, and innovative undergraduate and graduate courses. Following successful introduction at Rice University, these courses will be widely distributed through the Coursera online platform.Mechanistic studies of pattern formation during mammalian development are challenging due the difficulty of observing and manipulating the embryo in utero. This project takes advantage of a recently developed in vitro system in which patterns form in hESC colonies grown in controlled geometries using micropatterning technology. The patterns form from the combination of an inductive signal added to the culture medium (BMP4) as well as paracrine signals between cells that have been identified as Wnt and Activin-Nodal signals. The project will use this system to quantitatively deconstruct the mechanisms of early patterning in the mammalian embryo. First, similar micropatterning technology will be used to isolate extremely small colonies of hESCs (1-10 cells). Colonies with a single cell will be used to directly measure the response to the inductive signal without interference from neighboring cells. Colonies with two cells will be used to understand the response to the paracrine signals in a simplified system, while those with larger number of cells will be used to measure how cells integrate signals from multiple neighbors. Results from these small colonies will be used to create mathematical models capable of predicting patterning in larger colonies of thousands of cells that display the full spectrum of embryonic fates. These models will be validated and further developed by experiments using live-cell imaging reporters for the activity of the BMP, Wnt, and Nodal signaling pathways together with reporters for cell fates. These dynamic observations are only possible in the in vitro development system, and will be used to correlate the dynamics of signaling in each individual cell with the fate it ultimately adopts. Taken together, these results will provide unprecedented understanding of early mammalian development and reveal principles of paracrine signaling and in vitro tissue self-organization.

1079,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is that it offers the potential for a new process technology to produce silicon using a sustainable, natural resource as the starting material. Currently, all silicon used in solar cells and computer chips, and all silicon used in the manufacture of silicon containing chemicals including silicone rubbers, oils, lubricants and fumed silica (paints, paper) etc. is produced in an energy, equipment and CO2-intensive process. Biogenic silica includes diatomaceous earth and many kinds of agricultural waste including rice hull ash, inorganic waste from bioethanol production, corn stover, and wheat chaff. The objectives of this project are to develop economical routes from these silica sources to high purity, high value silica products at significantly lower cost than currently available by using a green and sustainable technology. Key markets include electronic, optical, and photonic applications, specialty chemicals, and consumer products. The technical objectives of this Phase I project are to successfully depolymerize biogenic silicas at temperatures ?? 200??C to produce distillable alkoxysilanes. The primary silica source is rice hull ash (RHA), a sustainable, heavy metal free, silica rich agricultural waste. This process uses catalytic base to dissolved RHA silica in antifreeze at ?? 200??C followed by exchange with alcohol to produce alkoxysilanes. In contrast, traditional alkoxysilanes are made from silicon metal produced by carbothermal reduction of silica with carbon at 1900 ??C in an electric arc furnace; a high energy, capital equipment and CO2 intensive process. A further advantage to this process is that the silica depleted RHA offers direct access to high purity (99.9999 %) photovoltaic grade silicon at multi-kg/day scales. If successful, the proposed project could change how high purity alkoxysilanes, precipitated silica, and fumed silica are produced as multiple RHA sources are available worldwide. The alkoxysilane products can be distilled to very high purity at very low cost compared to the same product made from Silicon metal. The initial goal is to produce tetraethoxysilane to compete against Silicon metal derived product and move thereafter to high purity precipitated silica for electronic and optical products applications.

1082,"This award provides support for the 2015 Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium that will take place at the University of Texas at Dallas during the Fall 2015 semester. The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University,  the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Texas at Dallas. It is intended for the participation of around 60 people, including 25 non-local graduate students. The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have an opportunity to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium consists of 7-8 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions, including a poster session, for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The Symposium is a forum for regional specialists in mathematical physics and related areas of analysis to become familiar with the latest problems and present their own results; in addition it introduces young mathematicians to the current state of the subject. This year's Symposium will focus on the areas where probability theory, dynamical systems theory, spectral theory, and partial differential equations intersect and interact. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration information, and an archive of the past symposium can be found at the website of the meeting: https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/tc/TeXAMP/TeXAMP-2015/TeXAMP-2015.html abstracting; Archives; Area; Area Analyses; austin; Award; Differential Equation; Doctor of Philosophy; dynamic system; Educational workshop; experience; falls; Feedback; graduate student; lectures; mathematical analysis; Mathematics; meetings; member; Physics; posters; Probability Theory; Research Personnel; Rice; senior faculty; Specialist; student participation; symposium; Systems Theory; Texas; theories; Underrepresented Groups; Universities; web site; WorkTEXAS ANALYSIS AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS SYMPOSIUM",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
1083,"The objective of this research was defined in the Phase I grant proposal as follows: “This proposed EPA-P3 Phase I project addresses a growing challenge of utilizing large quantities of agricultural biomass residues (waste) as a renewable, carbon-negative energy source in California.”  In the problem definition and justification for the proposed research of our the Phase I proposal we identified the primary reason for the decline in the use of the large quantities of available biomass residues (waste) for energy generation in California, as the lack of economic viability of large scale biomass power plants in the state due to inability to compete with natural gas in power generation. The transportation and handling cost of biomass residues makes them uneconomical for use as fuel in large power plants.  Our proposed solution to this problem was the following: “A potential solution is a new approach in the use of agricultural biomass residues (waste) for energy generation is gasification (pyrolysis) of the biomass combined with biochar production directly on-the-farm. This approach offers a carbon negative source of energy through carbon sequestration in the soil with added benefits of increased agricultural production.”  The objective of the proposed research in Phase II will continue as the sustainable and environmentally beneficial conversion of biomass residues (waste) into biochar. However, the emphasis will be on maximizing carbon sequestration in the soil for improving water retention and agricultural productivity. Energy generation in the form of usable heating or cooling will be a secondary objective.  We will be focusing our efforts toward working with the local agricultural industry and certain fire-hazard threatened communities in Northern California to convert the large amounts agricultural and forest biomass residues into biochar on-the-farm and onsite in the forest.

Objective 2: Develop antifungal candidate genes and gene constructs that can be used in targeted expression system to develop Fusarium-resistant barley. Objective 3: Identify components of the GA response that can be used as predictors of malting.  Approach: Produce gene macroarrays from our lemma-specific gene library and a new  epicarpspecific library. Probe libraries with cDNA from Fusarium-infected lemma and epicarp. Clone and identify the upregulated genes, and confirm tissue-specificity with RNA blots. A modified inverse PCR will be used to clone their promoters from barley. Promoter (upstream) regions will be ligated upstream of the green fluorescent protein gene in an expression vector and functionally confirmed in transient bombardment assays where tissues will be examined for fluorescence before and after infection with Fusarium. If successful, barley will be stably transformed with antifungal protein genes driven by these promoters using the Agrobacterium vector pRSHyg. These genes (cloned in this lab) include lemma thionin, Ltp, and germin. Transformants will be tested for Fusarium resistance. The gene for the barley gibberellin (GA) hormone receptor will be cloned using homologies to the rice receptor. The gene will be compared in GA response mutants. Receptor sequence and mRNA levels will be analyzed in barleys of varying malting qualities. The Barley1 GeneChip will be used to examine transcripts in 7 malting barleys and GA response mutants. The differences in transcript profiles will provide insights into the relationship of the GA signal transduction pathway and malting quality.

1086,"Objective(s): Mathematical models that predict behavior of pathogens in food can be used to verify critical control points in Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) programs. For example, they can be used to assess whether or not a process deviation results in a one log cycle increase of Clostridium perfringens during cooling of a cooked meat product during commercial processing. Models that predict behavior of pathogens can be integrated with data for pathogen contamination to predict dynamic changes in pathogen prevalence and number in food across unit operations of a production chain. Predictions of consumer exposure can then be used in a dose-response model to form a process risk model that predicts consumer exposure and response to pathogens in food produced by specific scenarios. Process risk models have great potential to improve food safety and public health by providing a better assessment of food safety and identification of risk factors. In the past, we have developed predictive models and process risk models that have proven highly useful in providing regulatory agencies and the food industry with an objective means of assessing food safety and identifying risk factors. The goal of the proposed research is to elevate that successful effort to the next level of sophistication by considering additional variables and developing new and improved models and more effectively transferring this new research to the food industry by providing updated and improved versions of our software products: the Predictive Microbiology Information Portal, ComBase, and the Pathogen Modeling Program.  1: Develop and validate predictive models for behavior of stressed and unstressed pathogens in food with added antimicrobials. This includes development of validated dynamic models for spores and vegetative foodborne pathogens for evaluating heating and cooling process deviations.   2: Develop and validate process risk models for higher risk pathogen and food combinatio  Approach: Effects and interactions of time, temperature, pH, acidulant, water activity, humectant, or preservatives (phosphates, organic acid salts, and nitrite) in meat and poultry products, as well as in rice, beans, and pasta will be assessed to collect kinetic data for pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus).  Kinetic data will be modeled using primary and secondary models.  Predictive models performance will be evaluated using the acceptable prediction zone method.  Once validated and published, predictive models will be incorporated into the Pathogen Modeling Program and data will be archived in ComBase.  Kinetic data for development of predictive microbiology models for survival and growth of pathogens (Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, and Listeria monocytogenes) on higher risk food (tomatoes, lettuce, raw milk, and crab meat) will be obtained in inoculated pack studies.  Pathogens will be enumerated on higher risk food during storage trials using an automated miniature most probable number method.  Kinetic data will be modeled using neural network modeling methods and models will be validated against independent data using the acceptable prediction zone method.  Whole sample enrichment real time polymerase chain reaction (WSE-qPCR) will be used to obtain data for prevalence, number, and types of pathogens on higher risk food.  Predictive microbiology models and contamination data obtained by WSE-qPCR will be integrated to form process risk models that predict consumer exposure and response to pathogens on higher risk food produced by different scenarios.  All new models will be added to both versions of the Pathogen Modeling Program.  A link to ARS, Poultry Food Assess Risk Models website will be provided in the portal.  Combase will be made compatible with the PMP. antimicrobial; Archives; Bacillus cereus; bean; Behavior; Campylobacter jejuni; Clostridium perfringens; Computer software; cooking; Crabs; Data; data acquisition; Databases; Development; Domestic Fowls; Dose; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli O157:H7; Food; Food Industry; Food Safety; foodborne pathogen; Goals; Growth; hazard; Heating; high risk; improved; inorganic phosphate; International; Kinetics; Lettuce - dietary; Link; Listeria monocytogenes; mathematical model; Meat; Meat Products; Methods; microbial; Microbiology; Milk; Modeling; Neural Network Simulation; Nitrites; operation; organic acid; pathogen; Performance; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Poultry Products; predictive modeling; Prevalence; Process; Production; programs; Public Health; Publishing; Reproduction spores; Research; response; Rice; Risk; Risk Factors; Salmonella; Salts; Sampling; Staphylococcus aureus; Stress; Temperature; Time; Tomatoes; Update; Water; web siteDATA ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT OF PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR FOOD SAFETY AND THEIR ASSOCIATED USE IN INTERNATIONAL PATHOGEN MODELING AND MICROBIAL DATABASES",1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06

Experimentally determine for soybeans, rice and wheat and some economically important weeds how much the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased crop yields and weed growth since 1960.  (NP 216 Action Plan Component 5)  Approach: Research will focus on determining how rising temperature alters responses of crop and weed physiology, growth, and product quality to elevated carbon dioxide. Differences among genotypes within several crop species in responses to elevated carbon dioxide and temperature will be assessed to identify traits which would help to adapt crops to these global change conditions. Responses of weeds in a locally and nationally important crop system will be evaluated to determine if rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature will increase their impact on crop yields and their resistance to control by glyphosate, a popular herbicide.

1088,"Objective(s): Objective 1: Characterize effects of flood and soil management on As (inorganic and total) and Cd accumulation in rice grain.  1A: Does alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation management reliably lower inorganic As (iAs) in rice grain without causing excessive grain Cd in rice genotypes?  1B: Develop extraction and analysis methods to rapidly measure the inorganic As (iAs) in rice grain samples.  Objective 2: Characterize competition of other cations with Cd accumulation by rice and vegetables.  2A: Clarify whether increased Zn2+ activity reduces Cd2+ accumulation by spinach, lettuce and rice and whether plant Zn deficiency causes up-regulation of Zn transporters which increases uptake of Zn and Cd compared to Zn-sufficient crops. 2B: Clarify whether increased manganese (Mn2+) is more important than Zn2+ in inhibiting uptake of Cd2+ by rice and vegetables from nutrient solutions with environmentally relevant activity of Cd2+.  Objective 3: Characterize effects of soil amendments on Pb, Cd and As accumulation by garden crops to improve advice to urban gardeners regarding risk reduction for contaminated urban soils.  3A: Characterize the effects of soil amendments and mulch on Pb and Cd accumulation by garden crops from contaminated urban garden soils. 3B: Characterize the effects of soil amendments on Pb and Cd accumulation by crops grown in contaminated urban gardens.  Objective 4: Continue evaluation of the effects of crop species and crop Zn on bioavailability of crop Cd to animals.  Test whether crop Zn concentration and crop species affect the bioavailability of crop Cd to monogastric animals in order to clarify if crop species and crop Zn should be included in technically valid limits for Cd in crops.  Approach: Because rice accumulates higher levels of inorganic As (iAs) than other crops, regulations are being imposed on iAs in rice grain which are lower than achieved by some growers. More aerobic soil management both lowers grain iAs and increases grain Cd. In order to identify methods to produce rice with lower levels of iAs, samples of rice grain from cooperators’ field tests of the effect of irrigation management, genetic variation, and soil amendment application will be analyzed for iAs and Cd (which may be increased by aerobic soil management to lower grain iAs). Previous methods for analysis of iAs in rice were so expensive that few samples could be evaluated to identify the needed genetic variation and irrigation management variation needed to lower grain iAs. An improved method for simple analysis of iAs using hydride generation from only iAs in samples was developed and will be validated by an international inter-laboratory project. Simpler and faster methods to extract iAs and Cd from rice flour will be evaluated so that market demanded analyses might be made available to the industry. Chelator-buffered nutrient solution methods will be developed to test the competition among elements for absorption of Cd by rice and spinach using levels of Cd, Mn and Zn chemical activity in the solution similar to soil solution. Recent studies indicated that Cd is absorbed on a Mn transporter in rice, but a Zn transporter in other species. Flooded soil production increases dissolved Mn but reduces dissolved Zn in rice soils until fields are drained; after drainage, much higher Cd absorption can occur. Cooperators field tests of irrigation management which limits both As and Cd in grain will be investigated. In other soils, crop Cd accumulation may exceed allowable limits in spinach and lettuce. High natural soil Cd and low Zn in spinach production fields in California allows excessive Cd accumulation in spinach and lettuce. Characterizing the direct competition among these trace elements in representative crop species will clarify needed management changes to limit Cd accumulation by both crop groups. Besides testing direct inhibition of Cd uptake by Zn and Mn in both species, the effect of Mn and Zn deficiency on up-regulation of the uptake rate of Cd will be evaluated. The potential utility of soil amendments on uptake of Pb, Cd and As by garden crops, and bioaccessibility of soil Pb to mammals will be evaluated both in the greenhouse, and when improved methods have been identified, will be tested in cooperating urban gardens with high soil Pb, Cd or As. Because food Cd limits presently do not consider variation in Cd bioavailability among crops, or the effect of crop Zn on Cd bioavailability, the effect of usual co-contaminating Zn on accumulation of diet Cd by weanling pigs will be tested with diets containing 20% Romaine lettuce or spinach. Bioavailability will be evaluated by analyzing duodenum, liver and kidney from test animals. These studies should provide evidence that the effect of Zn on Cd absorption, and effect of spinach oxalate on Cd absorption should be included in international regulation of Cd in crops. absorption; Aerobic; Affect; Amendment; Animal Testing; Animals; Biological Availability; Buffers; California; Cations; Cereals; Chelating Agents; Chemicals; Diet; Drainage procedure; Duodenum; Elements; Evaluation; Family suidae; field study; Floods; Flour; Food; Generations; Genotype; improved; Industry; International; Irrigation; Kidney; Laboratories; Lettuce - dietary; Liver; Mammals; Manganese; Marketing; Measures; Methods; Nutrient; Oxalates; Plants; Production; Regulation; Rice; Risk Reduction; Sampling; Soil; Spinach - dietary; Testing; Trace Elements; Up-Regulation; uptake; Variant; Vegetables; Zinc deficiencyENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE TRACE ELEMENT BIOAVAILABILITY IN FOOD CROPS",1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.9993292266123868
1089,"More than 100 years ago, a substance was isolated from rice bran (thiamine) that when ingested  cured  beriberi disease in populations consuming polished rice as a staple1. Subsequently, 12 more vitamins were discovered and their essential roles in human health were established2,3. Humans and animals cannot synthesize vitamins and are entirely dependent on dietary intake to meet daily requirements yet the edible portions of staple crops contain insufficient levels to achieve this goal2. For instance, the low levels of several B vitamins, vitamin E and provitamin A carotenoids in maize result in chronic deficiencies in populations consuming maize as a staple crop4-8 and require maize based feed for animals to be supplemented with these vitamins. In developed countries like the US, extreme vitamin deficiencies (e.g., resulting in beriberi) were mostly eliminated in the mid-20th century by industrial scale fortification of the food supply, but portions of the population (e.g., the elderly, poor, women of childbearing age and adolescents) still have chronic suboptimal micronutrient levels that, while less overt, carry long-term negative health consequences8-16. The situation for developing countries, which lack the infrastructure for large-scale fortification of food and feed supplies, is dire. More than 3 billion people suffer from extreme or chronic micronutrient deficiencies that negatively impact growth, mental and physical development, immune responses, ability to work and life expectancy, with women and children being disproportionately affected16-20. This proposal uses Arabidopsis as a model genomic and genetic organism to advance our fundamental understanding of the control of four B vitamins and vitamin E that are limiting in seed. This research will not only provide new fundamental knowledge about how these essential compounds are made, transported and accumulated in seed but also provide a road map for ongoing efforts to balance the levels of vitamins in crops to help alleviate nutrient micronutrient deficiencies on a global scale. A major route for this will be to interface this project with a parallel, planned project on B vitamins in maize seed.

1090,"Rice is the staple food for over half of the world&#39;s population. Milled rice is deficient in almost all important nutrients including protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and fibers except carbohydrates. The protein, vitamin E, and iron contents are remarkably low compared with other cereal crops. Additionally, milled rice has very little zinc and no vitamin A. Thus, rice generally lacks sufficient nutrients to sustain life, if used as the sole source of food. The poor nutrition, markedly the deficiency in iron and zinc, of milled rice has caused severe malnutrition problems, particularly among children and older populations, in developing countries where the access to other food is limited. Zinc (Zn) deficiency has been estimated to affect 95.4% of the population in South Asia and other areas where people largely consume rice as the staple food. Stunting due to zinc deficiency affects 40% of preschool children (Hotz and Brown 2004), and 82% of pregnant women (Bhutta and Haider 2009). Iron deficiency anaemia is a worldwide public health problem with global prevalence estimated at 24.8%. The highest prevalence is found in Africa, the Middle East, Central, South, and South-East Asia, and areas of Latin America, where two thirds of children under five, and almost 50% of women are anaemic (WHO2008). While nutrient fortification has been widely used for wheat and maize flour and are very successful in improving human diet nutrition worldwide, an effective method for rice fortification is not available thus far as rice is consumed as whole grain. No good method can stably force nutrients such as minerals and vitamins to penetrate into the rice grain and sustain the washing steps before cooking, a traditional practice used by almost all families.In this project, we will develop new methods to allow minerals and vitamins penetrate into rice grains.

1091,"Over 80 million acres of field corn (Zea mays) and 600,000 acres of sweet corn, worth about $65 billion and $1 billion respectively, are grown in the U.S. each year. The European corn borer (ECB) (Ostrinia nubilalis) and western corn rootworm (WCR) (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) account for over $1 billion each in control costs and grain losses annually. Rootworms are particularly problematic because of their propensity to evolve resistance to management tactics, including crop rotation (Gray et al. 2009), insecticides (Meinke et al. 1998), and now Bt toxins (Gassmann et al. 2011, 2014).There are numerous other corn insect pests that cause significant economic loss to U.S. corn producers. The southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella) causes several million dollars in damage to corn in the Western High Plains (Morrison et al. 1977). Recently, the sugarcane borer (D. saccharalis) has emerged as an important corn pest in the south (Castro et al. 2004, Porter et al. 2005). Significant foliage and ear feeders include the two most important lepidopteran pests of corn in the southeast, corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) (Buntin et al. 2004). Losses attributed to corn earworm in sweet corn can be as high as 50% (Wiseman 1999). The western bean cutworm (Striacosta albicosta) has recently expanded its range to become an increasingly serious corn pest as far east as Pennsylvania and north into Canada (e.g. Michel et al. 2010). Among underground pests, the northern corn rootworm (NCR) (D. barberi) is a perennial pest in much of the Corn Belt, and the southern corn rootworm (D. undecimpunctata howardi) is occasionally important, especially in the southeast. Many secondary pests, such as wireworms (Elateridae) and white grubs (Scarabaeidae), can cause serious local problems, and may be resurging with the decrease in soil insecticides used to manage rootworms following wide adoption of transgenic Bt corn. Widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoid seed treatments to control these secondary soil pests may not be sustainable because of increasing environmental concerns (Mullin et al. 2005, Krupke et al. 2012).Established in 1953 to address ECB, earlier versions of NC-205 evolved to include a broader array of corn pests. First other stalk-boring Lepidoptera were included, and then other above-ground Lepidoptera. This was a natural progression for the committee, as 1) these pests increased in economic importance, and 2) a pest species does not exist in isolation, but as part of a pest complex and arthropod community. NCCC-46, the Multistate Research Coordinating Committee &#39;Development, Optimization and Delivery of Management Strategies for Corn Rootworms&#39;, originated in 1964 as WCR was spreading eastward from the Great Plains into the Central Corn Belt (Gray et al. 2009). NCR was already an economic pest in the Corn Belt, but it was becoming clear that WCR was an even bigger threat to corn production.During the 1990s, NC-205 and NCCC-46 began to co-locate and meet sequentially during the same week. This was in part because several members were on both committees, but more importantly to invite Industry for discussing the deployment, efficacy, non-target effects, and insect resistance management (IRM) implications of transgenic Bt corn, topics of broad interest to both committees. This sequential meeting model became even more valuable upon the introduction of Bt transgenic corn targeting corn rootworm in 2003, its rapid adoption (Rice 2004), the stacking of genes targeting both corn rootworm and corn Lepidoptera in the same plant, and the discovery of WCR field resistance to Cry3Bb1 toxin (Gassmann et al. 2011). Because of the increasing interaction of NC205 and NCCC46, merging of the committees was discussed during the 2014 annual committee meetings. It was felt that a formal merging of the committees would be of mutual benefit, both scientifically and logistically, and after additional discussion, each committee voted to merge. Therefore, this NC-205 renewal proposal reflects the decision to merge the committee membership and address the larger corn insect pest complex, with emphasis on above-ground Lepidoptera pests and below-ground Coleoptera pests.Since the commercial release of Bt transgenic corn against ECB in 1996 and against rootworms in 2004, a revolution in corn insect pest management has occurred. Seed companies continue to develop genetically-modified (GM) crops for pest protection. New GM corn hybrids have resistance to a broader range of lepidopteran pests, some have resistance to coleopteran pests, and most current GM hybrids have genes targeting both Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. This technology often eliminates the need to store and handle insecticides and it increases the efficiency of grower operations and pest control (Rice 2004, Sappington 2014). However, the development of resistance by WCR to some Bt toxins is threatening to reverse these gains. Keeping abreast of these changes with timely and relevant research over an area as large and diverse as the U.S. Corn Belt lends itself to a coordinated, committee approach.Bt corn acreage in the U.S. has increased from 8% in 1997 to 80% in 2014. At this level of adoption, the potential for resistance increases. Research conducted by this committee was used to develop models predicting the rates of resistance evolution and efficacy of refuge in preventing resistance. This led to the IRM approach that used a 20% independent refuge planting; however, as GM technology has evolved, so has IRM. Recently deployed GM corn hybrids use multiple genes that target ECB and WCR. The IRM plan for these hybrids requires a smaller refuge, and seed mixtures (Bt and non-BT) are now being deployed. The models supporting these IRM modifications were constructed using the best information available, but a number of assumptions had to be made. These assumptions must be tested and research conducted to move them from assumptions to quantified variables. Furthermore, information is needed on the economics of this evolving technology at the field, farm, and regional levels. Addressing these knowledge gaps forms the basis for several objectives of the project. The long-term goal of our research is to develop sustainable ways to manage the corn insect pest complex. This is a high regional priority, and in the context of demonstrating sustainable practices, it also is an important national priority.

1092,"Pine bark at various sizes is used as a main component of potting substrates in the US where over 75% of nursery crops are grown in containers. In recent years, increased use of pine bark as a biofuel has led to reduced supplies for nursery growers. Rising costs and concerns over future availability have increased growers&#39; interests in using alternative substrates such as whole tree-based materials. In general, whole tree-based materials have lower water holding and ion exchange capacities compared with pine bark at similar sizes, resulting in high leaching potential of agrichemicals. Container nurseries apply on average 80 to 120 inches of irrigation water in addition to the 70 to 90 inches of average annual rainfall in Louisiana. Irrigation is applied daily, thus many growers prefer using substrates with a low water holding capacity. Rice hull ash (RHA) is a byproduct of burning rice husk as fuel for boilers or electricity generation. It is readily available in regions where rice is grown. Previous research indicates that tilling RHA into soil increased yield of rice, tomato, and quality of tobacco. However, no information is available on its use as a substrate amendment in container production of nursery crops. If RHA is to be used to increase water retention, irrigation frequency has to be adjusted to grow healthy plants. However, few studies have investigated physical and chemical properties of substrate amendments other than peat moss, and no study has investigated the effects of RHA on nutrient and water retention of pine bark or whole tree-based substrates and the quality of ornamental plants. Research is needed to quantify water and fertilizer use efficiency when using RHA and alternative substrate materials in nursery production. Baseline data and case studies will be essential for obtaining additional funding that can be used to develop and test new technologies for improving production sustainability and reducing reliance on pine bark. Outreach activities based upon baseline information developed from research and demonstrations will help educate all stakeholders on the available alternatives to improve profitability and minimize environmental impacts.

Emerging infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that have increased in incidence, geographical or host range; have changed pathogenesis; have newly evolved; or have been discovered or newly recognized.

Because of this complexity, understanding patterns and processes at each level of organization is necessary for effective conservation and management of these important systems.Fish play a central role in aquatic ecosystems through important individual, population-, and community-level interactions (e.g., Thorp and Bergey 1981; Hanson and Leggett 1986; Werner and Hall 1988; Osenberg et al. 1988; Crowder and Rice 1997; Aday et al. 2005), yet a variety of factors at each scale remain poorly understood. At the individual level, for example, it is unclear for many species how genetic and environmental factors (e.g., those linked to land and water use practices that influence water quality)interact to influence life-history strategies. Inter-population variation in demographics such as size- and age-structure are common (e.g., Danylchuk and Fox 1994; Jansen 1996; Bertschy and Fox 1999; Aday et al. 2003; Aday 2008), yet mechanisms associated with this variation are often unclear. Further, the ways that individual behaviors influence population dynamics, and the consequences of population-level interactions on community and ecosystem structure, are also poorly understood for many species and systems. From a practical standpoint, fisherymanagement initiatives often focus on individual species, ignoring underlying interactions that can have significant influence on the biology and ecology of the target species and system.Fish also provide a major source of protein for much of the world&#39;s population, yet recent investigations have indicated that harvest practices (both commercial and recreational) continue to imperil a number of important species (e.g., Myers and Worm 2003; Coleman et al. 2004); influences on many other species remain unexamined. In addition, contamination of aquatic systems has led to considerable concern about fish health and fish consumption. In the case of contaminants, though extremely numerous and widespread, recent attention has been focused on endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and their effects on fish, wildlife and people. Endocrine disrupting compounds, natural and synthetic chemicals that interfere with hormone-controlled physiological processes, include pesticides, pharmaceuticals, insecticides, and certain heavy metals (Helfman et al. 2009). Ongoing research suggests that these compounds can have significant influence on the health of fish, wildlife, and humans (e.g., Wiener and Spry 1996; Drevnick et al. 2006). As such, my research program over the next five years will focus not only on the effects of angling practices on commonly caught and consumed fish species, but also on assessing contaminant dynamics in aquatic systems, identifying mechanisms associated with their chemical transformation, transport, and bioaccumulation, and quantifying impacts on individuals, populations, and communities. Specific links to watershed and land and water use practices (e.g., production agriculture and CAFOs) will be an emphasis of the work. In sum, there are both theoretical and practical reasons for studying individual life histories, population dynamics, and community structure for both game and non-game fish species, and research implications extend from advancing scientific theory to enhancing public welfare. In particular, expected outcomes include a change in knowledge (new scientific publications associated with this research project; potential changes in policy as a result of the contaminant research), a change in action (including changes in fishery management practices;change in fish consumption patterns; change in land and water use practices), and a change in condition (safer food supply, cleaner and healthier environment).Aday, D.

1097,"Water and mineral nutrients are the major limiting factors for crop production, making irrigation and fertilizers a necessity for modern agriculture. With limited supplies of fresh water and energy resources, sustainability of agricultural practices directly depends on higher use efficiency of water and nutrients. Although extensive research effort has been directed toward understanding water use efficiency and drought tolerance, much less is known about the mechanisms of plant nutrient use efficiency and tolerance to low-nutrient status in the soil. Compared with N and P, the K+ nutrient is unique in that it functions in its ionic form and cannot be metabolized in plant cells. It is expected that mechanisms of K-use efficiency will be different from those controlling N and P nutrition. Our study will thus bridge a critical gap in our understanding of nutrient use efficiency. In this project, we will combine genomics, biochemistry and transformation, together with genetic analysis to identify genes controlling K-use efficiency in Arabidopsis and rice, a staple food crop and a cereal model. Further, these genes will be assembled into a functional network that illustrates how the gene products control the cellular processes related to low-K tolerance and K-use efficiency in rice. Results from this project will directly enhance our understanding of basic plant biology questions in membrane transport and mechanisms for environmental response and adaptation. This knowledge will also be applicable to other cereal crops in new practical approaches to modify plant growth under low-K conditions and improve crop yield with reduced use of fertilizers.

1098,"Plant diseases have a significant impact on agricultural productivity and, consequently affect the availability of food, feed and fiber for an ever-growing human population. In spite of considerable effort towards producing disease-resistant plants, the threat of plant diseases continues. Thus, more fundamental research is needed to understand the complex interactions between host plants and pathogens, specifically how pathogens target plants physiological processes and, how plants response is modulated in the presence of a threatening pathogen.Plant pathogenic bacteria represents a phylogenetic group that is adapted to a wide spectrum of environments and, are able to cause devastating diseases in a wide range of crops using diverse mechanisms. Those mechanisms are linked to a plethora of virulence factors that are constantly evolving, act redundantly, at different stages of the pathogen&#39;s life cycle and sometimes with remarkable host specificity. On the other hand, plant innate immune system is complex and also co-evolving with the challenging bacteria. Therefore, delineating how plant pathogenic bacteria interact and cause disease in host plants is challenging. Research with model plants and pathogens have laid out a strong foundation to understand the molecular and cellular events underlying plant-pathogen interactions. Significant progress in this area has also been achieved in some crop plants (Schwessinger et al, 2015). In rice, investigations into plant-pathogen interactions have been mainly focused on fungal pathogens and the bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Liu et al, 2014). However, not much is known about other rice bacterial pathogens of economic importance such as Burkholderia glumae and Burkholderia gladioli, the causal agents of bacterial panicle blight (BPB).BPB is an important emerging disease that causes severe yield losses in rice production in the United States and in countries where rice is cultivated. The pathogen is seed-borne and thrives at temperatures as high as 40oC. High temperatures combined high humidity in rice fields are conducive to the development of the disease. The disease is characterized by discoloration of the kernels with the panicle branches staying green. The bacteria causes abortion of the seeds and prevents grains from being filled. As a result, the panicles remain upright and, this latter symptom is easily observed in the field (Wamishe et al, 2015). Only cultural practices such as early planting time, low rate of nitrogen fertilizer and intermittent flooding can diminish the effects of the disease (Wamishe et al, 2015). No chemical control is available and most of the commercial rice cultivars are susceptible to these pathogens.Tackling the disease requires understanding of the pathogen and the host. There is little information on the biology of B. glumae and B. gladioli and many questions need to be addressed such as: how can these bacteria transition from free-living organisms in the plant rhizosphere or as endophytes to pathogenic status? What mechanisms B. glumae and B. gladioli employ to adapt to the environmental conditions? And, what processes confer B. glumae and B. gladioli host and tissue-specificity? This work will answer some of those questions (Objective 1).In addition to understanding the pathogen, more research is needed to investigate how durable and complete resistance can be achieved. This work will compare gene expression among cultivars with differential responses to the pathogen (Objective 2), will identify novel genes involved in resistant responses and will provide mechanistic insight into resistant responses (Objective 3). The proposed project will generate substantial information to understand the disease and, hence will contribute to current efforts to generating cultivars with better capacity to withstand the detrimental effects of these pathogens. This research is important for the state of Arkansas, having the largest rice production in the United States. It also has far-reaching implications worldwide as the disease is spreading affecting developing countries were rice is a staple crop. abortion; Address; Affect; Agriculture; Area; Arkansas; Bacteria; Biology; Burkholderia; Cereals; Chemicals; Complex; Country; Developing Countries; Development; Disease; Disease Resistance; Economics; Environment; Event; feeding; Fertilizers; Fiber; Floods; Food; Foundations; fundamental research; Gene Expression; Genes; Hand; High temperature of physical object; Human; Humidity; Immune system; insight; Investigation; Life; Life Cycle Stages; Link; Molecular; Nitrogen; novel; Organism; Oryza; pathogen; pathogenic bacteria; Phylogenetic Analysis; Physiological Processes; Plant Diseases; Plant Model; Plants; Population; prevent; Process; Production; Productivity; Research; Resistance; response; Rice; Seeds; Specificity; Staging; Symptoms; Temperature; Time; Tissues; United States; Virulence Factors; Work; XanthomonasMOLECULAR APPROACHES TO UNDERSTAND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BACTERIAL PATHOGENS AND THEIR HOST PLANTS",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.9999772825781746,0.999999,0.999999
1099,"An in-depth knowledge of relationships between crop growth and development and environmental factors including projected changes in climate that includes extremes is a prerequisite to truly understanding crop production and to provide decision support system for stakeholders such as farm managers, governments, students, and planners to meet the food and fiber needs of the growing world population. An interdisciplinary, integrated approach involving state-of-the-art,controlled environment facilities for experimentation and algorithm development, and process-level crop models will be utilized to assist stakeholder needs in this area.Executive SummaryClimate change and variability, escalating costs of agricultural inputs, growing competition for land, water and energy, and feeding increasing population with greater purchasing power are challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century and beyond. As agricultural production and weather/climate are intimately connected, the future of agricultural production is critical to regional and national economies and to global food/fiber/energy security. In production agriculture, every season is unique, and when precipitation, temperature, and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation regimes combine with cultural practices, soils, and variety characteristics, crop production and policy managers have more variables to consider than the human mind can reasonably organize. Information needs to be organized within some sort of theoretical framework to assist resource and policy managers in decision making processes. With the availability of computers and a comprehensive knowledge of how crops respond to weather variables, decision support systems can be developed to assist in making production-management and policy decisions. Therefore, understanding crop responses to environment and management is pivotal in providing decision support for stakeholders such as farm managers, governments, and planners to meet the food and fiber needs of the growing world population.This project addresses our long-term goal of understanding the interactive effects of environmental factors on crops. Crops grown for food and fiber (cotton, corn, rice, and soybean) in the US Midsouth will be our main focus. Despite many experiments on the effects of environmental factors including the changes projected in climate on crops, there are still few studies that have addressed and quantified the effects of a range of environmental factors to develop meaningful functional relationships for various growth and developmental processes for plants grown under realistic field-like conditions.We will investigate the effects of temperature, drought, elevated atmospheric [CO2] and UV-B radiation, and other environmental variables on these crops to provide functional algorithms for improving existing crop models and/or developing new models. We will use an internationally unique system of sunlit chambers that allow the growth of tall crops under complete control of microclimate and atmosphere, with simultaneous precise monitoring of water and carbon balance throughout the life of the crop. The crop will be grown from sowing to specific growth stages under current and projected climatic conditions. Quantitative data on various growth and developmental processes will be measured, and functional algorithms will be developed for those processes. We intend to contribute our data to improve the performance of crop simulation models such as cotton and soybean (GOSSYM and GLYSIM) and corn (DSSAT or CEREES-Maize and soybean), and to assist in the integration of these crop models with regional climate models. The improved crop-climate assessment tools can be used to assist producers in day-to-day production decisions and policy makers in devising mitigation strategies to minimize the impact of climate change on food and fiber production in the coming decades.

1100,"The demand for agricultural crops is expected to more than double by 2050. This is due largely to an increase in world population, which is anticipated to grow from about 7 billion people today, to well over 9 billion in 2050, but also reflects increasing consumption of meat and dairy products, and the use of biomass in the production of biofuels. Meeting the goal of doubling crop production by 2050 is a major challenge. Indeed, between 1985 and 2005, crop yields per acre increased only about 20%. If this increase alone were to continue until 2050, we would fall well short of demand. Moreover, the increases in yields for the major crops that feed the world--maize, rice, wheat and soybeans--have stagnated in many regions including locations within the U.S. In addition, we are in a period of climate instability (climate change) with an uncertain future, and the potential of having major negative impacts on crop productivity. What is needed is a  Second Green Revolution  that includes what the Royal Society has referred to a  sustainable intensification of global agriculture.  This goal, which will necessitate higher yields with less input of water, will require the development of crops that are more resistant to abiotic and biotic stresses including drought, extremes in temperature, flooding, disease (bacterial, fungal, viral) and insect pests. Our primary research interest is to identify regulatory pathways that contribute to plant freezing tolerance and to use this information to improve the stress tolerance of plants. Our studies have focused on cold acclimation, the process whereby plants increase in freezing tolerance in response to low nonfreezing temperatures. With support from the USDA and other federal agencies, we developed Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter referred to as Arabidopsis) as a model plant to study cold acclimation and cold-regulated gene expression; discovered the CRT/DRE Binding Factor (CBF) regulatory pathway; established--along with many other labs--that the CBF pathway is highly conserved in plants; and have identified regulatory proteins that contribute to regulation of the CBF pathway in response to low temperature, the circadian clock, and photoperiod. In the current proposed research project, we will conduct multiple lines of investigation to identify molecular components of the low temperature  thermometer  that regulate expression of the CBF genes and will use natural genetic variation to identify novel pathways that contribute to cold acclimation.

1101,"Global food security is a major challenge of the 21st century. A doubling in food production in the next thirty years is required tofeed the estimated 9 billion people who will inhabitant the Earth in 2050. This can only be accomplished through increases inproduction of crops such as rice (Oryza sativa), the grain of which feeds billions of people. Although productivity of this vital crophas more than doubled per hectare since the 1960s, a significant further enhancement of production is essential. The most feasible way this can be achieved is by developing cultivars that can produce excellent yields despite sub-optimal environmental conditions such as temperature extremes, excess minerals, soil dehydration and flooding. To make agriculture more adaptive, we need a clear understanding of the genes and cellular mechanisms that facilitate maintenance of development and growth in a manner consistent with effective reproduction. These responses are controlled by the genetic make-up of the plant. Rice improvement is likely to have a profound impact on farmers in developing nations, as well as on California rice production. Our goal is to understand the cellular mechanisms that determine fitness under adverse growth conditions. The research project will focus on signaling mechanisms initiated by abiotic stress that result in altered gene regulation and development. We will further elucidate the sensing and response to flooding and drought and other abiotic stresses in rice, maize and the model plant Arabidopsis. The project will also develop and implement technology for high-resolution evaluation of gene expression and protein synthesis. The project will also study the function of genes that are poorly characterized in plants, but play a role in the response to abiotic stress.

1102,"Enhanced adaptation and mitigation of weeds is a growing threat to agriculture. Weeds, such as junglerice, have readily acquired resistance alleles and genetic mechanisms allowing them to sustain herbicide application, compete with the crop, and even mimic the crop. More interestingly, their abiotic stress response systems (drought tolerance, submergence, heat/temperature tolerance, etc.,) are often elite in comparison, because of longer periods of selection in the local environments. These genes, pathways, and expression networks and how these intersect are currently profound gaps in our understanding of how adaptive genetics of weed species intersects with environment and management practices. Improving crop production systems by tailoring the genetics of breeding germplasms for specific environments and studying the crop AND the surrounding weeds, is a sustainable solution to meet the growing challenges of agriculture and global sustainability.Because chemicals are highly effective in managing weeds, it has become the most popular option of weed control. However, with constant usage of herbicides in row crops, vegetable, and turf industry, very often these labeled herbicides cause significant injury on the crop itself, resulting in major yield loss. One of the good examples is tomato (Lypersicon esculentum), which is grown on over 444 acres across 627 farms in Mississippi (USDA, 2012), and although the crop is primarily grown in a plasticulture system (Pan et al., 1999), weeds are still a major problem in tomato production. Major weeds in tomato are yellow nutsedge, purple nutsedge, large crabgrass, and Palmer amaranth (Webster 2002). Among these weeds, yellow and purple nutsedge are the most problematic, causing significant yield losses and decreased fruit quality. Herbicide options in tomato are limited, and only a few are highly effective on nutsedge. These few herbicides that are labeled in tomato, show significant injury on the crop. Moreover, injury from herbicides drifted to greenhouse tomatoes leads to deformed fruits and yield reduction. Therefore, developing crops having tolerance to already labeled herbicides, and to herbicides that can potentially be drifted will improve quality and yield of the crop, and at the same time provide effective weed control.Row crops most commonly grown in Mississippi are cotton, soybean, corn, rice; while some commonly grown vegetables are tomato, sweet potato, and cucumber (USDA, 2012). In all of these crops, weed management has always been a major challenge to the growers. And with the introduction of herbicide-resistant crops technology, weeds are continuously exposed to selection pressure that results in weeds adapting to herbicide stress. Moreover, with the changing cropping systems that came along with the herbicide resistant technology, weeds have also found a way to adapt to the changes, thus rendering the herbicide-resistance technology ineffective. A survey conducted to determine how weed complexes have changed over time with change in management practices, showed that most of the weeds have evolved growth requirements and herbicide tolerances similar to the crop they infest (Loux and Berry 1991; McWhorter 1993). It would therefore be interesting to study how long the weeds take to evolve resistance to a particular herbicide. This will allow us to predict the time it takes herbicide-resistance technology to become ineffective since its commercialization. The objectives of the proposal will be to (1) develop a rapid assay to detect herbicide resistant weeds populations (non-destructive), identify mechanism of resistance, characterize competitive traits, biotic and biotic stress tolerance in weeds; (2) study the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds; (3) develop herbicide tolerant crops.

1103,"This project primarily serves growers of specialty crops and processors. Specialty crops are those that are grown in small acreage relative to major crops (apples, canola, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, grapes, rice, oranges, soybean, sunflower, turf, peanuts, potatoes, sugarcane, tomato, tobacco, and wheat). Specialty crops encompass minor use fruits, herbs and spices, tree nuts, ornamentals, and minor use vegetables. Because of their small acreage, and the large expense in registering pesticides, there is hardly no economic incentive for biological or chemical pesticide companies to develop the necessary database required for registration of their products on specialty crops. The need for pesticide registration in specialty crops and minor uses led to the formation of what used to be called the Interregional Project #4, or the IR-4 Project. Today, the Specialty Crops and Minor Use Program has expanded to also include pesticides needed to protect public health such as control of mosquitoes and ticks. Including all secondary impacts, the IR-4 Project is anticipated to support research and industry sales to support 104,650 U.S. jobs and increases annual gross domestic product by $7.3 billion (Miller and Leschewski 2012).The IR-4 project facilitates the examination of pesticide ingredients, crops and locations where pesticides will be used, the manner of use, and potential impact on consumers and nontarget organisms. The project helps ensure that any pesticide registered for specialty crops fall below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) allowed by EPA for food and feed. Recently, the IR-4 Project has provided about 50% of field and residue data for EPA&#39;s annual work plan and new clearances. About 70 - 80% of IR-4 Project&#39;s effort supports the registration of reduced-risk pesticides, thereby reducing the risk to human and environmental health relative to existing, or recently de-registered products (Viray and Hollingworth 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001a). Reduced risk pesticides are applied at lower rates than the older compounds; thus, volume of chemicals uses in fruit and vegetable production.The IR-4 Project has three programs: 1) Food, 2) Ornamental Horticulture, and 3) Biopesticides and Organic Support. Minor-use food crops (vegetables, melons, fruits, and tree nuts) comprise about 25% of total agricultural food crop production, worth about $33 billion annually. Without available modern pest management tools, losses of food and income are high.This proposed project is under the Food Use Program.

1104,"Seed dormancy and longevity are key adaptive traits of both ecological and agricultural importance. The goal of this continuing project is to elucidate genetic, evolutionary, physiological, and molecular mechanisms underlying the natural variation for the seed traits in grass species, ultimately to provide fundamental knowledge and novel genes to improve strategies for weed managements and in-situ and ex-situ seed conservations and to manipulate germination capability of cereal crops. The previous research developed weedy rice (Oryza sativa) as a genetic system to map and clone quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the seed biological traits. The objectives of this research are: 1) to complete cloning and molecular characterization of the seed dormancy loci qSD12 and qSD7-2 and 2) to identify QTL associated with the longevity of seeds stored under room conditions, or buried in soil under field conditions. To clone and characterize the QTL, rare recombinants for narrowed qSD12- or qSD7-2-containing regions will be used to isolate candidate genes, complementation and/or genome editing techniques used to confirm the dormancy function of the candidate genes, and transcriptomic analysis used to identify gene networks regulated by the confirmed genes. To identify QTL for seed longevity under storage conditions, a backcross population of seed samples aged at the room temperature for 10 years will be evaluated for seed viabilities and the phenotypic data associated with marker genotypes determined in the previous research. To identify QTL for seed longevity under field conditions, a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed in the previous research will be genotyped with DNA markers to develop a linkage map and also used to produce seeds. The seed samples will be buried in soil in a rice field on Southeast Missouri Rice Research Farm for one year or longer time to evaluate seed viability for QTL mapping. The research will provide new knowledge about these two seed biological traits, and the knowledge shared with weed and seed scientists, crop breeders, and seed biologists. This project will also generate new germplasm for crop breeding. aged; Agriculture; Backcrossings; Biological; Breeding; Candidate Disease Gene; Cereals; Chromosome Mapping; DNA Markers; Farming environment; gene complementation; Genes; Genetic; genome editing; Genotype; Germination; Goals; improved; In Situ; Inbreeding; Knowledge; Longevity; Maps; Missouri; Molecular; Molecular Cloning; novel; Oryza sativa; phenotypic data; Physiological; Poaceae; Population; Quantitative Trait Loci; Recombinants; Research; Rice; Sampling; Scientist; Seeds; Soil; System; Techniques; Temperature; Time; trait; transcriptomics; VariantUNDERSTANDING GENETIC CONTROLS OF SEED DORMANCY AND LONGEVITY IN GRASS SPECIES",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.9999818393446024
1105,"Initially, much of this project will be built upon the strong relationship between the author and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), built through previous employment at IDB. IDB is the largest multi-lateral provider of development funding to Latin America and the Caribbean. IDB also has a strong interest in accumulating credible evidence for the effectiveness of the policies supported by its loan portfolio, and is willing to invest substantial resources into the design of impact evaluations and data collection. This partnership has already yielded one article soon to be published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics (Mullally &amp; Maffioli, 2015)Two additional research projects with IDB are currently underway. The first is an evaluation of a program in eastern Guatemala that combines Farmer Field Schools (FFS) with the transfer of chickens to participating households. In the program, the local agricultural university (CUNORI) and the local development authority (Mancomunidad Cop&aacute;n Chort&iacute;, or MCC) organize and administer FFS in selected local communities. FFS modules include agroforestry, basic grain production, marketing, and poultry management. Upon completing the poultry management modules, dedicating a small area to planting forage, and constructing a chicken coup, households receive a  poultry set,  consisting of nine hens and one rooster. The chickens are of the  Cuello Desnudo  variety (naked neck), supposedly more robust to the climate of the region in Guatemala where the project is being executed than varieties typically used in US egg-laying operations, for example. In exchange for receiving the poultry set, households must agree to deliver a poultry set back to the program, which will then be given to another household that has completed the poultry module at their local FFS.For a large subset of communities that will participate in the program, the order of participation was randomized. Program resources were not sufficient to intervene in all communities simultaneously, and MCC agreed to select the order of participation 68 communities at random in order to generate credible evaluation of the program. The evaluation will measure program effects by comparing outcomes in 21 communities randomly selected to enter the program in 2014 to 21 communities randomly selected to enter in 2016. As long as household outcomes are not affected by anticipation of receiving program benefits, this  randomized phase-in  design can be used to estimate the average impact of the program on a variety of indicators, and these estimates will be free of selection bias that might affect estimates if we surrendered control over the order of intervention. Baseline data collection for the evaluation was completed in 2014, and follow-up data will be collected in 2016, after the treatment group has been in the program for a year and a half and just prior to the entry of the control group into the program. The evaluation will measure the impact of the program on agricultural production and income, knowledge of production practices, household consumption, and anthropometric indicators. The richly detailed household questionnaire used for the evaluation will allow me to discern which factors helped or hindered the ability of households to benefit from the program.The second project is an evaluation of a rural electrification project in Suriname, also funded in part by IDB. Outside the capital of Paramaribo and other urban centers, villages receive power from generators fueled by shipments of free diesel from the government; individuals sometimes have their own generators as well. Fuel shortages and equipment breakdowns are frequent; in general, rural areas have around five hours of electricity per day, strictly in the evening, and service is weak and highly unreliable. In order to improve access to high quality, reliable electricity, the government of Suriname is extending its national electric grid to rural areas that are reasonably close to the capital of Paramaribo and upgrading generators in rural areas too remote to be reached by the grid in a cost effective manner.The evaluation of the electrification project will measure the effects of improved electrical service on five villages in Suriname. The evaluation will use the method of difference-in-differences, comparing changes in outcomes from pre-intervention to two years post-intervention in the villages selected to receive improved electricity with changes in outcomes in 12 control villages not selected to receive improved electricity. Control villages were selected on the basis of having access to electricity, infrastructure, economic activities, population sizes, and ethnic mixes that are similar to those of the villages selected to receive improved electricity. Baseline data for the evaluation will be collected in the summer of 2015, and follow-up data will be collected in summer 2017. While the evaluation in Suriname is not focused on extension, many households in the program villages and control villages earn their living through agriculture, producing pineapple, rice, and cassava. The introduction of improved electricity could remove a constraint on agricultural development. For example, pineapple producers may now be able to afford refrigeration at their collection centers, potentially making it easier to sell to Paramaribo or export markets.

1106,"A population growth more than tripled in 20th century will continue demanding the sustainability of crop production to keep the food and energy more abundant. To address how the crop plants can be most efficiently produced, one most prevailing measure would be a better control of virus transmission in the crop field. Rice Dwarf Virus (RDV), a vector-borne plant reovirus, is mainly transmitted by leafhopper. Here, the control of viral genome transcription, thus the virus spread at the point of replication, is much more direct than that of the costly control of plant pests (by often relying on elements of potential burden to the environment). As the viral genome, enclosed within the capsid in the host cellular environment, has to be replicated and released to get access to cellular machinery for macromolecular synthesis, the knowledge change by the proposed investigation will help designing ways of blocking the viral genome-encoded information into enzymatic and accessory proteins needed in its replication. Structural modularity in tertiary or quaternary order provides us the descriptors to observe the metastable conformations of complex macromolecules, including the virus replication inside the host cells. However, due to the dynamics of the viral structural features, currently the knowledge of detailed mechanism in viral genome release has been very limited this far. The software toolboxes developed for our 3D tomography reconstruction and viral structural analysis will be utilized aiming to show the simultaneous release of the RNA transcripts based on our established model viruses. In a broader sense, we anticipate this project will allow us the sharing with the community both the analytical tools and the new insights in illustrating the structural events across the modalities to better understand, and thus to better control, virus transmission in the field.

1107,"Numerous diseases pose major threats to rice (Oryzae sativa L.) production. In Louisiana, sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn), ), blast (Pyricularia grisea Sacc.), and narrow brown leaf spot (Cercospora oryzae (Racib.) O. Const.) continue to be the most important ricediseasescausing significant yield and quality reductionscosting farmers millions of dollars each year. Narrow brown leaf spot developed into a major pest during the 2006 growing season, and since that year, it has been problematic in later-planted rice andsecond crop production. In 2010 and 2011, the strobilurin fungicide-resistant sheath blight pathogen was detected in Acadia Parish. Recently, in 2012 and 2015, major blast epidemics developed on several major rice varieties causing significant damage. Information is critically needed on these disease pests and their interactions to determine best managementpractices. Data from inoculated research plots and surveys in farmers&#39; fields suggest that these rice diseases cause an average 6 to 25% loss each year in yield and quality. Direct losses to disease include thin stands, lodging, spotted kernels, fewer and smaller grains, reduced milling, and a general reduction in plant efficiency.Indirect losses include the cost of pesticides used to manage diseases, application costs, and reduced yields associated with special cultural control practices that reduce disease but may not be conducive to producing maximum yields. With present production costs and the low rice prices, yield and quality losses can represent negative net returns due to rice diseases. Development of effective disease management practices willincrease the netreturns.

1108,"In the U.S., rice is grown on an average of 2.6M acres producing approximately 10M tons of grain per year, equivalent to $3.6B in market value, largely in the southern states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Texas. Rice is an important component of a healthy diet, and it is a key to maintaining global food security. A number of challenges, however, face rice production both in the U.S. and around the world, including constraints in water supplies, emerging pests and diseases, increasing costs of inputs, and plateauing yields. At the same time, environmentally sustainable ways need to be found to produce enough food for 9.6 billion people by 2050 without converting additional land to rice production. There are also several areas where the nutritional content and healthiness of rice can be further improved. Thankfully, recent scientific advances in rice research and new plant breeding technologies now provide faster and more powerful ways to develop higher yielding, stress tolerant and more nutritious rice varieties.This project will take advantage of the latest advances in rice genetics, whole genome sequencing, and information technology to better explore the wealth of biodiversity available in rice and its wild relatives and identify new genes for rice improvement. It will leverage recent investments in plant genomics and work closely with rice breeders to bridge the gaps between genetic resources and plant breeding, between genomic discovery and application, and between the US and global rice research communities. The approaches will include testing exotic rice accessions, mapping novel genes, analyzing DNA sequence data, developing new pre-breeding materials, and helping rice breeders use the latest molecular marker technologies to speed up the process to develop improved rice varieties. The ultimate goals of the project will be to increase the competitiveness of US rice on the global market through lower production costs and superior grain quality, to improve the nutritional quality of rice for improved healthiness of rice consumers, to work with international partners to help secure a stable supply of rice around the world in the face of future constraints, and to support more environmentally sustainable methods of rice production.

1109,"Rice is cultivated worldwide and a staple food for nearly half of humanity. The United States is a major rice exporter, with nearly half of its rice production being exported. Rice in the U.S. is primarily produced by five states in the South: Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas, as well as California. Texas rice production contributes to about 5% to 7% of the rice supply in the US, with more than 95% being long grain rice for domestic and export markets. This totals nearly $160 million in production value and contributed about $500 million to $600 million to the economy of Texas. However, increasing problems in rice cultivation have been faced by Texas rice farmers and rice growers around the world. Water shortages in some parts of the state have brought about uncertainty in rice cultivation.Prolonged cold weather early in the season can also delay rice planting and slow down the growth of rice crops, which in turns affects rice yields. Weeds have also been a major problem, even with the widespread use of herbicides and non-chemical measures. Globally, rice production must increase to keep up with population growth and world food security challenges to feed nine billion people by 2050. With limited available land and water for cultivation expansion, the bulk of future increases has to be achieved from intensification of cultivation. Further, global rice cultivation is facing ever-growing challenges, such as abiotic and biotic stresses, that may worsen from increasingly volatile climatic conditions. Abiotic stresses, such as drought, flooding, heat, UV radiation, cold, and salinity, threaten rice production and food security around the globe. This problem is often accompanied by the onset of diseases and insects that further make rice cultivation more vulnerable. Plateauing yields are another challenge facing the future of rice cultivation, along with the need to improve grain quality for better milling and end-user preferences for the premium rice markets.Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) is planted on 21 million hectares world-wide and is distinguished by high oil content with a large percentage of oleic acid. Peanut contributes more than $4 billion to the Unites States economy yearly and Americans spend nearly $800 million a year on peanut butter; meanwhile, peanuts are also one of the key ingredients in many snacks consumed in the US. Peanuts in the U.S. are mainly grown in the seven states, e.g. Georgia, Texas, Alabama, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia and Oklahoma. In 2014, peanuts were planted in 52,600 hectares in Texas, with total production of 208,534 metric tons, and a value production of $135,439,000. Peanut production, however, was often hampered by diseases including leafspot, stem rot and pod rot, insects and abiotic stresses, such as drought, and weed invasion. Improvements of production costs, nutrition and overall quality have also been important issues. Food allergies are also on the rise, including allergy to peanuts products, which in the U.S. affects 2% to 10% children.At the same time, with the advances in genomics technologies and next generation sequencing, new opportunities to speed up crop improvement have arisen. A wealth of rice germplasm in the genebanks worldwide are ready to be tapped for rice improvement, which is composed of 21 wild and 2 domesticatedspecies and 10 distinct genome types. On the other hand, cultivated peanut has a very narrow genetic base; however, wild diploid Arachis are highly diverse which provides a rich source of variation for useful agronomic traits and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. This project will use genomics tools towards improving rice andpeanuts. These strategies include using diverse or exotic germpaslm in ourresearch to identify novel genes/alleles through DNA maker-trait association, genome-wide gene expression studies to identify genes/pathways associated with the traits of interest,and/or genome editing by cutting the target genomic sequence to either abolish the function of the gene to validateits function or to replace the specific gene with a better one to improve the traits of interest.This project will work towards the following goals: (i) to help stabilize yield production of direct-seeded rice both in Texas and globally; (ii) to help safeguard rice production and food security worldwide; (iii) to improve rice grain quality as premium market in the U.S. and globally; and (iv) to improve peanuts crop productivity and economic competitiveness for Texas and the southern U.S. Affect; Alabama; Alleles; Allergy to peanuts; American; Arachis; Arkansas; base; Butter; California; Cereals; Chemicals; Child; Climate; cost; Diploidy; Disease; DNA; Droughts; Economics; farmer; feeding; Floods; Florida; Food; Food Hypersensitivity; food security; Future; Gene Expression; gene function; Genes; Genetic; Genome; genome editing; genome wide association study; genomic tools; Genomics; Goals; Growth; Hand; Heating; Herbicides; Humanities; improved; insect disease; Insecta; interest; Louisiana; Marketing; Measures; Mississippi; Missouri; Molecular Genetics; next generation sequencing; North Carolina; novel; nutrition; Oils; Oklahoma; Oleic Acids; Onset of illness; Pathway interactions; Plants; Population Growth; preference; Production; Productivity; Rice; Seasons; Source; Speed; stem; Stress; Technology; Texas; Time; trait; Ultraviolet Rays; Uncertainty; United States; Variant; Virginia; Water; Weather; WorkRICE AND PEANUT IMPROVEMENT THROUGH MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMIC TOOLS",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999
1110,"The Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) is a highly productive area south of Lake Okeechobee in southern Florida within the larger Everglades system. It is situated within Palm Beach County and Hendry County and is dominated by sugarcane, sweet corn, rice, sod, and winter vegetable farming due to its highly organic muck soils and subtropical climate. Once formerly sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) marshes, the low topography, variable seasonal rainfall, and highly organic wetland soils required an intricate series of canals, levees, pumps, and control structures to be built to optimize soil and water table conditions for agriculture. Phosphorus (P) applied as fertilizer is carried with agricultural drainage water and is considered one of the leading causes of nutrient enrichment in the downstream Stormwater Treatment Area (STAs), and Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and the Everglades National Park (ENP). The P-enriched drainage water has resulted in an ecological shift from oligotrophic, or nutrient poor, to eutrophic, or nutrient rich, ecosystems in the downstream Everglades. This shift in nutrient regime has shifted vegetative communities from sawgrass marshes to predominately cattail (Typha latifolia) monocultures.To combat the increasing concentration of P in EAA discharge waters, a best management practice (BMP) program was established in 1994 by the Everglades Forever Act (Chapter 373, Florida Statutes, Section 373.4592, 1994) requiring a 25% reduction in P loads relative to a designated baseline. Best management practices are the primary method to control stormwater discharge, which is water that flows over land during precipitation events. As the water flows over land, nutrients, contaminants, sediment, chemicals, and other debris are accumulated in the water and are carried into receiving waterbodies. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) has charged the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) with the development, implementation, and monitoring of the EAA BMP program. The program has been highly successful in meeting and exceeding the 25% reduction requirement for 20 consecutive years. But there are still farms and sub basins with high P concentrations and loads that may overtax the STAs and WCAs and affecting the ENP. Achieving further reductions in P transport from EAA farms can be done by focusing management on canal sediments and particulates to which P adsorbs.The purpose of this research is to provide a new understanding of the impacts of floating aquatic vegetation (FAV) on canal sediments characteristics including phosphorus (P) pools and potential transport off farm in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) of south Florida. Floating aquatic vegetation are able to store high concentrations of P taken up from the water column or canal sediments, depending on location of plant roots. After maximum P uptake is achieved in the beginning of the growing season, FAV can become a source of P during decomposition. There has yet to be a study done to show the effects of FAV, such as water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), and duckweed (Lemna valdiviana) suppression on canal sediments as a farm management tool in the EAA, and this study will serve to fill the knowledge gap in assessing this action as a means of reducing labile P export from farm canals.This study is conducted on eight cooperating farms in the EAA. The implications of this study include assessing the feasibility of floating aquatic vegetation BMP to provide farmers another tool for their BMP farm management plans, and whether or not the basin-wide implementation of a FAV-control BMP would have a significant effect on EAA P export. The success of the BMP program in the EAA is a critical component in achieving Everglades restoration in south Florida.

1111,"Executive SummaryRice production in Mississippi is a hundred million dollar industry with the area planted to rice averaging 208,000 acres in the last 12 years (2003-2014). The choice of rice variety to plant is a key management decision that each grower must make each year. The high seed cost of new hybrid and herbicide technology-based systems has recently increased demand for better and affordable conventional variety options. For example, the pureline cultivar Rex, that was released by MSU in 2010, has steadily increased in acreage - up to 15% by 2013 (MAFES, 2013). Based on this market share and acreage, an annual increase of $1.02 million in cash receipts and regional economic impact of $1.38 million is being contributed by Rex alone (DREC, 2014). This proposal, therefore, seeks to further strengthen and modernize the rice breeding program at DREC in order to supply, on a long-term, sustainable, and affordable bases, the varietal requirements of Mississippi rice producers. The program will aim to (a) develop conventional pureline varieties with high yield, excellent grain quality, and resistance/tolerance to a suite of biotic and abiotic stresses; (b) develop pureline varieties with special traits such as herbicide tolerance and cereal chemistry profiles that are desired by specific producers and end-users; (c) identify locally-bred and introduced cultivars that are well-adapted to the rice-growing conditions of the Mississippi Delta; and (d) understand the genetic basis of key traits for use in breeding and broadening the genetic base of Mississippi rice varieties. To achieve these objectives, the project will utilize both classical breeding techniques in combination with molecular breeding approaches. Classical breeding techniques will include pedigree selection, rapid generation advance, shuttle breeding, and multi-environment testing. Molecular breeding approaches will include genetic mapping of major genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying key traits, molecular marker development, and marker-assisted selection. Novel approaches for recombining favorable genes and QTLs, such as the multiparent advanced generation intercross or MAGIC approach will be employed. A breeding data management system will also be developed for tracking breeding progress, from parental selection, crossing, generation advancement, testing, to cultivar release and for streamlining all activities in the variety development pipeline. This project will have a timeframe of ten (10) years - the normative time required for breeding a rice cultivar (IRRI, 2013). Project funding will be sought from the Mississippi Rice Promotion Board, MAFES, and other donors as opportunities arise. Project execution will be led by the Principal Investigator who will be assisted by a DREC breeding team and who will collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of rice scientists both at DREC and in other research institutions and universities in the US and abroad. Intellectual property generated will be documented in the form of technical publications, plant variety registrations, and patents, to be shared, as appropriate, with concerned stakeholders.

1112,"High-throughput genomic technologies in plant sciences generate vast amounts of DNA sequence data from diverse plants as well as genotypic variability within a crop. In addition, functional genomics information on gene expression is generated, describing different stages, conditions and responses of plants. Analysis of this data will provide new tools and knowledge to improve sustainable crop production in our changing environment. Abiotic and biotic stress resistance/tolerance, yield stability, and quality or composition of rice products will be studied. Traits such as drought resistance and water use efficiency are complex and need to be studied in a holistic integrated manner. Rice genotypes, differing in phenotype for these traits and components will be developed from crosses of diverse germplasm, or selected as mutations of candidate genes for the trait. The different genotypes, displaying quantitative phenotypic differences for the traits, will be used in progressive steps to characterize the association of candidate genes to trait phenotypes. Candidate genes for the traits will be validated by multiple criteria. This integrated analysis will provide an understanding of the biology of these traits. The Outcomes of the project will be - 1: the identification of genes involved in traits for sustainable rice and cereal crop production, and 2: the identification of genetic variation within the germplasm that can be used by breeders to select genotypes for trait improvement. The Impact of the project will be the potential development of future rice and cereal cultivars with improved environmental stress tolerance and yield stability.

1113,"Over 80 million acres of field corn (Zea mays) and 600,000 acres of sweet corn, worth about $65 billion and $1 billion respectively, are grown in the U.S. each year. The European corn borer (ECB) (Ostrinia nubilalis) and western corn rootworm (WCR) (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) account for over $1 billion each in control costs and grain losses annually. Rootworms are particularly problematic because of their propensity to evolve resistance to management tactics, including crop rotation (Gray et al. 2009), insecticides (Meinke et al. 1998), and now Bt toxins (Gassmann et al. 2011, 2014).Since the commercial release of Bt transgenic corn against ECB in 1996 and against rootworms in 2004, a revolution in corn insect pest management has occurred. Seed companies continue to develop genetically-modified (GM) crops for pest protection. New GM corn hybrids have resistance to a broader range of lepidopteran pests, some have resistance to coleopteran pests, and most current GM hybrids have genes targeting both Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. This technology often eliminates the need to store and handle insecticides and it increases the efficiency of grower operations and pest control (Rice 2004, Sappington 2014). However, the development of resistance by WCR to some Bt toxins is threatening to reverse these gains. Keeping abreast of these changes with timely and relevant research over an area as large and diverse as the U.S. Corn Belt lends itself to a coordinated, committee approach.Bt corn acreage in the U.S. has increased from 8% in 1997 to 80% in 2014. At this level of adoption, the potential for resistance increases. Research conducted by this committee was used to develop models predicting the rates of resistance evolution and efficacy of refuge in preventing resistance. This led to the IRM approach that used a 20% independent refuge planting; however, as GM technology has evolved, so has IRM. Recently deployed GM corn hybrids use multiple genes that target ECB and WCR. The IRM plan for these hybrids requires a smaller refuge, and seed mixtures (Bt and non-BT) are now being deployed. The models supporting these IRM modifications were constructed using the best information available, but a number of assumptions had to be made. These assumptions must be tested and research conducted to move them from assumptions to quantified variables. Furthermore, information is needed on the economics of this evolving technology at the field, farm, and regional levels. Addressing these knowledge gaps forms the basis for several objectives of the project. The long-term goal of our research is to develop sustainable ways to manage the corn insect pest complex. This is a high regional priority, and in the context of demonstrating sustainable practices, it also is an important national priority.

1114,"Rice is an important food source for more than half of the world&#39;s population, yet the yield and its sustainability is continuously challenged by a myriad of abiotic and biotic stresses causing economic losses of billions of dollars per year. Ethylene influences plant growth and development and especially plays a critical role in stress responses. Understanding the specific role of ACC syntheses which regulate the rate-limiting process of the pathway will uncover how plants utilize ethylene to adapt to multiple environmental challenges. Elucidation of the mechanism underlying the crosstalk between ethylene and gibberellin also could bring a new insight into the understanding in rice internode elongation in flood stress, one of the serious abiotic stresses resulting in yield loss of rice. Together, results from these studies will enable us to enhance stress resistance traits and improve the yield and sustainability of the rice. biological adaptation to stress; Economics; Ethylenes; Floods; Food; Gibberellins; improved; insight; Pathway interactions; plant growth/development; Plants; Play; Population; Process; Resistance; Rice; Role; Source; Stress; traitETHYLENE REGULATED STRESS RESPONSES IN RICE",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999
1115,"This proposal is about programmed cell death and sex determination in maize and the grass family. Programmed cell death is best defined as genetically encoded, actively controlled cellular suicide. Programmed cell death is of fundamental importance in plant development. For example, xylem cells undergo programmed cell death and create an interconnected network of hollow tubes essential for water transport. Despite its importance, developmentally regulated programmed cell death is far less understood than processes like cell division and differentiation (reviewed in Van Hautegem et al., 2015).In the grasses, programmed cell death has a particular role to play in floral development. Maize flowers are initially hermaphroditic, but become either male or female through differential organ abortion. In male flowers, the female floral organs (the carpels) stop growing after they have formed, and eventually undergo programmed cell death. Programmed cell death in the carpels of the male maize floret is partially under the control of the transcription factor grassy tillers1. In gt1 mutants, the carpels in male flowers do not abort completely (Whipple et al.; Bartlett et al., 2015). However, gt1 mutant flowers are not fully hermaphroditic, indicating the existence of other genes that act with gt1 to regulate carpel abortion and programmed cell death. Which other genes are involved in carpel abortion? How do they interact with known sex determination genes in maize?We have designed a series of genetic experiments geared at answering these questions. We will use mutant analysis to investigate whether gt1 is part of known sex determination pathways in maize. In addition, we have isolated four maize mutants where the gt1 mutant phenotype is strongly enhanced and programmed cell death in male flowers is disrupted. Using genetic and genomic tools, we will identify the genes that have been disrupted in these mutants, and work to determine their precise roles in mediating growth repression and programmed cell death.Surprisingly, gt1-like genes control growth repression and organ abortion not only in maize, but also in barley (a grass distantly related to maize) (Komatsuda et al., 2007), and even in persimmons (separated from grasses by more than 200 million years) (Akagi et al., 2014). In maize, barley, and persimmons, gt1- like genes are associated with the development of sterile or male flowers. However, sterile or male flowers have evolved separately in each lineage. Have gt1-like genes been repeatedly deployed throughout evolution to mediate floral sexuality? We will explore the expression of gt1-like genes in grass flowers from species spanning grass diversity.This sex determination project is uniquely suited for the Hatch program because it has the potential to considerably advance our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of grass development, while at the same time having transformative applications for crop design. Once we understand how growth repression is controlled in maize and other grasses, there is the potential for deactivating and activating growth repression at will, and drastically increasing cereal productivity. For example, rice flowers are hermaphroditic, which makes generating hybrid rice challenging. Targeted regulation of floral organ abortion has the potential to jump start hybrid rice breeding. Indeed, gt1-like genes were the targets of selection by ancient agronomists in both barley and maize [Komatsuda, 2007 #2179;Whipple, 2011 #2928;Wills, 2013 #3443]. As modern plant scientists, we can use our understanding of the genes and gene networks controlling plant development for rational crop design. abortion; Apoptosis; Barley; Basic Science; Breeding; Cell division; cell suicide; Cells; Cereals; design; Development; Diospyros; Evolution; Family; Female; Flowers; Genes; Genetic; genomic tools; Growth; hatching; Hybrids; Knowledge; Maize; male; Mediating; mutant; Organ; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; plant growth/development; Plants; Play; Poaceae; Process; Productivity; programs; Regulation; Repression; research study; Rice; Role; Scientist; Series; sex determination; Sexuality; Sterility; Time; transcription factor; Tube; Water; Work; xylemPROGRAMMED CELL DEATH IN GRASS FLOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION: LEVERAGING BASIC RESEARCH INTO RATIONAL CROP DESIGN",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
1116,"Genomic selection is a statistical method to predict genetic values of plants, animals or human beings using genomic (marker) data. It is a form of marker assisted selection except that markers of the whole genome are simultaneously used to facilitate selection rather than relying on a few statistically significant markers. Genomic selection does not need pedigrees and thus can be used widely in almost all populations, can be performed without phenotypic values and thus leads to cost saving, can be performed using parent genotypes only leading to efficient hybrid breeding. The long term goal of this project is to develop advanced statistical methods for genomic selection. There are five specific goals in the proposed project, which are described below. (1) Develop advanced statistical methods for genomic selection; (2) Train the statistical models and methods using a hybrid population of rice consisting of 1495 hybrids derived from the crosses of indica x indica, indica x japonica and japonica x japonica. (3) Predict grain yield and other important traits of rice for all 4,498,500 potential hybrids of 3000 varieties of rice from the 3000 rice genome project; (4) Validate the predicted traits using currently available crosses from the 3000 varieties; (5) Develop a new software package in R to perform genomic selection and hybrid prediction. The new genomic selection methods and tools can be applied to all crops where hybrid breeding is the main approach for genetic improvement. Maize and rice are two of the most important crops in the world where hybrid breeding is most important than conventional breeding.

1117,"Soybean is one of the most important crop species in Virginia and the United States (http://vasoybean.com/) and accounts for over 30% of the crop growing area (http://soystats.com). In the state of Virginia, soybeans are grown on over half a million acres (600,000 acres in 2014) and theworth exceeds $200 million annually.Soybean seeds are a major source of protein and oil, and have been widely used in food production and animal feeding (Barrett 2006). Although the productivity of soybeans has been steadily increasing over the past 30 years, significant challenges remain in the future improvement of the productivity under ever-changing environmental conditions (Deshmukh et al. 2014). The development of new genomic technologies, play akey role in global food security and sustainable agriculture (Michael and VanBuren 2015). In contrast to traditional molecular biology techniques, where a small number of genes, proteins or metabolites are analyzed simultaneously, genomic technologies allow scientists to generate data at the whole genome scale.This has the potential to advance systematic understanding of biological mechanisms and significantly accelerate crop improvement. For example, genome sequencing can provide tens of thousands of genetic markers that enhances the power of marker-assisted breeding (Morrell, Buckler, and Ross-Ibarra 2011; Deshmukh et al. 2014). Transcriptome profiling with RNA sequencing can quantify changes of all genes for a given species, allowing the identification of key genes torespondto stress or other environmental conditions (Huang et al. 2014; Rodrigues et al. 2015; Wakasa et al. 2014).During the past few years, the cost of obtaining genomic information using next generation sequencing technology has reduced dramatically (Edwards, Batley, and Snowdon 2013). Because of this, genomic information such as reference genome sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms, epigenomic modifications, and transcriptome profiles, have become readily available for many crop species. The challenge is how to translate the  big data  into knowledge of gene functions and genetic variation, and to apply such knowledge to facilitate a mechanical understandingof crop improvement. Bioinformatics and computational biology, play a fundamental role in this process. Using tools of statistical inference and machine learning, bioinformatics is the principled approach for data mining on genomics data to identify genes and genetic variations that underlie traits of economical importance. For example, RNAseq and genome re-sequencing data, have been used to identify genes involved in regulation of seed oil content (Goettel et al. 2014) or seed development (Fan et al. 2013). In the past few decades, most gene functions and molecular mechanisms in plants, have been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana (Krishnakumar et al. 2015), a model plant species. As compared to Arabidopsis, genetic experiments for crops are typically more time consuming (Edwards, Batley, and Snowdon 2013). Unlike traditional genetic experiments, genomic experiments such as RNA sequencing are fast and can now be routinely performed in a variety of crops species. However, crop genomes are typically more complex than Arabidopsis, thus new bioinformatics tools and databases are needed to help breeders and other plant scientists to analyze and interpret genomic data in order to better understand the information embedded in such data. One of the main functions of these tools will be to compare crop species and Arabidopsis in order to identify key genes and pathways that are conserved and involved in important biological processes, such as seed filling, seed germination, disease resistance, and drought/flood tolerance.In the next five years, my lab will focus on building bioinformatic platforms (Figure 1) that enable scientists to extract information from comparative genomic data and to facilitate crop improvement. We will use soybean (Glycine max) as a model system to build our bioinformatics resources and pipelines. We will focus on three biological processes: seed development, stress tolerance and microbial interactions. Seed development is the key process that is related to the product quality of soybeans. Environmental stresses such as drought and flood are major abiotic factors that negatively impact soybean productivity. As a legume species, soybean-microbial interactions are crucial for the process of nitrogen fixation and determines the protein content of soybean seeds. Many research groups at Virginia Tech as well as in other institutions have studied these biological processes, and have already generated ample amount of sequencing data for soybean and Arabidopsis. We will use these existing data in our research. The bioinformatics platform developed in this project can be easily extended to analyze data from other crop species such as maize, rice and wheat.

1118,"Relative to adults, the developing nervous system is highly vulnerable to chemically-induced injury due to increased permeability of the blood:brain barrier, increased absorption capacity, reduced metabolism, and dynamic yet tightly regulated construction of the neural network (Rice and Barone 2000; Tilson 2000). Indeed, environmental exposures are thought to be associated with an increase in complex neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism within the United States (Grandjean and Landrigan 2014). However, there are minimal to no developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) data available for thousands of chemicals used in commerce (Grandjean and Landrigan 2006), and only approximately 150 substances (mostly pesticides) have been tested using standardized DNT test guidelines (Smirnova et al. 2014). Therefore, there are significant uncertainties about the potential risk of neurodevelopmental exposure to environmental chemicals such as currently used pesticides and high-production volume chemicals. While DNT testing may help reduce these uncertainties, it is impractical nor feasible to screen hundreds to thousands of chemicals using the existing DNT test guideline (OECD TG 426), as each chemical requires 640 to 1200 rats (excluding dams), ~$1.4 million USD, and approximately three months (Smirnova et al. 2014). Therefore, to begin addressing this challenge, over the last decade the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) at Johns Hopkins University and European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) have led a global discussion on identifying potential alternative methods for screening and prioritization of chemicals for DNT testing, with the most recent international conference (TestSmart DNT4) convened in Philadelphia in May 2014.As a result of these discussions, there is now a recognized need to rely on cell-based assays and alternative non-mammalian models to support screening and prioritization of chemicals for DNT testing in rodents. To this end, we recently developed a first-generation high-content screening (HCS) assay that quantifies spontaneous activity - the first sign of locomotion - within single zebrafish embryos after exposure to chemicals in concentration-response format (Raftery et al. 2014). Within this assay, 192 viable embryos are manually arrayed into a 384-well plate over a 20-minute time period, resulting in one embryo per well and 16 initial embryos per treatment. Following static exposure from 5 to 25 hpf, automated image acquisition procedures and custom analysis protocols are then used to quantify spontaneous activity within live, non-malformed embryos. Although survival and imaging success rates are &gt;85% and the total assay duration is &lt;30 hours, we have observed a high degree of natural variability in the percent of control embryos exhibiting spontaneous activity despite efforts to control for developmental stage, temperature, and light conditions. Moreover, initial attempts to use 384 embryos per plate were unsuccessful due to prolonged image acquisition times, resulting in across-plate variation in spontaneous activity.To address these challenges head-on, the objective of this project is to develop and validate a second-generation, embryo-based HCS assay that utilizes an entire 384-well plate while simultaneously increasing statistical power and assay throughput. We will accomplish the objective of this project by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Develop a second-generation HCS assay for rapid identification of neuroactive chemicals; 2) Identify molecular initiating events (MIEs) impacting spontaneous activity during early embryogenesis; and 3) Determine the predictive power of embryo-based behavioral screening for DNT identification. The proposed research is innovative because, for the first time, we will develop and validate a second-generation, embryo-based HCS assay that (1) utilizes an entire 384-well plate while simultaneously increasing statistical power and assay throughput; (2) relies on a behavioral readout (spontaneous activity) that has the potential to detect multiple MIEs within a physiologically relevant, intact organism; and (3) compared to existing zebrafish-based locomotion assays conducted within 96-well plates, provides shorter exposure durations and decreased treatment solution volumes needed for screening. This contribution is significant because it will (1) enable our lab to discover novel DNT-positive compounds (such as pesticides) for future hypothesis-driven, mechanistic studies; (2) provide the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), National Toxicology Program (NTP) and Tox21 program with a rapid and streamlined behavioral screening assay; and (3) complement existing global efforts to develop and deploy cell-based HCS assays as alternatives to DNT testing. absorption; Address; Adult; Agriculture; Animal Testing; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Autistic Disorder; base; Behavioral; Biological Assay; Biological Neural Networks; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Cells; Chemicals; Commerce; Complement 3; Complex; Custom; Data; Development; developmental neurotoxicity; Embryo; Embryonic Development; environmental chemical; Environmental Exposure; European; Event; Exhibits; Exposure to; Food; Future; Generations; Guidelines; Head; Hour; Image; Injury; innovation; Institutes; International; Life; Light; Locomotion; Metabolism; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; National Toxicology Program; Nervous system structure; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; novel; Organism; Permeability; Pesticides; Philadelphia; Procedures; Production; programs; Protocols documentation; Rattus; Research; response; Rice; Risk; Rodent; screening; Staging; success; symposium; Temperature; Testing; Time; Uncertainty; United States; Universities; Validation; Variant; ZebrafishHIGH-CONTENT SCREENING OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROTOXICITY OF CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS USING ZEBRAFISH AS A VERTEBRATE MODEL",0.00014245169962470803,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06
1119,"Many plant diseases are predicted to intensify as environmental temperatures increase, and many widely used single gene sources of disease resistance (R genes) are less effective at high temperatures. While the phenomenon of temperature-induced susceptibility is well documented, the mechanisms are not known. For example, high temperatures are conducive to bacterial blight (BB) disease of rice caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, and most R genes are less effective at controlling disease at high relative to low temperature regimes. We will investigate the mechanisms behind increased disease at high temperatures. Preliminary data suggest that high temperatures cause an increased expression of genes that mediate disease susceptibility and decreased expression of genes that mediate disease resistance, and that these changes might contribute to increased BB disease. In the proposed studies, the impact of high temperatures on rice gene expression during X. oryzae infection will be determined. Transcriptome analyses and phenotypic assays will be used to ask if, over time, high temperatures induce disease susceptibility genes, suppress defense pathways important to R gene-mediated resistance, alter primary metabolism to enhance disease, and/or activate abiotic stress response genes. Second, the transcriptome and phenotypic data will be integrated using a co-expression network analysis to identify common components and master regulators of high temperature and pathogen stress responses. Future steps will be to validate the function of predicted genes at the network nodes. biological adaptation to stress; Biological Assay; cold temperature; Data; Disease; Disease Resistance; Disease susceptibility; disorder control; Future; Gene Expression; Genes; High temperature of physical object; Infection; Mediating; Metabolism; Oryza; pathogen; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; phenotypic data; Plant Diseases; Plants; Predisposition; Resistance; Rice; Source; Susceptibility Gene; System; Temperature; Time; transcriptome; vpr Genes; XanthomonasA SYSTEMS APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING COMBINED BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESS RESPONSES IN PLANTS",1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.35341410884513863

1121,"The Appropriate Scale Mechanization Consortium (ASMC) will introduce multifunctional andmodular mechanized technologies that are technically, environmentally, and economically appropriate for use by smallholder farmers with the flexibility to accommodate different power sources. These technologies will contribute to enhanced labor productivity and increased land productivity, thus sustainably reducing poverty among smallholders. The overall objective ofthis project is to intensify smallholder farmers&#39; cropping systems and on-farm operations through mechanization in a sustainable manner. Sustainable intensification will integrate social,economic and environmental impacts with a specific focus on easing the burden on women. The ASMC includes members with substantial institutional capacity and expertise, and active collaborations with institutions and entry point organizations in four designated countries in South Asia, East Africa and West Africa: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso.The ASMC will utilize a three-tier approach that accounts for the required farming tasks, associated mechanization priorities and an operational strategy for achieving appropriate and scalable mechanization for crop and livestock production on smallholder farms. The operational strategy includes the following six key functions: 1) engage entry point organizations to establish Innovation Hubs, 2) assess country specific mechanization challenges, opportunities, and priorities, 3) implement country specific activities utilizing participatory research methods, 4) build human capacity with gender emphasis, 5) monitor and evaluate impact of activities, and 6) share knowledge with in-country stakeholders.To address the barriers to adoption, the ASMC will facilitate the creation of unique Appropriate- Scale Mechanization Innovation Hubs in each country that will identify specific needs, leverage ASMC resources to attract additional support and funding, and implement innovative solutionsto address current challenges and opportunities for mechanization. Innovation Hubs will create an ecosystem of innovation by engaging various stakeholders including smallholder farmers, faculty, students, and business professionals in identifying needs, seeking solutions and resources, promoting/adopting/scaling technology and business development. To ensuresustained and long-term impacts, the Innovation Hubs will focus on capacity building efforts that span mechanization-specific training/educational programs and curricula development to extension activities targeting smallholder farmers and especially women farmers.The work in South Asia will focus on rice and vegetable value chains and the development of technologies and tools that can be used especially by women to sustainably intensify land preparation and water management, transplanting, cultivation and weeding, crop harvesting, handling and on-farm processing. The work in Ethiopia and Burkina Faso will develop and refine sustainable mechanization practices with draft animals and small 2-WD tractors with an emphasis on zone tillage, seeding, weeding, and shelling technologies for maize that will be readily transferrable to other cropping systems, such as sorghum and millet production, as well as for use in other Feed the Future countries such as Tanzania and Senegal where two of SIIL&#39;s regional representatives are located. The scope of activities will include prototype testing and evaluation, train-the-trainer sessions for local extension and technical service providers, on-farm evaluation and artisan training for local manufacturing and marketing of technologies, tools and custom services. Special consideration will be given to designs suitable for up-scaling. Finally, the ASMC intends to make the Innovation Hubs self-sustaining so that they will succeed in facilitating the development, adoption and dissemination of technologies after the end of this project.

1122,"Research described in this proposal addresses BRAG standard program area 5(d)  Research addressing off-target genotypic and/or phenotypic effects in GE organisms developed using genome editing technology. The process of genome editing seeks to make specific changes to DNA that improve crops through the addition or enhancement of agronomically important traits. The CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats with associated Cas9 protein) system accomplishes this well, but has been observed to make changes in non-target areas of genomes (off-target effects) as well. This can complicate research and interfere with trait development. The goal of this work is to improve CRISPR design to reduce off-target effects, thus enabling scientists to make changes only to specific genes and traits of interest. This will be accomplished as follows. In the design of CRISPRs, sequence-based bioinformatics tools are used to identify both target and off-target sites. Currently, bioinformatics predictions of off-target activities, especially for crop species, lack biological validation. This research seeks to generate experimental data that can be used to improve the predictive reliability of plant CRISPR specificity through the improvement of an open-source CRISPR design tool developed by Iowa State University. Improving predictive accuracy and reducing off-target mutation requires iterative, data-driven modifications to the algorithms underlying the functionality of existing CRISPR analysis tools. This will be accomplished by (1) evaluating high-fidelity enzymes for off-target cleavage reduction and (2) validating off-target activity in transgenic events. In addition, information about CRISPR technology and its robustness for targeted editing will be communicated to both research and regulatory communities. This research brings together extensive expertise in bioinformatics, biochemistry, plant genetic transformation, and risk assessment. This project&#39;s interdisciplinary team intends not only to improve the existing CRISPR design tool and system for plant genome editing, but also to generate important data addressing off-target genotypic effects in crop species such as maize and rice.

1123,"The global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050 with food demand to increase by 70% during that time (van Huis, A. et. al, 2015 and Shockley, 2014). Nearly 200 million children worldwide suffer from malnutrition with the World Health Organization estimating that 54% of child mortality is the result of malnutrition (Shockley, 2014). With land and water use already stressed with food production (70% of all agricultural land and 30% of total land is used to raise livestock), along with the measured effect of animal production on greenhouse gas emissions and ammonia waste, another viable, sustainable, and scalable source of nutrient rich food must be explored to meet the rising food demand and address the current global rates of malnutrition (Shockley, 2014). Bugeater Labs wants to introduce a protein source that is more sustainable than today&#39;s top national protein sources with insect protein. While utilizing insects for food is not a new concept, one of the main challenges to brodar use of insects as a major human food source throughout the world, especially in the United States and Europe, is meeting the challenge of  how to turn insects into safe, healthy, and tasty food products. (Shockley, 2014).  Creating widespread acceptance, innovation in products, and ensuring high value nutrients, are essential to meeting the growing food demand over the next 35 years. The main methods for this project will be trial and error. Bugeater Labs will be running extrusion trials (production trials) of insect rice and pasta with insect. Each product created will be tasted, cooked, and have nutritional analysis ran on them to find the best overall product for consumers. Once 2-3 options are decided a sensory evaluation will be done to see any consumer suggestions and to find the best product. We will conduct economic feasibility research through out the process to asure this product is cost effective for both the company and consumers. In the end it is expected to have created a product that is acceptable for most consumers and have increased nutrition content over non-insect fortified competitors. Bugeater Labs&#39; goal is to increase consumption of insect-based products in an effort to meet the growing population&#39;s food demands on limited resources while growing the insect industry to drive down costs and speed adoption. The innovation in our project is creating insect products that mimic traditional staple foods and provide high-value nutrients for widespread adoption in the market. By incorporating insects into traditional staple foods, we believe will see acceptance grow faster and allow for the development of more insect based food products. This will create a new protein source that can address some food security issues and lessen the environmental impact of other sources.

1124,"This project is focused on the development and demonstration of technology to reduce nitrogen fertilizer usage while maintaining yields and increasing resistance to environmental stress. The technology is suitable for areas of intensive agricultural crop production as well as the production of biomass crops on marginal lands for sustainable biofuel and bioenergy production. The development and demonstration of nitrogen fixing endophytic bacteria suited for corn and important agricultural crops provides a means to improve yields while decreasing environmental impacts of soil applied nitrogen fertilizers such as generation of greenhouse gases and negative impacts to surface waters.The interior of many plant species provides habitat for a wide range of bacteria and fungi that benefit the plant host by increasing nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance. The term  endophyte  was coined to describe these internal microbes that spend a significant part of their life cycle within plants and do not cause disease. A subset of these endophytic microorganisms fixes atmospheric nitrogen into the usable forms of ammonia and nitrate within the plant. Such microbes are termed diazotrophs, and have been found in major food crops including rice, maize, sugar cane, and sweet potato. Although diazotrophic endophytes can promote growth by producing phytohormones, it has been demonstrated that significant amounts of fixed nitrogen can be provided by them as well to improve plant growth.Successful completion of this project will demonstrate specific benefits of nitrogen fixing endophytes in larger scale greenhouse and small plot field studies and form the basis for large scale field demonstrations and production in Phase II including manufacture, delivery and application methods compatible with current agriculture production techniques.

1125,"The principal objective of the proposed USDA SBIR Phase I project is to develop the use of Nanophase Silica (NS), a product derived from processing of agricultural waste, as a key ingredient in Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) formulations to achieve very high strength, durability and dimensional stability (i.e. no shrinkage or expansion without cracking). Also, the excess energy/steam from heating of rice hulls will be calculated for in-house, residential and industry usage. At present, silica fume is being used as the primary ingredient to serve as a high reactivitypozzolan in UHPC formulations. Nanophase Silica due to its chemical and mineralogical composition and its unique cellular physical structures offers both the pozzolanic reactivity and a potential to serve as an internal curing agent that reduces shrinkage and cracking in UHPC. Silica fume, in contrast can only serve as a high reactivity pozzolan and due to high specific surface area and water demand tends to increase the shrinkage and the associated potential to cracking.After successful completion of Phase I, we will file US and global patents. We have a good team that consists of soil chemist, chemical engineer, civil engineer/cement chemistand Board of Advisors that can bring the technology to USA and global markets. This will generate revenue for USA rice millsand ultimatelyfor rice growing farmers.

Maghirang and K. Zhu of Kansas State University, also in Manhattan; Dr. B. Adam of Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK; and several industrial collaborators. Our proposed research addresses three questions outlined in the RFA: 1) examining non-fumigant options, 2) systems-based approaches to improve pest management in post-harvest environments impacted by the loss of methyl bromide, and (3) improving aerosols as a pest management alternative. Our proposed research focuses on improving the distribution and efficacy of aerosol insecticides for control of stored-product insects in food storage and processing facilities. The broad objectives include analysis of aerosol droplet size in relation to residual efficacy of the combination of pyrethrins and insect growth regulators, impact of sanitation on aerosol residual efficacy, evaluation of aerosol droplet distribution and deposition and their relation to control efficacy, and development of computational fluid dynamic models of aerosol treatments. This information will be used to develop more effective aerosol application techniques. Economic evaluations will be conducted to determine the costs and benefits of new techniques. Technology transfer will be accomplished through oral and written presentations to user groups, a training sessions conducted at Kansas State University and at a special session conducted at an annual Methyl Bromide Alternatives Outreach conference.

1127,"The rate of yield gain in breeding programs lags behind the demand for crop production forcing the community of breeders and geneticists to investigate innovative strategies to break this negative trend. Genetic mapping studies in crops, fueled by the availability of whole genome sequences, identified a number of genes controlling major agronomic traits including yield components. The release of the annotated genome sequence and the development of functional genomics tools for wheat now provides the opportunity to easily extrapolate gene mapping information from other crops to wheat.CRISPR/CAS9-based genome editing has emerged as a disruptive technology that can take full advantage of the available genomic information and help to rapidly validate gene candidates identified by the inter-species comparative analyses, or help to transfer traits among wheat cultivars. The technology relies on the ability of short sequence called guiding RNA (gRNA) to guide enzyme CAS9 capable of cutting DNA to a precise location in the genome. The CAS9/gRNA complex then acts as a pair of scissors to cut DNA and introduce changes into the genetic code of specific genes. Our project will explore the capabilities of this novel CAS9-based gene editing technology to unlock the potential of the complex wheat genome, thereby building a foundation for transformative approaches to wheat improvement that can be deployed in both the public and private sectors.We have identified 18 genes that in rice or maize that have a potential to affect yield component traits in wheat. We will use CAS9-based editing technology to modify these genes in wheat cultivars and then assess whether the introduced changes in genes result in positive changes in the yield component traits. This will allow us not only to create wheat lines with the improved yield components but also to optimize the CAS9-based technology for manipulating the wheat genome. This knowledge will be critical for devising future gene editing strategies to improve other agronomic traits in wheat. For the newly developed variants of genes affecting yield components we will initiate the transfer into the adapted cultivars grown in Kansas and Oklahoma. These efforts will help us to assess the value of gene editing for wheat improvement and establish a pipeline for deploying this technology in wheat breeding programs.The project will train a new generation of breeders and geneticists in genome editing technology and the regulatory aspects of crop biotechnology thereby contributing to fulfilling the needs of industry, stakeholders, and academia in a trained workforce and making wheat production more profitable. By pursuing these objectives, the project will address one of the key aims of the NIFA-IWYP to increase the genetic component of wheat yield and achieve sustainable intensification of agricultural production. The project is closely integrated with the Wheat CAP and is a part of overarching International Wheat Yield Partnership program aimed at increasing the genetic yield potential of wheat using innovative approaches.

1128,"More than 700 million tons of wheat are produced each year, providing more than one fifth of the calories and protein consumed by the human population. Current rates of improvement for wheat grain yield are not sufficient to feed a rapidly growing human population. Further increases in global wheat production will benefit from the identification and characterization of genes controlling wheat yield. The identification of these genes is a necessary first step to understand how these genes work, how they interact with each other and with the environment and how to combine them to accelerate the rates of wheat improvement for grain yield.In our previous Collaborative Agricultural Project (Triticeae CAP), we identified several wheat chromosome regions that have a positive effect on grain yield. However, the genes responsible for these beneficial effects remain unknown. The tools required for the identification and validation of these genes have been recently developed for wheat, including the first genome sequence and the development of sequenced mutant populations for gene validation. The application of these new tools to the well-characterized genetic populations developed in our previous project provides a unique opportunity to identify the genes controlling grain yield. Today, wheat is in a situation similar to that of rice after the release of its genome sequence in 2005, which resulted in an exponential increase in the number of identified genes in rice. In this project we propose to use these new tools to identify 15 genes controlling grain size, grain number, reproductive tiller number and overall grain yield. The chromosome regions controlling these traits have been identified in our previous grant. In this project, we will develop very large mapping populations segregating only for the chromosome region of interest and will use this genetic information to define precisely the candidate gene region. We will then use the recently released wheat genome sequence to identify all the genes present in the targeted region and to identify candidate genes. These candidate genes will be validated using available sequenced mutant populations and transgenic approaches including genome editing.These beneficial gene variants will be incorporated into elite breeding wheat lines to test their effect on grain yield in different environments. Lines differing only in the selected genes will be developed to test precisely the effect of the targeted genes. In addition, we will test the effect of different gene combinations on overall grain yield.A long-term constraint to future increases in wheat production in the USA is the limited number of trained plant breeders. In this project we will train the next generation of plant breeders, providing direct experience in field-based research, experimental design and bioinformatics tools. Our group has access to active breeding programs supported by the Universities, which will provide a perfect environment to train students in plant breeding. In addition, we will provide students online conferences and courses, face-to-face workshops, student seminars, and student discussion workshops. Each student will lead one gene identification and one gene deployment program. Students will see firsthand the challenges and rewards of transferring value from research to commercial varieties. Finally, the interaction with CIMMYT will provide students a global vision of plant breeding. The simultaneous training of a cohort of 15 PhD students will enhance the opportunities for collaboration and teach students the value of team work to solve complex problems. Results from this project will be disseminated in two ways. First, by releasing germplasm and varieties with alleles for increased yield. Growers will be able to see in their fields the benefits of this research. Isogenic lines carrying the selected alleles will be also showcased in field days and demonstration trials to show growers and industry concrete examples of the value generated by this research project. Results from comparative yield trials will be presented in local grower meetings, wheat commissions, and local agronomic journals to directly reach the growers. Second, results will be presented in publications in peer reviewed scientific journals and in national and international scientific conferences. Students will be encouraged to disseminate their work in posters, conferences and field day presentationsThe ultimate goal of this project is to accelerate the rate of wheat improvement for grain yield without jeopardizing its quality and nutritional value.

1129,"Wheat is a globally important grain at the forefront of food security issues. However, like rice, maize, and sorghum, it is achieving barely 50% of the annual yield progress rate necessary to meet food needs widely forecast for 2050. For over ten years an approach melding ecophysiological and quantitative genetic modeling has been evolving the potential to accelerate breeding rates of gain. This entails a two-step process that first fits crop models to data and then association maps the resulting parameter values to genetic markers. However, technological limits impede collection of the large amounts of needed plant trait data, especially the geometry of dense plant canopies.Targeting Kansas wheat breeding trials, this project is a proof-of-concept test combining microwave radar sensing with a novel, inversion algorithm to ameliorate the situation. The basic rationale is that (1) it is unnecessary to sense the 3D position, angle, and size of every tiller and leaf in a trial plot - rather one desires the genetic markers and effect sizes associated with these quantities&#39; statistical distributions; (2) models interrelating markers and morphology exist; (3) if radar calculations for plant canopies can be accelerated, then the models in (2) can be inverted to yield genetics in a single-step; and (4) an extension of the Analytical Element Method (AEM) from hydrology to electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation can provide such a speed up.Briefly, the AEM exactly solves the field equations for very simple shapes that are then combined to yield machine accurate-answers for complex geometries. Unlike solvers in common use, the AEM only calculates solutions at the specific points of interest, thus hugely reducing computational loads. Prior work has found AEM sollutions for EM waves in two dimensions. This project will extend those solutions to full 3D.Concurrently, an existing wheat model that predicts highly realistic plant shapes will be modified so its outputs are expressed in terms of the AEM basic shapes. A three-layer model will then be built comprising [genetic markers : plant shapes : EM fields] and solved by probablistic methods. This will yield the genetic markers most associated with the plant shapes sensed by radar. The method will be tested by team members with radar expertise using the facilities of the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets. Experiments in a large anechoic chamber will compare AEM predictions to actual radar reflectance data for simplified targets. The EM properties of wheat at radar frequencies will also be measured in the chamber using small, movable plots.Based on these data, a prototype field system will be constructed and used to gather plot data in a field trial conducted as part of the on-going Kansas wheat breeding program. Two tests will be performed. First the radar data will be association mapped directly to detect any responses to genetically determined canopy features. If positive results are found, they will be compared to published phenotypic mapping studies and hypotheses developed as to features to which the radar might be responding. The second test will solve the three layer model described above and also compare the results to literature.

1130,"Maize is one of the most important food, feed, and energy crops in the United States. Traditional breeding increased crop yields by manipulating components of plant architecture including height, branching, and floral organ development. Since the inception of hybrid maize breeding in 1908, yield gains driven by increasing leaf angle allowed higher planting densities and achieved higher nitrogen utilization from nitrogen fertilizer application. In many cereals, such as rice and wheat, the  Green Revolution  utilized dwarf varieties deficient in gibberellin (GA) synthesis or signaling to increase the harvest index. This approach has not yet been successful in maize and I have demonstrated that we lack fundamental understanding of how GA interacts with other determinants of maize plant growth. My research seeks to understand the mutual interdependence of three plant hormones that control maize plant architecture: brassinosteroids (BRs), strigolactones (SLs), and GA. BRs interact with both GA and SLs to regulate plant architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, BR, GA, and SL interactions are unknown in maize. I will profile the expression of maize genes, by RNA-Seq experiments, which will describe transcriptional overlap of these plant hormones and their interactions. GA and BR deficient mutants will be analyzed for differential transcript abundance to comprehensively describe response of every gene in the genome to the absence of these growth regulators. Treatments of a BR deficient mutant with SL, GA, and a GA inhibitor will be analyzed for effects on plant height and branching. All of the genes that change in their expression in response to these hormones will also be identified. This will provide a list of the genes that can control plant development in response to these growth regulators. To further elucidate BR regulation, I will mutagenize BR-deficient mutants to identify genes that can enhance and suppress the dwarfism, altered branching, and abnormal flowers in BR-deficient plants. I will further my computational biology skills by developing a next-generation sequencing approach to identify the mutations responsible for modification of BR phenotypes. Knowledge of the hormonal influences, interactions, and the molecular identities of the genes responsible for maize architecture will permit targeted improvement to increase yields and feed our ever-growing population.

1131,"The architecture of a plant root system determines its access to resources including water and nutrients. Therefore, manipulation of root system architecture can optimize resource capture. This is important particularly for drought-prone areas, soils with limited nutrition, and changing climatic zones. Many factors shape root system architecture by controlling the number, length, and angle of roots. Thus far, only one gene, DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1), has been identified to control root angle in rice crops. This project aims to understand the roles of three DRO1-like genes in determining root system architecture of tree fruit crops and Arabidopsis. In rice, DRO1 expression in rice was shown to correlate with deeper rooting and increased drought avoidance. Our preliminary data show that DRO1 overexpression also leads to deeper rooting in plum, and mutating DRO1 or DRO2 results in horizontal root branching in Arabidopsis. Through this research, we will assess the functions of DRO genes in Arabidopsis and fruit trees and their potential use in drought avoidance in plum and apple. This project will both reveal DRO functions in Arabidopsis and fruit trees, and determine whether we can alter root system architecture using DRO genes to optimize rootstocks for different soil types (i.e. low vs. high water holding capacity). This optimization will allow for better water access in these long-lived tree crop species, which is crucial as our climate changes.

1132,"Plant diseases caused by bacteria limit crop production globally. Some bacteria stay localized and cause localized leaf lesions or spots. Others move in the plant vascular system to produce long distance symptoms along the veins leading to wilt or whole leaf desiccation. Why do some bacteria stay local while other move throughout the plant? This research tackles this basic question to understand the evolutionary and biological basis for long-distance and local symptom development. This postdoctoral fellowship will train an early career academic scientist to tackle research questions important to American and global wheat, barley and rice production. This project will use basic plant microbiology techniques and microscopy to monitor bacterial movement. We will also use Next Generation technologies such as gene expression profiling to monitor both the pathogen and plant behavior during local and long-distance infection.

1133,"Foodborne illness is an important public health issue in the United States. Data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#39;s (CDC) reveal a total of 19,056 cases of culture-confirmed bacterial and laboratory-confirmed parasitic infection, 4,200 hospitalizations, and 80 deaths among 48 million residents of 10 states, 15% of the US population. Some groups such as pregnant women are at higher risk for foodborne illness than others. Pregnant women have a greater risk for foodborne illness, due to down-regulation of the cellular immune system induced by hormonal changes. A growing body of research on low-income pregnant women as a whole, however, very little records on minority ethnic and cultural factors.Each minority group has their unique food culture, thus, they encounter some different barriers to food safety recommendations. First, different ethnicity tends to have their own selection of dishes that require precautions and special preparation methods to enhance food safety: the Latin Americans that have raw seafood in their Ceviche, the Vietnamese that have raw meat in pho, and the Japanese, whose sushi chefs need to frequently change the water bowls that they use to keep their hands wet during sushi preparation. It has also been reported that Asian and Mexican families were particularly more willing to purchase live poultry, which has not yet been studied in a food safety perspective, but could put them at greater risk of cross-contamination. Secondly, some ethnic foods have been reported being related to foodborne illness outbreaks. Hispanic pregnant women tended to have a higher incidence of Listeriosis, which was associated with their consumption of Mexican-style fresh cheese. Similarly, high incidence of Yersinia among African American was related to the seasonal production of chitterlings. Fifty percent of outbreaks between 1990 and 2000 associated with Asian foods were due to B. cereus, which is reported to be transmitted from rice, a common ingredient in Asian dishes. This may be related to different perception of food safety in different cultures. It is reported that Asian scored significantly lower on food safety awareness, self-assessment. This project will utilize an integrated approach to address food safety, and develop educational programs based on positive deviance theory. The positive deviance food safety curriculum, a novel educational intervention, allows participants to discuss their food handling behaviors under the direction of a trained moderator and decide to try recommended practices modeled by peers like themselves The project will focus on understanding of the attitudes and behaviors of safe food handling and safe food choice among low-income minority pregnant women (African American, Hispanic and Asian), and evaluating and implementing culturally tailored strategies to overcome barriers to food safety practices. The following objectives will be met: 1) assess attitudes, awareness, and behaviors of food handling and food choice among low-income African American, Hispanic and Asian pregnant women; 2) Modify education program to address each ethnic group&#39;s unique food culture, and evaluate the effectiveness of culturally tailored Positive Deviance food safety curricula among low-income African American, Hispanic and Asian pregnant women; 3) Collaborate with local WIC program, Cooperative Extension Educators, and Health Professionals to promote the curricula among low-income minority pregnant women. This mixed-methods study partners with local health education organizations and uses focus groups, interviews, and intercepts surveys to provide insight applicable to other food safety education areas. The ultimate goal is to enhance safe food handling and safe food choice among low-income minority pregnant women, and will shed lights in an understanding of low-income family&#39;s unique barriers to safe food handling and food culture.

1134,"Agriculture faces the most significant challenges in the history of humanity, including feeding a growing population and meeting energy demands while preserving delicate soil and water resources in the face of a changing climate. Perennial crop species are central to the overall sustainable intensification of cropping systems for food, feed, fiber, and fuel. Dual-use crops that can serve as a biofuel feedstock in addition to a source of edible grain add additional economic potential to the cropping systems that are needed to meet projected demand for both food and fuel. Historical efforts to create perennial grain species with both vigorous perennial regrowth and high grain yield has remained challenging, leading to efforts to instead domesticate perennial species to improve traits like increased seed size, non-shattering, and free threshing. Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG), or Thinopyrum intermedium, is a strong perennial species with prolific biomass production, relatively large seeds and high grain yield that has been targeted for domestication as a dual-use perennial grain and biomass crop. IWG and related Thinopyrum species have long served as an important gene reservoir for wheat breeding, including attempts to develop perennial wheat through hybridization with a relative of IWG, Thinopyrum elongatum. As a perennial crop, IWG can provide essential ecosystem services to current agricultural practices such as stabilizing soil with its deep (&gt;3 meters) root structure, reducing nutrient runoff, and limiting weed growth. For biofuels, IWG produces biomass quantities similar or greater than switchgrass, with the added potential of &gt;1,000 kg/ha of grain that is comparable to wheat in food products.Significant efforts to improve IWG through traditional breeding have focused on traits such as plant height, biomass production, seed size, free threshing ability, and early maturity. While some progress has been made, accelerating the improvement of IWG is likely possible using modern genomics-based breeding tools. There are limited molecular breeding and genomic tools for IWG due to its large, highly repetitive genome. Ongoing efforts to develop genomic tools for IWG and the high quality reference genomes for species across the Triticeae provide a novel platform for exploring the genomic landscape of plant perenniality using comparative genomic and systems approaches. Currently, there is only a nascent understanding of the complex genetics of perenniality across the plant kingdom, which has limited the development of vigorous perennial crops that produce consistent yields year to year and limited the perennialization of annual crop species.An improved understanding of the genomic landscape of the annual vs. perennial growth habit could enable the development of other robust perennial crop species, like IWG, suitable for wide scale production. An enhanced understanding of the complex suite of genes underlying perenniality will enable the improvement of current perennial biomass and grain crops, along with providing vital resources to address the long-standing goal of &#39;perennializing&#39; annual crops like rice, wheat, and sorghum. Additionally, unraveling the genome evolution within the Thinopyrum genus will improve our basic knowledge regarding the sources of novel traits introgressed from Thinopyrum species into wheat.

1135,"Seeds are the foundation of agricultural systems that feed humanity. In fact, seeds of wheat, maize and rice account for 70% of global food calories. Likewise, seeds are increasingly important in habitat restoration, production of aesthetic and non-food products, and to fulfill fiber and fuel needs. Seeds also represent the main laboratory-to-field delivery system for technologies addressing significant agricultural problems such as enhanced crop performance under stressful conditions, disease and insect control, and weed management. Therefore, seeds play numerous, indispensable roles in agricultural systems confronted with current and future challenges related to food security, energy needs, natural resources protection and sustainable agricultural intensification in the face of climate change. Communicating new advances in seed biology research ensures robust agricultural systems primed to confront these problems. However, expansion of new seed-based solutions that enhance U.S. agriculture are at risk due to decreases in research programs and educational opportunities within seed science. Thus, objectives of the 12th International Seed Conference are to: 1) enable exchange of new scientific information that can stimulate innovation needed to generate novel solutions and 2) improve educational experiences and career prospects of future seed scientists. The objectives will be achieved by inviting leading global seed scientists to discuss how seeds function as or within biological systems. Moreover, post-doctoral and graduate researchers will actively particpate in the program by co-hosting oral session, delivering invited presentations and introducing posters via 1-minute talks.

1136,"Arsenic accumulation in rice poses a serious threat to agriculture and human health in the U.S. and worldwide. Rice is a staple crop that feeds billions and is frequently grown on arsenic-contaminated lands, which reduces crop yields and exposes consumers to the toxic effects of arsenic through consumption of arsenic-laden rice grain. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop rice varieties that limit arsenic accumulation. The goal of this project is to identify the genetic factors that control arsenic accumulation in rice grain and arsenic tolerance of rice plants. To uncover these factors, we will (1) generate segregating populations from crosses between rice cultivars known for grain-arsenic accumulation and exclusion, (2) identify and use molecular markers to discover genetic factors linked to arsenic-related traits, and (3) test the impact of manipulating the expression of these factors on arsenic accumulation and tolerance. Our results will facilitate breeding of rice cultivars with increased yields and decreased concentration of arsenic in the grains. This will not only result in enhanced rice productivity, directly benefiting U.S. and global agriculture, but will also decrease consumption of arsenic-contaminated rice, which is increasingly recognized as a global health concern. The proposed project addresses the FY 2016 program area priority, Physiology of Agricultural Plants, in several ways, as it employs molecular and whole-plant approaches to 1) understand how plant growth affects productivity, 2) improve grain nutritional quality, and 3) understand mechanisms of plant responses to abiotic stress.

1137,"This project will evaluate the potential to improve the drought tolerance of corn by selecting plants with smaller but more numerous xylem vessels, which are the cellular structures in roots that carry water from the soil to the leaves. Corn is the most important crop in the USA and globally. Drought stress is the most important limitation for corn production in the USA and globally, and drought stress is expected to become more severe in coming decades as a result of global climate change. We have observed that corn lines with a large number of small vessels perform better under drought. In this project we will confirm and extend these results, and also identify genes that are responsible for this natural variation.Defining and understanding traits improving the drought tolerance of crops is needed to breed crop varieties with better yield, better drought tolerance, and less reliance on irrigation. Insufficient information exists regarding the value of xylem vessels in crop breeding. Should the importance of xylem vessels for drought tolerance be demonstrated, an entirely new tool will be available for targeted crop improvement. This project will provide validated breeding targets, germplasm sources, molecular markers, and candidate genes that could be used directly in maize breeding. Our close collaboration with maize geneticists will ensure that any useful results will be readily applied in the maize community. While this project focuses on maize, xylem vessels may also be useful breeding targets in wheat, rice, legumes, and other crops. This project therefore addresses novel scientific issues that are of demonstrable relevance to human welfare.

1138,"Rice is life--a staple food for more than half of humanity. Globally, rice production must increase in accordance with the population growth of developing nations to ensure food security for nine billion people by 2050 in the face of increasing extreme weather events, including heavy precipitation. Flooding is a frequent natural disaster, in 2015 alone, crop damage from floods amounted to over $471 million in the U.S. While the loss in rice production due to flash flooding alone exceeds $1 billion each year in Asia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between weather variables, including rainfall and repeated floods, and poor child health and development due to malnutrition at the household level. Deploying high-yielding submergence tolerant rice is one of the best measures to mitigate flooding impacts. The prior identification of Sub1 (SUB1A), a single gene that improves the tolerance of rice to submergence has benefited millions of farmers. Sub1 confers tolerance to submergence via a quiescence strategy, where the plant limits growth under submergence to conserve energy which helps the plant regrow after de-submergence. Varieties bred to possess Sub1 now provide significant yield preservation in farmers&#39; fields when flooding occurs during the vegetative stage. However, areas with repeated, severe and prolonged flooding require varieties that have higher levels of submergence tolerance. This project seeks new tolerance genes that are complementary to SUB1 to further increase yields in flood-prone areas. A second major quantitative trait locus that has the potential to enhance submergence tolerance, qSUB8.1, has been identified from a genetic mapping population that already posseses SUB1. We propose to identify the key gene(s) of qSUB8.1 and investigate how its works to provide submergence tolerance in conjunction with SUB1A. The major outcome will be knowledge of functional gene(s) that improve the survival of rice of a serious flood. This will aid improvement of flooding survival strategies to flood-sensitive crops including maize and soybean.

1139,"Soil salinity significantly affects productivity of almost all crops including rice, thus salt tolerance is an important target trait for rice breeding programs. Metabolomic profiles represent a functional readout of cellular biochemistry, thus more closely correlating with the phenotype than the transcriptomics or proteomics, thus can offer critical insights into biological mechanisms of salt tolerance. Our preliminary results indicated an important role for serotonin in salt tolerance of rice, which raised the hypothesis that serotonin accumulation correlates with tolerance to diverse abiotic stresses in rice. By determining serotonin levels and related gene expression profiles, this proposal will determine the extent to which tolerance to diverse abiotic stresses in rice is correlated with increased serotonin accumulation.

1141,"﻿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of adverse events such as surgical site infections and surgical errors are a huge problem in the operating room (OR) due to the high vulnerability of the patient and the complex interactions required between providers of different disciplines and a range of equipment, technology and the physical space where care is provided.  Two to five percent of all patients who undergo an operation will develop a surgical site infection leading to significant mortality and morbidity.  Distractions and interruptions are major causes of medical errors during surgery and often lead to serious patient harm.  While significant efforts to improve patient safety have been focused on enhancing skills and training for surgical staff, little effort has been directed at the environment in which healthcare provider work.      The overreaching goal of the proposed 'Realizing Improved Patient Care through Human-Centered Design in the OR' (RIPCHD.OR) learning lab is to develop an evidence-based framework and methodology for the design and operation of a general surgical operating room to improve safety.  RIPCHD.OR will use a multidisciplinary human-centered approach incorporating evidence based design, human factors and systems engineering principles.      Clemson University will collaborate with the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the Health Sciences South Carolina (HSSC) to develop the RIPCHD.OR learning lab.  The design, process and technology solutions that emerge from this learning lab will be implemented and tested in the new MUSC Ambulatory Surgery Center in Charleston, SC.      Three highly interrelated and integrated patient safety focused projects related to key aspects of OR suite design will be undertaken over the course of four years:      Project 1: Unmasking of anesthesia related alarms and communications   Project 2: Understanding traffic flows and door openings in the OR   Project 3: Integrated OR suite design Achievement; Acute Brain Injuries; Animal Behavior; Animal Model; Animal Testing; Animals; Area; Attention; Behavior; behavior test; Behavioral; Birth; Blinking; Brain; Brain Hypoxia-Ischemia; Brain Injuries; Brain region; Caregivers; Cell Respiration; Cerebellum; Clinical; clinical practice; clinically relevant; Cognitive; Cognitive deficits; Common Core; conditioning; Development; Developmental Process; Diffuse; Elements; emotional behavior; Event; Exhibits; experimental study; Female; Foundations; Future; Gene Expression; Goals; Health; Hippocampus (Brain); Histologic; Histology; Human; Image; Impairment; Infant; Inflammation; Injury; Innate Immune System; insight; interdisciplinary approach; Knowledge; Laboratory Rat; Learning; Life; Lipids; Literature; Live Birth; male; Membrane Microdomains; Metabolic; Metabolism; Microglia; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Motor; natural hypothermia; Natural regeneration; neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury; neonate; neurodevelopment; neuroinflammation; Neurologic; Neurotransmitters; new therapeutic target; Newborn Infant; Nodal; novel; Oxidative Stress; Pathologic; Perinatal; Perinatal Hypoxia; Pilot Projects; postnatal; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; Prefrontal Cortex; premature; prevent; Prevention; Preventive Intervention; programs; Rattus; Recovery; Resolution; response; response to injury; Rice; Risk; Rodent; Role; Running; Series; sex; Sex Characteristics; Signal Transduction; social; Source; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Standardization; synergism; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Transference; translational study; Translations; Trees; Variant; WorkREALIZING IMPROVED PATIENT CARE THROUGH HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN IN THE OR",0.999999,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06
1142,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTShared decision making (SDM) has the potential to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities. Toengage in SDM, patients must have both (1) knowledge of the treatment options, and (2) power – the self-perceived need and capacity – to influence decision making. SDM interventions, e.g. decision aids, increaseknowledge. However, barriers to patient empowerment hinder engagement, including patients’ perceptionsthat their personal input is not valued and doctor-patient power imbalances. Importantly, socioeconomicallydisadvantaged patients disproportionately experience these barriers. Understanding how decision aidsaddress barriers to disadvantaged patients’ engagement in decision making and identifying persistent barrierswhich can be targeted by adjunct interventions are critical steps towards reducing health disparities.In this study, we use breast cancer surgery as a model to identify and characterize barriers tosocioeconomically disadvantaged patients’ engagement in SDM. In order for a decision aid to be effective,patients must be able to access and review it; it is therefore critical to consider barriers to access. Yet evenafter successful review of a decision aid, persistent barriers may limit patients’ engagement. The objective ofthis study is to test the effectiveness of a decision aid in increasing patient engagement in SDM and identifybarriers to engagement not mitigated by the decision aid that could be targets for adjunct SDM interventions.We propose a multi-site cluster randomized trial using a stepped wedge design to enroll clinics serving a highproportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients within an established national community cancerresearch network. We will deliver a web-based decision aid via email directly to patients prior to their surgicalconsult. We will use mixed methods to accomplish the following specific aims: Aim 1, test the effectiveness ofa breast cancer surgery decision aid in increasing patient engagement in decision making (measured by powerand knowledge) in clinics serving a high proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients; Aim 2, testthe extent to which the effect of a decision aid on patient engagement is mediated through the mitigation ofbarriers, and determine if persistent barriers are disproportionately experienced by socioeconomicallydisadvantaged patients; and Aim 3, characterize how persistent barriers influence patient engagement indecision making in order to identify targets for adjunct interventions that could implemented in clinics serving ahigh proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients.By understanding barriers to engagement in SDM that persist despite receipt of a decision aid, we will identifytargets for adjunct interventions. Combining the routine pre-consultation delivery of a decision aid with thetailored delivery of adjunct interventions addressing persistent barriers to engagement is a sustainable modelof SDM that maximizes clinics’ finite resources. If proven effective, this approach will have far-reachingimplications across a variety of healthcare decisions.

1143,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Center for Health Systems Research at an integrated safety net health system, predicated on the view that the safety net can provide lessons about efficiency that the entire healthcare system can learn from. The Center's theme will be system design for the disadvantaged in the context of the resource constraints that are unique to the safety net, thus emphasizing both reduction of health disparities in the underserved and comparison of delivery system designs. We will partner with an academic research unit and an applied healthcare research organization to develop a research infrastructure and to create collaborations that will sustain meaningful patient-centered outcomes research well into the future. Infrastructure development includes building the methodological skills of our emerging investigators through a highly structured teaching and mentorship program, and development of a cross-institution data integration structure that will begin to connect us with much larger research networks. We will demonstrate functionality of the data integration structure with a description of the geography of depression in Denver.

1144,"PROJECT SUMMARY:In its recently released report,  Improving Diagnosis in Health Care , the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlightedthat most individuals will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, sometimes with devastatingconsequences. Compared to other healthcare settings, clinicians working in emergency departments (EDs) areparticularly vulnerable to making diagnostic errors due to time-pressured decision-making in a busy and oftenchaotic environment. In addition to this, provision of emergency care to children is complicated by their uniqueneeds such as weight-based dosing of medications, their inability to verbalize their symptoms and often, theirdependence on parents/guardians even for accessing healthcare. There are approximately 25 million annualpediatric ED visits in the United States. A conservative estimate of 5% prevalence, translates into ~ 1.25million potential annual cases of diagnostic errors in the pediatric ED. To date, there has been no systematicresearch on diagnostic errors in the pediatric emergencies.Diagnostic errors, when defined as the inability to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on availableevidence (i.e. missed opportunities for improving diagnosis or MOIDs), have been investigated in adult,outpatient settings. Members of our research team have used electronic health record based triggers to detectMOIDs and study the factors that cause diagnostic errors.Our long-term goal is to better understand MOIDs in pediatric EDs to ultimately decrease their prevalence. Toaccomplish that, in this project, we will assemble a multidisciplinary panel of experts in diagnostic decisionmaking, pediatric emergency medicine along with patient/family advisory boards to develop a pediatric EDrelevant model to identify triggers and subsequently use them to measure the frequency as well as contributingfactors of diagnostic errors in four pediatric EDs.Our project is significant, innovative, and timely because it will lay the foundation for development of errordetection tools that can be used to provide timely feedback to clinicians, track institutional or clinicianperformance, and measure impact of error mitigation strategies. 3 year old; Address; Adult; Age; Back; Businesses; Child; Cleaved cell; clinical practice; density; design; dosage; Dose; Early Intervention; economic outcome; Economics; Education; effective therapy; Expenditure; experience; Face; Failure; Family; Fathers; Goals; Grant; insight; Language; Language Delays; Language Development; Language Disorders; language impairment; Language Therapy; Laws; Learning; learning outcome; literacy; Literature; Machine Learning; Mental Health; Methods; Minority; Nursery Schools; Occupations; Outcome; Outcome Study; Parents; peer; Population; Preschool Child; Procedures; Publishing; Quality of life; Research; Rice; Schools; Series; skills; Societies; socioeconomics; Special Education; specific language impairment; success; synergism; Testing; theories; Time; Training; treatment effect; Treatment Efficacy; Vocabulary; WorkMISSED OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVING DIAGNOSIS IN PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999
1145,"Project Summary/AbstractThe Laboratory will maintain accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 and enhance the chemicaland microbiological accreditation scopes. The Laboratory’s accreditation currentlyincludes 11 microbiological methods for food testing, 18 chemical methods for foodtesting, and flexible/technology-based accreditation for pesticide residues in food by GCand LC instruments with a variety of detectors. The Laboratory intends to expand itsaccreditation scope by adding heavy metals testing (arsenic and lead in candy, rice, riceproducts; metals in bottled water), additional microanalytical filth analyses, allergentesting, and Staphylococcus enterotoxin testing. The addition of heavy metals and allergentesting will increase the Laboratory’s capacity as these are tests not currently performedat NCDA&CS. The Laboratory and NC Food Program have a strong collaborativerelationship since they are housed within the same Division of the North CarolinaDepartment of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Laboratory and Food Programwill continue to strengthen their partnership by collaborating on the Sample Collection andAnalysis Project included in this cooperative agreement.

1146,"Research is needed to understand both the shorter- and longer-term impacts of Hurricane Harvey's extreme flooding in the Houston region on the mobilization of chemical and microbial contaminants, as well as how long they persist in impacted areas. In this research, the findings are being integrated and compared to the investigators' findings for previous flood studies in order to understand generalizable principles associated with disease propagation post-flood and microbial community structure changes as a result of extreme flooding. The hypothesis of this study is that significant mobilization of both chemical and microbial contaminants will be evident, resulting in contaminated drinking water sources and sediments enriched in fecal indicators and pathogenic microorganisms. The results are being used to inform the design and deployment of the NSF-supported NEWT ERC's emergency-response treatment technologies that target specific contaminants of concern, with a particular focus on serving socioeconomically vulnerable populations. The results of this research help to improve epidemiologic studies that evaluate the human health impacts of contaminants mobilized and deposited by floodwaters. The societal impacts of this research involve providing data on water, soil and sediment quality that permits assessment of potential human health and ecosystem risks that have been enhanced due to the extreme floods caused by Harvey. Furthermore, the results enhance our understanding of the microbial ecology of disease propagation under flood conditions and inform the design of emergency response treatment systems that can be deployed to vulnerable populations impacted by future extreme flooding events. The research project involves both graduate and undergraduate students. All results are being made available to the public through Rice's Kinder Institute Urban Data Platform, a secure data repository of research-ready geocoded data for the Houston metropolitan area that facilitates cross-disciplinary research and community investigations.

1147,"Chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Every 30 seconds one American will be diagnosed with diabetes and another will suffer a coronary event. These diseases are a burden in underserved communities across the US due to higher prevalence and reduced access to care. Overcoming this human and economic burden is a grand challenge. The vision for the NSF-ERC on Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations (PATHS-UP) is to change the paradigm for the health of underserved populations by developing revolutionary, cost-effective technologies and systems at the point-of-care. Led by Gerard Cot? at Texas A&M University in partnership with the University of California at Los Angeles, Rice University, and Florida International University, PATHS-UP brings outstanding expertise to overcome four barriers endemic to POC devices, the need to: be field deployable, have high accuracy, have low complexity, and be affordable. The mission of PATHS-UP is defined by two overarching goals: (1) to engineer transformative, robust, and affordable technologies to improve healthcare access, enhance the quality of service and life, and reduce healthcare costs and (2) to recruit and educate a diverse group of scientists and engineers who will lead the future in developing enabling technologies to improve health in underserved communities.PATHS-UP will develop two transformative engineered systems to monitor key biomarkers (biochemical, biophysical, and behavioral) of chronic disease: a Lab-in-your-Palm (LiyP) and a Lab-on-a-Wrist (LoaW). The LiyP will be enabled by novel amplification biochips based on nano-engineered single-molecule chain reactions combined with innovative handheld computational imaging and modular spectroscopic instruments. The LoaW will be enabled by unique,  bar-code like  biochemical marker implants (grain of rice in size) coupled with a novel wrist-worn spectral imager to visualize the implant through tissue and innovative sensors to monitor biophysical markers (cuffless blood pressure, heart rate). PATHS-UP will also develop innovative algorithms that monitor behavior (diet, medication intake) and predict long-term complications. These enabling technologies are founded on rigorous research in biomaterials, nanoscale systems, sample enrichment, computational imaging, multimodal data integration, and machine learning. Testbeds include one-of-a-kind in vitro phantoms, human subject studies in controlled lab environments, and patients in underserved communities. Developing and integrating these transformational systems into communities requires a multidisciplinary team of engineers, medical doctors, public health experts, industry professionals, and community health leaders. Such broad technical scope and societal outreach go beyond traditional funding sources and require the formation of the PATHS-UP ERC. The team will use participatory design and community engagement to prevent PATHS-UP from merely throwing technologies at these communities, and instead develop technologies that seamlessly integrate into their lives.Underserved communities in every US state have higher prevalence and less access to equitable healthcare services. Thus, many people in these communities go undiagnosed or are diagnosed late, which can lead to serious consequences. To address this challenge, PATHS-UP will develop advanced technologies to prevent, delay the onset, and manage diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This requires both the development of transformational health technologies and systems and a paradigm shift in how these technologies are integrated into communities. Beyond the obvious societal health impact of the Center?s systems, the students, post-docs, and faculty nurtured by the Center?s intellectual community will also be a significant outcome of PATHS-UP.  The team has a passion to promote meaningful, lasting, engagement with K-College students, especially under-represented minorities and K-12 teachers in our partner underserved communities.  PATHS-UP will provide experiential learning and new engineering/public health curriculum for college students, research experiences for K-12 students and their teachers, and opportunities for participatory design with key stakeholders and community engagement, to promote a rich intellectual environment. The team also has a history of entrepreneurship, having spun off biomedical companies with students, and see building the innovation ecosystem as a vital part of PATHS-UP.

The proposed NSF RET Program will enhance and extend the previous successful RET Program.The Rice Office of STEM Engagement (R-STEM) will offer a K-12 RET program in Nanotechnology with a Focus on Teacher Leadership, an enhancement upon the six years of success Rice University has committed in teacher professional development through research internships. R-STEM will connect STEM teachers who serve students in the Greater Houston metropolitan area with expert faculty in nanoengineering research at Rice. With the help of Rice University's research mentorship and facilities, RET will accomplish the following objectives: 1) use nanoengineering research experiences to enhance teacher content knowledge and understanding of STEM research processes, 2) improve the quality of education though the development of engineering design-based learning activities centered on research practices, 3) create a cadre of teacher leaders, and 4) disseminate the RET outcomes broadly by creating a network of teachers who are actively learning about nanoengineering research and engineering design. Teachers will receive inquiry-based lessons, professional development, and pedagogical support along with leadership training as they translate their research experiences into learning experiences for students. The program will serve as a national model and will broadly disseminate the outcomes of RET via symposiums at Rice, national and state-wide meetings, peer-reviewed publications, and online via the TeachEngineering digital library. Teachers will meet weekly during their RET experience to discuss their research, share their lab experiences, develop lesson ideas, as well as plan the dissemination of their research. Rice postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and industry mentors will be constituents supporting the RET teachers in their research. At the conclusion of the research experience, each teacher will create a research poster to present their experience and finding at the Nanotechnology for Teachers Symposium, to their teaching campus, as well as at district and professional conferences. During the academic school year following their research experiences, teachers will share both their research and lesson plans with other teachers in professional development programs. R-STEM professional development courses will support RET teachers to propagate their knowledge effectively to a large number of STEM teachers, creating a cadre of motivated, creative, and diverse teacher leaders in the community. RET interns will also be encouraged and guided by the R-STEM team to publish their nanotechnology lessons through TeachEngineering.org. Throughout the components of the program, assessment is performed by an external evaluator to determine the impact on the 12 teachers that participate each summer and to provide feedback for refining the program.

1149,"Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) refers to a set of changes to the photosynthetic pathway that allows plants to grow more efficiently under conditions of drought, high temperatures, and/or low atmospheric CO2.  It is biochemically similar to another modification, C4 photosynthesis, but requires fewer structural changes to leaf tissue. We know a great deal about the evolutionary history of the C4 syndrome, and this knowledge has informed efforts to genetically engineer this photosynthetic improvement into crops such as rice. We know virtually nothing about CAM evolution- its genetic underpinnings, its relationship to other plant traits, and whether it is equally likely to evolve in all plant lineages. Here the PI proposes to significantly increase our understanding of how CAM evolves, utilizing a comparative approach and focusing on one horticulturally important plant lineage known for drought tolerance, which includes the cacti. The project involves extensive genetic and ecological analyses, and will also develop a new metric to efficiently screen species for low level CAM activity. Because this is a CAREER award, all research goals of the project are tightly interwoven into an innovative education program involving undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers at Brown University, and graduate students from Peru. In addition to the basic scientific understanding that will be gained, this project should yield valuable insight into the use of CAM photosynthesis for engineering more drought-resistant crops. Moreover it will build a foundational bridge of scientific collaboration between the United States and Peru, and contribute significantly to capacity building and scientific training in a developing nation.

Peters (Washington State University)CoPIs: Jean-Michel Ane (University of Wisconsin - Madison), Maren Friesen (Washington State University), Michael Udvardi (The Samuel Roberts Nobel Foundation), Christopher A. Voigt (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Key Collaborators: Giles E. Oldroyd (John Innes Centre, UK) and Phillip S. Poole (John Innes Centre, Oxford University, UK)Nitrogen is an essential element of biological molecules and life on earth.  Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Scarcity of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fiber and fuel.  Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation in a type of bacteria, diazotrophs, that are able to reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules.  Biological nitrogen fixation is promoted by a complex metal containing enzyme called nitrogenase, whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst bacteria.  Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia.  As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, many important food species, including the grasses maize/corn, rice, and wheat cannot establish effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs, making them dependent on nitrogenous fertilizers for high yield. Large-scale use of industrially-produced nitrogen-fertilizer has doubled the influx of nitrogen into the terrestrial biogeochemical nitrogen-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment.   Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive nitrogen-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators from the US and UK to solve the dual nitrogen problems of nitrogen-fertilizer over-use in developed countries and soil nitrogen-paucity in developing countries by developing effective endophytic (bacteria inside the root) and associative (bacteria attached outside the root) nitrogen-fixing symbioses in a model and a crop plant species.  The overarching goal of the project is to develop effective N2-fixing symbioses between the model C4-grass, Setaria viridis, as well as the related crop species, Zea mays, with the endophytic bacterium, Rhizobium sp. IRBG74, as well as the associative bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescenes Pf5.  Successful deployment of biological nitrogen fixation in model or crop grass species will pave the way for a second Green Revolution to increase crop yields for resource-poor farmers and decrease the use and environmental-impact of industrial nitrogen-fertilizers by wealthier farmers. This project will establish a powerful new model system for the study of plant-microbe interactions and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in engineering new associative relationships and interdependencies that have the potential to be universal for all crop plants.  It will test this potential in the important crop, maize.  The integrated US-UK research partnership will provide a unique training opportunity for students and post-doctoral associates with active exchange of personnel between academic laboratories and research foundations in both countries.  Data and materials generated in the study including plasmid constructs and genetically modified bacterial and plant species will be made available via websites maintained in the US and the UK.  To broaden the impact of the work, traditional and non-traditional outreach strategies will be used to help K-12 teachers, students, and the public understand the fundamentals and benefits of interdisciplinary research and the implications of synthetic biology for the next generation of biotechnological solutions in agriculture.

1151,"This RAISE project is jointly funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry, the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics, the Cellular Dynamics and Function and the Molecular Biophysics Clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the Division of Emerging Frontiers, the RAISE Program and the Office of Integrative Activities. This award is funding Professors Peter Wolynes, Margaret Cheung, Michael Diehl and Herbert Levine at Rice University and M. Neal Waxham at University of Texas (UT) Health-Houston to investigate the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. The initiation of learning begins with changes at neuronal synapses that can strengthen (or weaken) the response of the synapse. This process is termed synaptic plasticity. Stimuli that produce learning lead to structural changes of the post-synaptic dendritic spine. The initial events of memory and learning include a temporary rise in calcium concentrations and activation of a protein called calmodulin. The next step is activation of calmodulin-dependent enzyme, kinase II (CaMKII).  At the same time, structural rearrangements occur in the actin cytoskeleton leading to an enlargement of the spine compartment. How these initial events lead to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is largely unknown. This project focuses on the events that lead to the changes in actin cytoskeleton. The research also addresses the question of how these structural changes in the actin cytoskeleton are used to maintain memory. State-of-the-art computational modeling is used to answer these questions. Modeling is applied at molecular and supra-molecular scales. The models examine molecular changes that bridge the time scales between the initial steps and start of synaptic plasticity. The computational modeling goes hand in hand with state-of-the-art structural and functional imaging and biochemical pathway analyses. The research allows graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire specialized training in computer simulations and mathematical modeling of a subcellular system. The students and fellows acquire an understanding of the brain starting from a molecular level.  The team of theoreticians and experimentalists working cooperatively on this problem strengthens the training process. This project is integrated into an outreach program to introduce undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to science by participating in the research.This research project quantitatively characterizes the relevant molecular processes involved in the dynamical  tectonic  reorganization inside a dendritic spine involved in forming memories.  It focuses on the actin cytoskeleton using computer simulations and experimental analyses at both molecular and supra-molecular scales. This study therefore contributes directly to understanding the role of mechanics and structure in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Explicitly, the hypothesis is that the transient effects from calcium influx create, in a CaMKII-dependent manner, changes in the spatial patterning of the actin structure. Such changes may be be stabilized by feedback loops with prion-like proteins. These stabilized structures may be a type of  structural engram  which then serves as long-term reservoir for maintaining enhanced synaptic strength in the postsynaptic neuron. Testing, modifying, and verifying this hypothesis may help point the way towards a more quantitatively-sophisticated approach to the first stages of learning and memory in the brain.

1152,"NONTECHNICAL SummaryThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education that aims to hone a powerful fundamental theory into a practical approach toward a more realistic description of a wide variety of phenomena.  Important parts of our world fluctuate on many scales. Clouds are wispy, fractals are bumpy, and Rice Krispies crackle. (So does the Earth - earthquakes). Materials, like metal alloys and the membranes of biological cells, can fluctuate on many scales, when their compositions are set near special points. Fifty years ago, the explanation for these fluctuations was discovered to be a kind of scale invariance: these systems look nearly the same after they are magnified, for example big and small cloud wisps look similar. This scale invariance was explained by a theory, describing how the laws governing these systems change when the systems are magnified. The wisps of clouds and the milk in puffed rice have rules that become the same upon changing scale. But this elegant theory has not reached its potential, for example in predicting the weather, or in describing how materials like bone, concrete, and sea-shells form and break. Science can explain the whorls within whorls of turbulence, but it needs to mesh the biggest whorls into the engineer's models designing airplane wings, or the meteorologist's seashores and mountains. This project will build on the PI's recently developed methods for solving this theory more completely and systematically. The PI aims to turn this elegant theory of physics into the bones of a practical engineering tool. In particular, far from these special, scale-invariant points there are well-established methods to calculate the properties of materials and alloys. The PI will develop tools to merge these two descriptions into an integrated, powerful tool for describing complex materials and systems. TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education that aims to extend the quantitative validity of the renormalization group and enable it to engage more realistic problems. Understanding critical phenomena and emergent scale invariance is a key to many of our scientific and engineering challenges. The current formulation of the field is split between an admiration of universal scaling laws and dense, inscrutable calculations for exactly solvable systems, for example the 2D Ising model, and systems near special points, for example the Ising model in 1D and 4D. These latter calculations often violate the naive power laws and Widom scaling usually expected. The PI has recently used the mathematics of bifurcation theory to arrange these anomalous universality classes into universality families, characterizing the logarithms, exponentials, and invariant combinations of scaling variables, many for the first time. These new methods are closely associated with known techniques for incorporating analytic and singular corrections to scaling, and the PI will combine the new correct critical-point singularities with corrections to scaling to dramatically extend the realm of quantitative validity. The project will use the 2D nonequilibrium random-field Ising model to illustrate both the new predicted scaling forms and the role of corrections to scaling, generating a quantitative theory predicting avalanche sizes and magnetization curves over an enormous range of disorder, until the size scale becomes as small as that of the lattice structure. The project will also develop tools to extract entire phase diagrams and concomitant materials behavior for experiments on cellular membranes, honing and validating the tools using the complex phase diagram of a multiparameter membrane model for microemulsions and tricritical Ising phenomena.

1153,"This INFEWS project will identify and communicate science-based resource management constraints to sustain food-energy-water systems in the lower Mekong River Basin (MRB). The Mekong is one of the last major rivers to remain undammed for much of its length. The river's strong natural flood pulse is driven by the South Asian Summer Monsoon and controls multiple ecosystem processes critical to livelihoods in the region. Yet, despite the dominant role floodplain ecosystems play in the region, there is little known in the MRB regarding climate, hydrology, ecological processes, resource users and governance.  Annual flooding controls the fluxes of the key nutrients and contaminants that enhance or shrink the growth and productivity of fish and rice. In this way, the flood pulse is directly linked to human well-being. However, the river's enormous discharge could also generate over 40 GW of power. This power is viewed as essential to stimulate the economic development of the region. It seems certain that future hydropower development and climate variability will impact the flood-pulse and the goods and services it provides in the MRB. To fill these knowledge gaps, this project(a partnership between Arizona State University and the University of Washington) will build analytical frameworks, collect critical field data, and construct new tools that advance the progress of science and that are also applicable for scenario analysis and planning as an aid to sustainable development and that will also promote the progress of science. Furthermore, food, energy and water security are core components of stability throughout the developing world, and this project will advance national security by providing science-based guidelines for stabilizing food-energy-water security tradeoffs in rapidly developing and growing regions of the world.The South Mekong Livelihoods Project (SMLP) will provide a quantitative framework for predicting the effects of hydropower development and climate variability on the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and its flood-pulse, freshwater biodiversity, and both yields and nutritional quality of fish and rice, two key aspects of food security. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macro-hydrology model will predict current and future streamflow and thereby serve as the foundation of the quantitative framework. VIC will be parameterized with new remote-sensing analyses predicting evapotranspiration as well as land-cover change from riparian forest to irrigated rice paddy. Climate simulations and future dam development and operations scenarios will be used as a forcing function for VIC, which will then drive a water-resources development model, a hydropower generation model, and a hydrodynamics model of the Tonle Sap Lake in the lower MRB. The project will link aspects of hydrology with food production in the Tonle Sap in two ways: 1) via multivariate autoregressive state-space analyses of new catch per unit effort data to quantify how timing, magnitude, and the decadal-scale sequence of the flood-pulse drives relative fish abundance and ecosystem processes; and 2) via a crop model (CropSyst) linked to VIC that generates rice yields from a physically based land-surface scheme. Dynamics of the flood-pulse are also likely to control food quality, specifically fluxes of key nutrients and harmful contaminants to people in fish and rice through its effect on redox biogeochemistry. The project will establish this relationship for the first time and incorporate both positive (nutritional) and negative (contaminants) effects of fish and rice into a single metric, thereby quantitatively linking the flood-pulse to human well-being. The research team will use metrics of food-system yield and quality to identify best management practices for dam development and operations using multi-objective optimization approaches that analyze tradeoffs between hydropower generation and food yield. Finally, the project will develop one of the first quantitative institutional analyses using a cooperative game-theoretic approaches to unearth best practices in creating international coalitions at multiple scales of governance. These system components will be integrated by measuring robustness of tradeoffs under climate extremes and given bargaining among institutions that might force local solutions to diverge from the global (basin) optima.  The project will: 1) train three US-based postdoctoral researchers, six graduate students, multiple undergraduates, and at least two Cambodian students; 2) share critical data and models through broad stakeholder engagement within the Mekong; 3) develop a novel online curriculum that enhances STEM capacity in sustainability by engaging 20 fisheries managers in quantitative modeling and tradeoff analysis led by ASU's EdPlus online learning program; and 4) improve scientific capacity in the region as MRB scientists develop and apply the project's advanced modeling systems. Local scientists and students will be trained in both field and statistical methods so that the research can be sustained beyond the project's duration.

1154,"Non-Technical Abstract:Electrons carry both electrical charge and, much like a top, angular momentum called  spin , and while ordinary electronic devices typically only use the charge, there is increasing interest in taking advantage of the spin for information storage and processing.  In some materials with particular structures, a current of charge in one direction can drive a current of spin in a transverse direction (the  spin Hall effect ), and a net imbalance of spin can build up at the material's surface.  In other materials (two-dimensional  topological insulators ), charge and spin are predicted to flow only around the perimeter of the material.  In both systems, because charge and spin come in discrete amounts and are coupled together, a lot can be learned about how they move by measuring not just the charge current, but fluctuations in the charge current called  shot noise .  This project measures the shot noise at radio frequencies produced by current flow along the edges of 2d topological insulators, to determine the nature of that edge transport and the scattering mechanisms that limit its flow.  This information is revealed by the geometry, temperature, and magnetic field dependence of the noise.  This project applies the same measurement approach to look for shot noise predicted to result when the spin Hall effect builds up spin polarization at a material surface.  This is one avenue to determine the amount of spin build-up without the need for complicated device structures involving magnetic materials. This project provides research training and professional development for two graduate students, as well as research opportunities for undergraduates.  Results are disseminated through publications, presentations at conferences and universities, and through the principal investigator's blog.  The principal investigator is working with K12 teachers and undergraduates to explain this and related research at level appropriate for a general audience, in writings distributed in the blog and in cooperation with the Houston Chronicle.  The principal investigator is also developing resources for science writers and journalists, to aid in explaining condensed matter and nanoscale physics concepts to the public.Technical Abstract:There is a growing appreciation that the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom of electrons provides opportunities to manipulate spin and create previously unprecedented electronic systems.  The intellectual merit of this effort focuses on understanding two physical systems.  In particular materials, band structure predicts the formation of a two-dimensional  topological insulator  state in the bulk, with topologically protected, 1d helical edge states girding the perimeter.  Understanding these edge states is essential for realizing their benefits in dissipationless transport and computing.    Electron-electron interactions, magnetic impurities, and disorder are expected to affect these edge states in ways testable through measurements of nonequilibrium noise in the edge state conduction.  In addition, the related spin Hall effect is a viable means of generating nonequilibrium spin accumulation in metals, with tremendous potential for information storage and processing.  Charge noise is predicted to be a way to characterize that spin accumulation without the need for ferromagnetic materials.  This project measures nonequilibrium noise and charge transport to examine edge states at 2d TI interfaces and SHE-driven spin accumulation in metal nanostructures.  Specific scientific questions include:  Are edge states at semiconductor heterointerfaces trivial or topological?  What limits ballistic transport in such edge states?  To what extent does spin accumulation from the spin Hall effect produce charge current noise?  These science questions have relevance for technological applications, including exotic computational architectures and magnetic information storage and processing.  Beyond technologies, the broader impacts of this project involve the professional training of graduate students and undergraduates as the next generation of technological workforce, and public outreach including K12 education.  The principal investigator works with Rice K12 programs and an ongoing Rice REU program focusing on Houston-area community college students; and public outreach based on his decade-established blog.  Specific products include a primer/guide to condensed matter/nano physics for science journalists;  tip-sheets  to science journalists regarding new developments in the field; and science writing contributions for the Houston Chronicle.

1155,"Rice, a staple food of more than four billion people, can serve as a primary route of human exposure to methylmercury (MeHg). Methylmercury bioaccumulates in organisms and is highly neurotoxic. Even at trace levels, MeHg adversely affects human health. By contrast, inorganic mercury is less bioavailable and does not bioaccumulate. Thus, MeHg contamination of rice is a global public health concern. The MeHg content of rice grain originates from the paddy soil, where it is taken up by rice roots and transported to the developing grain. All soils contain inorganic mercury derived from natural, as well as modern and historical anthropogenic sources. The MeHg in paddy soil is produced by aquatic microorganisms from this inorganic mercury, a process known as methylation. Another suite of microorganisms transform MeHg back into inorganic mercury, termed demethylation. The availability of MeHg for plant uptake depends on the relative rates of methylation and demethylation in the soil zone surrounding rice roots, an area called the rice rhizosphere. The roots of rice plants release both oxygen and organic carbon into rhizosphere soil. The supply of both organic carbon and oxygen can modulate methylation and demethylation. This project is clarifying how plant inputs of oxygen and organic carbon affect rates of methylation and demethylation and thus alter rhizosphere MeHg concentrations. Results can inform agricultural strategies to minimize MeHg contamination of rice grain. For example, findings may guide selection of rice cultivars that release oxygen and carbon in amounts and proportions that favor demethylation over methylation. Project personnel will disseminate results to K-12 students, laypeople, policymakers, and rice growers by creating an artistic, high-quality video that presents health hazards of MeHg in rice and other foods, introduces the complex MeHg cycle, and discusses strategies for minimizing MeHg production in rice paddies. The project combines experimental manipulations of root exudates and soil oxygenation with mercury isotope speciation methods and two-dimensional, real-time visualizations of rhizosphere oxygen concentrations to test hypotheses about how carbon and oxygen influence rates and spatial occurrence of methylation and demethylation within paddy soil. During peak vegetative growth, enriched isotope MeHg and inorganic mercury tracers are injected at the mm scale into rhizosphere soil, guided by oxygen visualizations, to assess rates of methylation and demethylation in different redox zones. After plants complete their lifecycle, grain is collected to identify the net, integrated effect of altered root exudation or soil oxygenation on MeHg concentrations in rice grain, the endpoint most relevant to human health. This unique approach allows examination of the spatial distribution and biogeochemical drivers of MeHg production at a fine scale in an intact, living, plant-soil system. Such spatial resolution is necessary to characterize how organic carbon and oxygen enhance or diminish the net production of MeHg in the rhizosphere of rice, and thus help control MeHg contamination of rice grain. Importantly, the project directly studies mercury demethylation, an important pathway for MeHg degradation in soils, but a process that is poorly understood in comparison to mercury methylation.

1156,"In humans, collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and is found in nearly every tissue. Collagen has a huge array of functions from toughening our bones and giving strength to our skin to playing a key role in immunity.  Collagen is constructed by a multistep sequence of self-assembly of the molecular components. Despite collagen's ubiquity and importance, the underlying structure, stability and mechanism of assembly are poorly understood.  Prof. Hartgerink of Rice University conducts research to determine the rules of collagen stability and probe the assembly mechanisms.  This fundamental knowledge could lead to a better understanding of diseases associated with collagen malfunction and also help with the design of next-generation biomaterials which mimic collagen.  This research project provides the basis for interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate education programs which combine chemical design with biology and medicine.  High school science teachers are recruited to work with the Hartgerink group in the summer to develop exciting curriculum based on cutting edge research that can be directly translated to their high school chemistry and biology courses.  These teachers later return with their entire science class for demonstrations and laboratory tours.  Integration of this interdisciplinary research with secondary education science goals helps to inspire both the students as well as their teachers toward STEM related fields.There are two main goals in this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the National Science Foundation. The first goal is to expand our knowledge of pairwise amino acid interactions in the triple helix, the fundamental unit of collagen self-assembly.  These pairwise interactions modulate the stability of triple helices as well as their self-assembly.  Expanding this knowledge base is helping us to understand this important and extremely abundant protein family. In addition, it is providing new tools for chemists to design collagen based materials which are important for a wide variety of biomedical applications.  The second goal is to describe a rational system for the specific molecular recognition of any member of the collagen family. These collagen targeting peptides (CTPs) use the pairwise interactions discovered above for sequence specific molecular recognition of a given collagen triple helix. CTPs work in highly complicated chemical environments such as a slice of tissue where hundreds of other competing molecules co-exist.

1157,"Non-Technical Abstract:The objective of this research is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various phases in iron-based superconductors, specifically the iron arsenide superconductors BaFe2-xNixAs2, (B,K)Fe2A2, and BaFe2As2-xPx, using neutron scattering as a primary tool. The research has two components: initial materials characterization and neutron scattering. For synthesis, a comprehensive materials laboratory was established and single crystals of the proposed materials can be grown at Rice.  The initial characterization of these single crystals is performed using facilities at Rice. Neutron scattering, the core part of this research program, is used to study the spin dynamical properties of these materials. In particular, the effect of uniaxial pressure on their structural, magnetic, and spin dynamical properties are studied. Uniaxial pressure can also detwin the sample and allow twin-free states of these materials to be explored. Technical Abstract:This NSF project addresses the fundamental physical processes that give rise to novel collective phenomena such as high-transition temperature superconductivity. The materials known to exhibit these collective phenomena are the strongly correlated electron materials. The understanding of these phenomena not only enhances our knowledge of basic science, but also give us the ability to design materials with novel and predictable properties. Specifically, the experimental research includes neutron scattering experiments aimed at the fundamental understanding of the spin excitations in a family of iron-based high-transition-temperature superconductors. The objective of the research is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various phases of iron-based superconductors using neutron as a probe. Neutron scattering experiments are performed mostly at the high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) and Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. However, the project also utilizes other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at HFIR and SNS. The impact of this research includes the training of the next generation of neutron scatters and elucidating the nature of the exotic properties of the correlated electron materials.

1158,"A challenge in modern data science is how to integrate information from 3-dimensional shapes into statistical models. Examples of applications where this challenge is central is associating the shape of a tumor to molecular processes or associating the shape of the roots of a rice plant to crop yield.  In graphics and anatomy, there is the related question of how to warp one object into another, such as the molar of a child to a molar of an adult.  This project seeks to develop methodology to transform these shape data, such as meshes or 3-dimensional images, into representations for which standard statistical models are available. These methods are crucial to advancing data-enabled science in extracting, conceptualizing, interpreting, and visualizing information residing in datasets comprising complex objects such 3D shapes.  Cutting edge ideas in mathematics, specifically from the field of geometry, will be used to address the fundamental problems of (i) modeling structural variation in diverse collections of shapes and (ii) modeling transformations between shapes. Solutions to these problems are crucial to many practical applications and disciplines including biology, medicine, social sciences, and ecology. As such, an important component of the project is validation of methods and tools through applications in radiology and anthropologyGeometric concepts beyond Riemannian geometry and smooth manifolds will be leveraged to develop novel statistical methodology to address complex challenges in data analysis.  Methods and tools, grounded on solid mathematical foundations, will be developed for modeling complex objects (such as shapes and surfaces) and complex relations within data (such as multi-commodity flow or aligning shapes).  The research will address two statistical challenges using geometric tools: (1) representing surfaces and shapes via integral geometry, and (2) learning group actions or transformations between pairs of objects using the geometry of fiber bundles.  Addressing the first challenge results in a framework for parametric and non-parametric statistical models for collections of shapes and surfaces, without the requirement of landmark points and without requiring the shapes to be isomorphic. Addressing the second challenge provides a statistical framework for alignment problems ranging from aligning a collection of shapes such as teeth, to optimization problems on networks such as multi-commodity flow.  The solutions proposed will impact statistics and geometry, and the methods may catalyze transformative advances in practical applications and scientific disciplines as diverse as biology, medicine, social sciences, and ecology. 3-Dimensional; Address; Adult; Anatomy; Biology; Child; Collection; Complex; Data; Data Analyses; Data Science; Data Set; Discipline; Ecology; Fiber; Foundations; geometric methodologies; Geometry; Image; Learning; Mathematics; Medicine; MeSH Thesaurus; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Modernization; Molecular; Names; novel; Plant Roots; Plants; practical application; Process; Radiology Specialty; Research; Rice; Science; Shapes; Social Sciences; Solid; Statistical Models; statistics; Structural Models; Surface; tool; Tooth structure; tumor; Validation; VariantBEYOND RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY IN INFERENCE",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,9.036043577998268e-05,1e-06
1159,"This project investigates the importance of convection and induction electric fields in the magnetosphere, and their relative roles in the dynamics of the ring current and the plasmasphere. Convection electric fields are generated by the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere.  They are directed approximately from dawn to dusk across the magnetotail and drive plasma sheet ions and electrons from the magnetotail towards the inner magnetosphere.  Along the way, convection electric fields play an important role in energizing these plasma sheet particles to high energies and in delivering them to build the storm-time ring current, a torus of high-energy ions and electrons surrounding the Earth.  Convection electric fields also play an important role in the location of plasma boundaries, such as the plasmapause.  The plasmapause is the steep outer boundary of the plasmasphere, a dense torus formed by the extension of cold ionospheric plasma into the inner magnetosphere.  This torus expands outward to occupy the region where the corotation electric field (a radial electric field produced by the movement of magnetic field lines in response to Earth's rotation) dominates over the convection electric field.  In disturbed times, the convection electric field strengthens with respect to the essentially unchanging corotation field, diminishing the region where the corotation field dominates.  As a result, the outer regions of the plasmasphere are stripped away and convected to the dayside magnetopause where the plasma is lost.  However, the electric field is more complicated than the superposition of these two large-scale electric fields.  Changing magnetic fields produce electric fields through induction. During magnetic substorms, explosive reconfigurations of the magnetotail fields produce significant  induction  electric fields that introduce smaller scale temporal and spatial variability into the magnetospheric electric field. The primary goal of this proposal is to quantify the relative contributions to inner magnetosphere dynamics of convection and induction electric fields.  A more complete understanding of all components of the magnetospheric electric field is important for developing improved space weather forecast models of value to society.  This project provides support for the research career of a productive female scientist, and a research experience for an undergraduate intern as well as yearly outreach activities aimed at K-12 students, thus contributing to the future scientific workforce and science literacy.  The primary tool for this investigation is a magnetically and electrically self-consistent model of the inner magnetosphere, the Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E). For storm events, measurements of the electric fields in the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere will be compared with the modeled RCM-E electric fields. Initially storms will be simulated with no explicit substorm magnetic field changes. The RCM-E magnetic field, energetic ion fluxes, electron densities, and precipitating electron fluxes will be compared with in-situ measurements by magnetospheric and ionospheric satellites. Finally, results of RCM-E geomagnetic storm simulations that incorporate the effects of substorm reconfigurations of the magnetotail fields will be compared with data to determine the role and importance of induced electric fields. career; Convection; Data; electric field; electron density; Electrons; equilibrium model; Event; experience; Female; Future; Goals; improved; In Situ; Internships; Investigation; Ions; K-12 student; literacy; Location; magnetic field; Magnetism; Measurement; Modeling; Movement; Names; outreach; particle; Plasma; Play; Radial; Research; Research Support; response; Rice; Role; Rotation; Science; Scientist; simulation; Societies; solar wind; Time; tool; WeatherGEM: ASSESSING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF CONVECTION AND INDUCED ELECTRIC FIELDS FOR PARTICLE TRANSPORT AND ENERGIZATION IN THE INNER MAGNETOSPHERE",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
1160,"Non-technical DescriptionThis Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) award is a joint project among the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Arkansas State University, and Kansas State University.  The project will create the foundational knowledge needed to improve wheat and rice yields under stressful environments. Trends at the global-, regional-, and farm-level point to an increase in minimum night temperatures that is significantly higher than the rate of increase in maximum day temperatures. Increases in night temperatures significantly decrease the grain yield and quality of major crops such as rice and wheat, which together provide over 50% of the caloric intake for humans worldwide. To ensure global food security, there is an urgent need to improve crop resilience to high night temperature stress-induced yield and quality losses. This project will build upon complementary expertise and infrastructure in Nebraska, Kansas, and Arkansas to develop novel research infrastructure and make discoveries that ultimately lead to development of higher yielding and resilient cultivars for the U.S. farmers. This program will create opportunities to collaborate with key industry partners to ensure that promising discoveries are translated into applications with economic benefit for farmers. Planned workforce development activities will focus on mentoring six early career faculty members, training of postdocs and graduate and undergraduate students, and broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities and underserved rural population in STEM fields.Technical DescriptionThis project aims to elucidate the physiological and genetic basis of high night temperature resiliency of rice and wheat, translate these discoveries into genetic and phenotypic markers for public and private breeding programs, and develop a broad continuum for STEM education. To this end, the investigators are taking a multidisciplinary approach involving plant physiologists, quantitative geneticists, computational biologists, biochemists, engineers, informaticians, and precision agronomists. This program is building genome to phenome linkages using automated image-based phenomics approaches in combination with transcriptomics and metabolomics applied to wheat and rice diversity panels. Gene and pathways discovered from this approach will be functionally tested for their role in improving the temperature resilience in rice and wheat. The planned approach integrates across greenhouse and field scales; captures complex interactions between the environment and genome during grain development at high spatiotemporal resolution; and couples genomics and phenomics outcomes within a quantitative, model-based framework. This research will make the integrated dataset more accessible to biologists through a visualization platform.  Six early career faculty will be mentored for professional progress and interactions with international phenomic communities. An Interdisciplinary graduate course will be developed for students in plant sciences, agricultural engineering, computational biology, biochemistry, statistics, and computer sciences. On-line offerings of this course will ensure student participation from all three participating universities.

1161,"This award provides support for the 2017 Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium that will take place at the University of Texas at Austin in the 2017 fall semester. The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin, and occasionally other institutions in the region. It is intended for the participation of around 60 people, including 25 non-local graduate students. The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have an opportunity to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium consists of 7 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions (including a poster session) for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The Symposium is a forum for regional specialists in mathematical physics and related areas of analysis to become familiar with the latest problems and present their own results; in addition it introduces young mathematicians to the current state of the subject.This year's Symposium will focus on the areas where dispersive partial differential equations, statistical mechanics, and harmonic analysis intersect and interact.

1162,"Anatoly Kolomeisky of William Marsh Rice University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division to theoretically investigate interactions between two major classes of biological molecules: DNA and proteins. This project is co-funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division.  DNA encodes the genetic plans for all living organisms. Proteins read this information and implement it in the cell. Proper timing is a key aspect of protein-DNA interactions due to the dynamic nature of living cells. If the proper interactions do not occur at the right time, the entire biological system can fail catastrophically. Understanding protein-DNA interactions can lead to new insights for drug discovery and contribute to technological breakthroughs such as bio-inspired or biomimetic materials. Professor Kolomeisky is combining theoretical modeling, simulation, and bioinformatics to understand the molecular foundations of the temporal dependence and efficiency of protein-DNA interactions. Specific questions include: how proteins identify the correct DNA binding sites in performing their functions; the effects of DNA loop formation on multi-site proteins that can bind at different DNA sites; mechanisms of DNA editing using the newly-discovered CRISPR associated protein technology; and understanding the tradeoff between strong binding and fast recognition in determining how proteins bind to DNA. Close collaborations with experimental and theoretical groups will enable testing of the new models, and promote a deeper understanding of these complex natural processes.  Professor Kolomeisky is providing opportunities for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in this research and gain valuable training and experience for their future careers. Outreach activities include a high-school scientific projects competition, co-organization of an undergraduate chemistry research symposium, public lectures delivered at venues such as the Rice Science Caf?, and continued collaboration with the Rice robotics systems lab to create online games based on the results of this research.This project focuses on developing a theoretical program to analyze the temporal dependence of protein-DNA interactions. These fundamental interactions are analyzed using a variety of theoretical tools including discrete-state stochastic models, first-passage analysis, bioinformatics methods and extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations. The advantage of this multiscale approach is that it takes into account in a consistent manner the major physical and chemical properties of DNA and proteins interacting in the complex cellular environment. In collaboration with experimental research groups, theoretical predictions are tested using various techniques, including single-molecule spectroscopy, chemical kinetics, and bioinformatic analysis. An outreach program developed by Professor Kolomeisky provides the opportunity for local high-school students and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups to participate in scientific research in an academic setting. The project also highlights the benefits of science for society by directly presenting scientific findings to the local community in the informal setting of caf? discussions, as well as communicating with science writers in local newspapers and participating in scientific Internet blog discussions. The broader impacts of this project include a multidisciplinary training program for young researchers of different levels that will prepare them better for future technological and industrial challenges.

1163,"With this award the CTMC program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Cecelia Clementi at Rice University to develop models for studying properties of matter at various scales. A fundamental challenge for the chemical sciences is to bridge the gap between the ability to study and manipulate matter at the atomistic scale with the desire to understand and predict properties at a macroscopic scale. Recently, there has been an immense increase in high-throughput and high-resolution technologies for experimental observation. In addition there is an increase in high-performance techniques to simulate molecular systems at a microscopic level. These advances have resulted in a vast and ever-increasing amounts of high-dimensional data. Consequently, there is a recent surge of interest in data analysis techniques. In particular, techniques that extract essential features, collective variables or representative states from simulations. These simulation data have to be reconciles with experimental data. However, with very few exceptions, these reconciling techniques are purely descriptive and do not allow the formulation of general principles regulating the macroscopic behavior. Furthermore it is difficult to scale up towards significantly larger and more complex systems. This project develops a new and general approach to address this challenge. The approaches are applicable to very different chemical systems, ranging from signal transduction in cells, over heterogeneous catalysis to the design of polymer brushes. The proposed research impacts a large interdisciplinary community of students and researchers in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. The project undertakes curriculum development in computational and mathematical methods applied to chemical systems. Curriculum development includes undergraduate and graduate courses. The project is also recruiting and mentoring women and minority undergraduate and graduate students. This activity is conducted through a collaboration with the Tapia Center at Rice University.The project is developing a general framework to obtain the effective dynamical models (structure, equations and parameters) governing molecular systems. The key hypothesis is that, in order to be able to understand and model macroscopic systems, there is a need to use purely descriptive models to define generative models from data. Models are developed at the mesoscale from microscale simulations and multiscale experimental data. The approach is fundamentally different from available coarse-graining techniques or model reduction methods. Both the form of the macroscopic model as well as the effective dynamical equations are learned from data. Functional building blocks that can be embedded in higher order simulations are generated in order to bridge the gap between microscopic and macroscopic systems. The method investigates if and how relatively general organizing principles emerge from the interactions of a multitude of atomic degrees of freedoms in different chemical systems. This modeling approach has the potential to serve as a keystone to integrate vast amounts of chemical data into quantitative, mechanistic and comprehensible models. Such models are able to explain how different molecular components organize and interact as a function of time and space in performing functions at the macroscopic scale.

1164,"Thermal energy, also known as heat, flows naturally from hot objects to cold objects. One consequence of this heat flow is that it is difficult to create objects with localized  hot spots,  even when heat is applied to a single spot.

1167,"This project will examine the roles that telomeres, the DNA sequences that form the ends of chromosomes, play in chromosome evolution and in making new genes. The project will study chromosome ends in the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae - a devastating pathogen of rice and wheat plants. Of the more than 20 known genes that control fungus interactions with the host plants, at least 50% are found close to the telomeres. It has long been a puzzle as to how (and why) these genes find their ways to the chromosome ends. Recent work has shown that the M. oryzae chromosome ends undergo rearrangements at spectacularly high frequencies and this can lead to the capture and duplication of internal sequences at the chromosome ends. This, in turn, causes the formerly subtelomeric sequences to be relegated to the chromosome interior. This project will use DNA sequencing and related data analysis methods to test the hypothesis that telomere dynamics is a major driver of chromosome evolution. This project largely involves DNA sequencing and associated data analysis techniques (bioinformatics). Individuals with the relevant cross-training in biology and computer science are rare and collaborations between individuals from the two domains are challenged by differences in their training and skills. Recognizing a national need for individuals with dual domain expertise, most of the objectives for this project will be completed through research experiences for teams of biology and computer science undergraduates from the partner institutions of the Univ. of Kentucky, Northern Kentucky Univ., Eastern Kentucky Univ. and Western Kentucky Univ., with specific efforts being made to enhance participation for student populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM research.Despite intense interest in telomere biology and the importance of the associated chromosome regions (subtelomeres) in cellular biology, organismal adaptation and evolution, the organization of chromosome ends and their dynamics is poorly understood due to poor representation in genome assemblies. The central hypothesis driving this project is that the telomere regions are the main factories of fungal genome evolution, whereby recurrent bouts of telomere crisis provide the fuel for raw materials recruitment and telomere rescue pathways act to generate novel sequences. It has long been proposed that fungal genomes might evolve through such  Adaptive Telomere Failure  (ATF) but, until now, no examples had been identified. This project will greatly expand knowledge on fungal genome structure and reveal the full impact of ATF on genome organization and evolution. Additionally, it is suspected that enhanced rates of nucleotide substitution/indel polymorphism in the subtelomeric regions may further accelerate the neo-functionalization of terminally captured sequences. This project will test a number of predictions related to these hypotheses, while seeking to gain an improved understanding of subtelomere-internal genome sequence exchange, as it relates to fungal genome structure and host adaptation. Specific objectives include: 1. Generate end-to-end genome assemblies for the main host-specialized forms of M. oryzae and characterize the structural and genic diversity of the subterminal chromosome regions. 2. Assess the impact of telomere dynamics on M. oryzae genome evolution by identifying and characterizing internalized relics of former telomeres; 3. Examine genome reorganization following spontaneous or experimentally-induced telomere crisis events; and 4. Accomplish project objectives through  bite-sized  undergraduate research projects that foster collaboration between biologists and computer scientists.

This project will center on college algebra for students who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) and those who have other print disabilities. These populations have historically been underserved by college mathematics pedagogies. Investigators at Auburn University at Montgomery (AUM) have developed an innovative, evidence-based method of mathematics instruction and assessment, called Process-Driven Math (PDM), which substantially reduces barriers to participation for this population. The PDM method is based on an interactive auditory/verbal exchange of language between the student and a human intermediary who functions as both reader and scribe. For this project, AUM is partnering with Rice University, Auburn University, and Bridge Multimedia to investigate the benefits of PDM for teaching as well as assessing student learning. The research and development activities will focus specifically on college algebra courses, with related attention to algebra courses at schools for the blind. Those activities will be conducted at four institutions of higher education, including one two-year college, and three state schools for the blind. The project will be conducted by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in mathematics, mathematics education, special education, education research, and mathematics accessibility.The specific objective of the project is to further develop, test, refine, and prepare Process-Driven Math for scaling to improve mathematics learning for all students (students with and without disabilities; STEM and non-STEM majors). The enormity of syntax in algebraic expressions creates barriers (e.g., cognitive load) for many students with disabilities who access their mathematics by listening to it. The PDM method employs chunking, which reduces the cognitive load on working memory for mathematics students who are BVI.

1170,"CBET - 1705703PI: Biswal, Sibani L.Coalescence of liquid droplets and aggregation of colloidal particles are important in materials processing applications and in naturally-occurring processes.  Coalescence and aggregation have been studied extensively for droplets and particles that are freely suspended in bulk liquids.  This award will support research into aggregation of colloidal particles that are confined to a surface.  The dynamics of aggregation in this case are expected to be fundamentally different than aggregation of particles in the bulk.  The key challenge in studying aggregation is to control the forces between particles that can lead to aggregation.  In this project, that challenge will be addressed by using clusters of superparamagnetic particles and placing the system in a rotating magnetic field.  The aggregation of the colloidal clusters will be examined under conditions where the forces between the clusters can be tuned and are known at all times.   The dynamics of cluster aggregation, changes in the arrangement of particles within the clusters, and the resulting structure that is obtained after aggregation will be studied.  The results will be useful to material scientists and process engineers who are developing new two-dimensional materials that have unique electronic, optical, or catalytic properties.  It will also provide new insight into other engineered materials that have interfaces or grain boundaries that can affect materials processing and reliability.  The project will engage students at various academic levels, including community college students who participate in a summer program at Rice.  Demonstrations of the unique properties of magnetic colloidal suspensions will be developed for local high-school students.This award will support an experimental study of coalescence and aggregation of two-dimensional colloidal clusters.  The clusters will consist of micron-sized superparamagnetic colloidal particles dispersed in aqueous solution. A high frequency rotating magnetic field will be applied, resulting in a long-range, isotropic attractive interaction potential between the paramagnetic colloids that can be precisely tuned from 3kBT to 40kBT by varying the strength of the magnetic field.  The experiments will determine how the interactional potential influences properties such as line tension and interfacial thickness. The experiment will be designed to monitor coalescence and aggregation as a function of interaction potential and to understand how void spaces are annealed during the assembly of clusters. Finally, the project will focus on the formation of disclinations and defects in two-dimensional systems and their implications on two-dimensional cluster dynamics.

1171,"The aim of this project is to discover mutations in rice that increase photosynthesis efficiency. Plants capture the energy of sunlight through photosynthesis to produce sugars, starch, and a multitude of biologically active energy-rich molecules of life. Improving the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants, making it stable to environmental stresses, would provide us with a sustainable supply of food and nutrition as well as renewable energy to maintain the needs of the growing population. This interdisciplinary project will offer practical training to graduate and undergraduate students. This project also will produce hands-on laboratory exercises to improve knowledge of undergraduate and graduate students on plant diversity and environmental challenges affecting food security, and broadening the impact of plant sciences in STEM education. In addition, K-12 students from the Arkansas agricultural areas in the Delta region will be engaged by a STEM literacy outreach program providing experience in experimental plant sciences aimed at caring for the environment. The project will use an integrated systems genetics approach to dissect the complex pathways of plant photosynthesis driving plant development and productivity. Genome wide association analysis of a diverse rice population identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with several parameters for photosynthetic efficiency.  These SNPs will be used to identify the key genes determining important natural variation for photosynthesis. To understand the regulation of these interacting processes, it is essential to go beyond individual gene action or biochemical pathways. The integrated network approach employed will help place multiple genetically defined photosynthetic parameters in the context of gene regulatory pathways that underpin response to external factors, growth and development. A diverse set of computational formulations will be integrated into a consensus network using rank-based protocols, an approach proven to be robust for prediction of functional relationships. Predicted transcription factors will be tested in high throughput assays for their ability to activate photosynthesis genes in vivo, and confirmed in transgenic plants to unravel their downstream regulatory pathways. The systems genetic information from these genotypes will be used to reconstruct improved plants and crops with modular improvements in photosynthetic-based processes for diverse needs.This project is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the NSF EPSCoR Program.

1172,"Large or great earthquakes that occur along subduction zones rupture large portions of the fault interfaces, releasing substantial accumulated energy capable of causing catastrophic damage and disruption. As such earthquakes define a major geohazard, particularly to coastal areas vulnerable to large tsunami, understanding the controls on earthquake size and the predictors of their occurrence along megathrust faults is of critical societal relevance to the US and around the world. This project will provide new insights into how and why earthquakes occur on these major faults, and what determines how large they can become. We will use numerical modeling to simulate the conditions present in such settings, to predict fault behavior. Earthquakes are of great popular interest, and our models of virtual earthquakes will provide a stimulating way to inform the public about natural processes and their effects. We will prepare and distribute animations of our earthquake simulations and related phenomena by way of a webpage, and communicate our science through collaborative arrangements with local schools and Rice teacher training courses. We will also develop new course materials that can be used in undergraduate geology courses. In this study, we will carry out a systematic modeling study using particle dynamics simulations to examine the controls on seismic and aseismic slip on numerical analogs of heterogeneous faults modeled after subduction megathrusts. Consistent with subduction megathrusts, our research will focus on asymmetric faults in which stress and strength vary along the length of the fault. We will use these simulations to develop catalogs of slip events in both 2D and 3D, and then probe conditions along the fault before, during, and after the events to gain insights into the conditions that initiate unstable sliding, and those that cause run-away slip to stop. The overarching questions we plan to address are: (1) What controls the size of an earthquake? Is earthquake size predetermined, and if so, by what? (2) Are there any consistent precursory phenomena (e.g., deformation) or properties changes that can inform us about the onset of seismic slip? To address these questions, we will probe the model data, including particle displacements, forces, packing arrangements, etc., to obtain direct constraints on stress and strains and their variations in space and time, as well as evolving mechanical properties such as friction, dilatancy, strength, and stiffness. In this way, we can explore specific controls on earthquake rupture and other slip behaviors. We will also compare our catalogs of simulated earthquakes, correlated with the properties changes listed above, with natural systems. Our models will help to clarify the characteristics of faults responsible for different types of earthquakes, and the processes that initiate and limit them, advancing our knowledge in this area. This project will support one graduate student and one undergraduate student, and formalize interdisciplinary collaborations at Rice.

1173,"Abstract:Nontechnical:The flow of heat and electric charge are coupled together, and these thermoelectric effects underpin diverse critical technologies, including thermostats, electrically driven refrigerators, and photodetectors.  Thermoelectric properties can be engineered by structuring materials on the nanoscale.  Using a scanning laser as a moveable heat source, the PI's group has revealed unexpected thermoelectric effects even in nominally simple metal structures.  Specifically, grain boundaries and surface chemistry can modify thermoelectric response, and greatly enhanced photo-voltages are possible in structures where electrons have to  tunnel  across a nanoscale gap between metal electrodes. This project will confirm the mechanisms behind these surprising features, and build upon this knowledge to create and characterize prototypes of new photodetectors based on metal optical antennas.  While not as sensitive as semiconductor-based photodetectors, metal optical antenna systems are geometrically tunable, have different noise processes, and can be simpler to fabricate.  Results will be disseminated via publications, presentations at conferences, and popular writings by the PI on his blog.  This project will provide training and professional development to graduate students and undergraduate researchers, aiding in the creation of the next generation of a technologically skilled and innovative workforce.   The PI will also work with K12 teachers and undergraduates from other institutions through ongoing Rice programs.  Through his blog and writings in collaboration with the Houston Chronicle, the PI will continue to popularize nanoscale science and engineering in general, and this project's research outcomes in particular.Technical:Nanostructured thermoelectric devices have enormous potential as technologies and as tools to acquire the basic scientific and engineering knowledge necessary to control and optimize the flow of energy at the nanoscale.  By coupling electronic transport measurements and illumination via a scanning laser microscope, the PI's group has found unexpected photothermoelectric effects in nominally simple metal nanostructures.  Metal nanowires demonstrate previously unreported inhomogeneities in Seebeck response, indicating that grain boundaries and surface chemistry can be tools for engineering thermoelectric response.  Nanoscale tunneling gaps between metallic electrodes show greatly enhanced photovoltages compared to nontunneling structures, with material and polarization dependences that are consistent with plasmon-enhanced hot electron tunneling as the mechanism.   The intellectual merit of this project lies in its three specific research goals:  quantifying and engineering photothermoelectric effects in metal nanostructures through control of surface conditions (via self-assembled monolayers) and grain structure; understanding and optimizing greatly enhanced thermoelectric effects in nanogaps; and demonstrating photodetectors based on these enhanced photothermoelectric effects, looking at sensitivity and noise properties.  The PI's team of graduate and undergraduate students will collaborate with theorists in modeling the optoelectronic and thermal transport processes at work in these structures, providing critical feedback for optimization of response.  Results will be disseminated broadly through publications, presentations at conferences, and when appropriate the PI's blog.  This project will provide training and professional development to graduate students and undergraduate researchers, aiding in the creation of the next generation of a technologically skilled and innovative workforce.

1174,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is revolutionizing how farmers grow their crops and significantly reduced the dependence on fertilizers or pesticides to maximize yields. Understanding how to manipulate natural components of the plant stress response to provide desirable beneficial traits will potentially lead to reductions in chemical use in agriculture.  This technology provides a novel mechanism to express broad spectrum immune response that would normally stunt plant growth. This novel mechanism has large potential societal and commercial impacts. Currently, agricultural companies express resistance genes using promoter systems that are specific for one strain of pathogen. Each resistance gene included in the plant seed results in a negative fitness cost. The technology developed here can potentially eliminate the need to express multiple resistance genes by replacing them with one broad spectrum resistance gene.This I-Corps project further develops a TBF1-Control Cassette technology (TCC) to regulate translation that is both inducible and specific. Current gene expression methods are primarily based on transcriptional regulation utilizing synthetic or native promoters, which were shown to be insufficient in overcoming negative fitness costs associated with expression of stress response genes. The TCC technology remediates these negative fitness cost by  stalling  the translation of the gene of interest until a trigger is present. This mechanism allows for the accumulation of transcripts without the subsequent translation, and hence no negative fitness costs until the protein is translated. The technology was proven to work in rice and can be applied to other economically important crops, such as wheat or corn.

1175,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Hafner at Rice develops a new way to measure the structure of biomolecules in the membranes that surround cells.  In biology, a biomolecule's structure drives its function, so measuring structures is an important step in understanding life at the molecular scale. Molecules that are components of membranes are not soluble in water so it is a challenging task to solve their structures.  Hafner and his group attach these molecules to gold nanoparticles and analyze light that is scattered from them.  The nanoparticles focus light to the molecular scale. By monitoring how light scattered, a molecular structure can be determined.  This new methodology will be applied to open questions in understanding the function of membranes in biology, as well as helping to understand the effects of molecular probes and drugs widely used in chemical and biological research.  Professor Hafner also works on developing course materials on three fundamental scientific concepts behind this research: light waves, light scattering, and molecular vibrations.  The developed materials are to be used in the high school teacher professional development programs offered by Rice University where most teachers are coming from Houston Independent School District (HISD).The researcher team develops a new method for biomembrane molecular structure analysis that they have recently concept-proofed. Specifically, lipid membranes is applied to the surface of gold nanorods in solution, and their surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is recorded. The electromagnetic near field of the gold nanorods (responsible for enhancement) and the Raman scattering tensors of the molecules of interest are calculated by the finite element method (FEM) and time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), respectively. Unenhanced Raman spectra in the absence of gold nanorods are also recorded. Due to the alignment and rapid decay of the near field enhancement, these experimental and theoretical results are then combined through a ratiometric analysis to yield the position and orientation of molecular constituents responsible for specific vibrations. The researchers have recently demonstrated this by measuring the position and orientation of tryptophan in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine lipid membranes. The specific research objectives include: (1) Vibrational markers will be established to further analyze lipid membrane structure as well as the variety of lipids that can be included; (2) The effect of nanorod curvature on the lipid membrane structure will be evaluated; (3) Photothermal heating of the membrane due to laser excitation will be calculated based on the ratio of Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering; (4) The position of tryptophan residues in a model alpha helix will be studied, as well as the peptide chain and the effect on membrane structure; and (5) The membrane position and orientation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and fluorescent membrane probes, and their impact on membrane structure, will be determined. alpha helix; base; biological research; Biology; Cells; Chemicals; Chemistry; density; dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; Electromagnetics; electromagnetism; Elements; Gold; Heating; High School Faculty; Image; interest; Lasers; learning materials; Life; Light; light scattering; Lipids; Measurement; Measures; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Probes; molecular scale; Molecular Structure; Monitor; Names; nanoparticle; nanorod; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids; Positioning Attribute; professor; Program Development; programs; ratiometric; Research; Research Personnel; Rice; school district; Structure; Surface; teacher; theories; Time; Tryptophan; Universities; vibration; Water; WorkMEMBRANE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS BY ENHANCED RAMAN SCATTERING",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,2.114477837215332e-05,1e-06

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institutions for the fellowship are Duke University and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI; Philippines). The sponsoring scientists are Drs. Thomas Mitchell-Olds and Shalabh Dixit. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.To achieve lower production costs for rice the current agricultural trend is to shift from transplanting seedlings to direct sowing of seeds. Those seeds may have to germinate under anaerobic conditions due to flash flooding. The study of complex genetic variation and physiology in rice under anaerobic germination is necessary to produce seeds with traits that can fulfill societal and agronomical needs.  The training objectives in this project are to: 1) learn experimental and analytical approaches for genome association analysis of complex trait variation; 2) learn data analysis approaches that involve genome association and physiology data using machine learning implementation; and, 3) participate and lead outreach activities for minority groups and develop a multi-year curriculum focused on food security with Maureen Joy Charter School in Durham (NC). This project will study complex genetic variation and physiology of anaerobic germination (AG) in rice natural populations, by using new analytical methods to integrate diverse functional information to identify complex trait loci in genome wide association studies (GWAS). These methods can be applied to a range of traits in genetically tractable species. The main research goal is to identify candidate genes that influence quantitative variation for AG in rice, and to determine their mode of action. Specific objectives are to: 1) use GWAS to identify candidate genes associated with AG in sequenced rice genotypes; and, 2) determine the physiological and genetic correlations that contribute towards AG in rice.

The host institution for the fellowship is Pennsylvania State University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jesse Lasky. Agronomic weeds pose a serious threat to agricultural productivity, and weed infestations may intensify under changing climates. To better understand interactions between biotic and abiotic stressors, this project investigates mechanisms of specialization to different host crops and abiotic environments in purple witchweed (Striga hermonthica).  Parasitic witchweeds constitute the greatest biotic constraint to food production in sub-Saharan Africa and devastate yields of economically important cereals such as maize, sorghum, millet, and rice.  Broader impacts include generation of new genomic and phenotypic resources to enhance development of resistant crop varieties, training of undergraduate students, and workshops in witchweed bioinformatics targeted to African scientists.  Training objectives include statistical evolutionary genomics, ancient DNA sequencing, quantitative genetics, and experimental plant-parasite interactions.The main goal of this project is to better understand evolution of crop-parasite interactions across diverse abiotic environments. First, genomic signatures of host-specialization and local adaptation will be identified, using targeted exome sequencing of 200 herbarium specimens collected within the past 150 years from different hosts of origin across East and West Africa. Loci will be identified that exhibit statistical associations with environment and host of origin, with allelic variation that tracks change in regional host crop production over time. For the second aim, effects of abiotic stress on host range will be experimentally evaluated. Seed germination, early host-seeking behavior, and host resistance will be quantified under nitrogen- and water-limitation for 20 parasite populations across 60 genotypes of three agriculturally important host crops: sorghum, millet, and maize.  Genomic and phenotypic resources generated during the project will be publicly accessible through online databases (NCBI; Project Unity, http://phenome-networks.com) and a dedicated project website including instructional materials, code, and molecular protocols.

1178,"To survive, plants and animals must tolerate environmental stress. Two common environmental stressors of plants are flooding and drought. Successful completion of the proposed objectives will validate the function of novel genes and associated pathways that that allow the plant to live through periods of prolonged flooding, and paradoxically, also allow plants to survive drought conditions. The researchers and their colleagues have discovered that, while most types of rice die after three days of complete submergence during flooding, those carrying the Submergence tolerance 1 (SUB1) gene can tolerate this stress, and live through severe flooding events.  This project will explore how the SUB1 gene, and the genes that it interacts with, are able to promote tolerance to flooding and to drought.  The proposed experiments are also expected to lead to important new insights into plant biology with applications to agricultural productivity in one of the world's most important crops. The lead researcher, Ronald, serves as the faculty director of the UC Davis World Food Center's Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy, where she will continue her work to engage the public on issues related to plant genetics and the science and technology of food production. Students at levels from high school interns to postdoctoral fellows, will be involved in carrying out the work and in outreach activities.Whereas most rice plants die after three days of complete submergence, those carrying the Submergence tolerance 1 (SUB1) locus are tolerant. The Ronald laboratory and collaborators demonstrated that the rice SUB1 locus encodes three Ethylene Responsive Factor (ERF) transcriptional regulators, SUB1A, SUB1B, and SUB1C and that overexpression of the SUB1A is sufficient to confer submergence tolerance to intolerant rice varieties. The SUB1 locus has also been shown to promote plant survival during drought. The Ronald lab further demonstrated that an uncharacterized member of the OsGTgamma-2 family of GT factors, a novel SANT domain-containing protein called SAB18, (SUB1A BINDING PROTEIN 18), binds SUB1A in yeast. SAB18 overexpression confers SUB1A-dependent enhanced submergence tolerance and remarkably robust drought tolerance. Furthermore SUB1/SAB18ox plants display a reduction of leaf water loss and lipid peroxidation indicating that SAB18 enhances oxidative stress tolerance. The Ronald lab also isolated three fast neutron (FN)-irradiated mutants that serve as SUPPRESSORS OF STRESS TOLERANCE MEDIATED BY SUB1 (sst). The researchers hypothesize that SAB18 positively regulates SUB1A-mediated stress tolerance by forming a protein complex with SUB1A, which binds and activates the promoters of SUB1A, SAB18 and/or genes conferring stress tolerance. It is further hypothesized that the genes encoded by the sst locus are required for these activities. To test these models the researchers propose to: 1) Identify genes and pathways regulated by SAB18. 2) Determine the mechanism of action of SAB18/SUB1A-mediated stress tolerance. 3) Characterize three sst mutants and identify the genes corresponding to the mutations using a whole genome resequencing approach.

1179,"PI: Jacot, Jeffrey    Proposal Number: 1547838Heart failure is the major cause of death in the U.S., and heart defects are the major cause of death in infants. This project will design, build and validate a device that can be used at a hospital to create living heart tissue for repair of failing hearts and heart defects. Clinicians would inject a patient's own cells into the device, which would then automatically control the release of chemicals required to make living heart muscle. In about 2 weeks, surgeons would open the device, remove the heart muscle, and use it to restructure a failing or malformed heart. This technology could transform the clinical approach to heart disease and heart defects, and could produce the first regenerative cure for these conditions.The implementation of novel and transformative therapies using cardiac tissue derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) requires the development of new technologies that can efficiently create heart tissue from pluripotent stem cells and ensure elimination of tumorigenic undifferentiated cells without laboratory intervention or extensive processing. This can be accomplished with a closed bioreactor system to create engineered cardiac tissue from iPSC. The intellectual merit of this proposal is based on the hypothesis that a bioreactor containing a pump, heart matrix-based hydrogel, and nanoparticles controlling the timed release of differentiation factors can create a 3-D contractile cardiac tissue with organization and function similar to native tissue. To test this hypothesis, a closed-system bioreactor that pumps media through cardiac matrix hydrogels along with silica nanoparticles that release cardiac differentiation factors will be constructed and tested with human iPSC. The release of factors shown to eliminate pluripotent cells will purify the tissue and prevent the implantation of tumorigenic cells and this will be verified through PCR and immunostaining. Finally, tissues with suturable scaffolds will be generated and implanted into a rat model of cardiac defect repair. The broader educational and social impacts of this proposal are integrated with the intellectual merit and include outreach activities with several Houston high schools though the Rice K-12 Initiative to bring increased awareness of biotechnology, biomaterials and stem cells among high school students and increased participation of high school students in science & engineering. 3-Dimensional; Awareness; base; Biocompatible Materials; Biomanufacturing; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Cardiac; Cause of Death; Cell Differentiation process; Cells; chemical release; Clinical; controlled release; design; Development; Devices; Engineering; Ensure; Failure; Heart; Heart Abnormalities; Heart Diseases; high school; High School Student; Hospitals; Human; Hydrogels; Implant; implantation; induced pluripotent stem cell; Infant; Injectable; Intervention; Laboratories; Modeling; Myocardium; Names; nanoparticle; new technology; novel; outreach; Patients; Pluripotent Stem Cells; prevent; Pump; Rattus; regenerative; release factor; repaired; Rice; scaffold; Science; Silicon Dioxide; Social Impacts; Stem cells; Surgeon; Surgical sutures; System; Technology; Testing; Tissue Engineering; tissue repair; Tissues; tumorigenic; Tumorigenicity; UndifferentiatedEAGER: BIOMANUFACTURING: CELL DIFFERENTIATION BIOREACTOR FOR CARDIAC TISSUE ENGINEERING",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,3.148348509280719e-06,1e-06
1180,"The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) will take place on April 21-23 2017 at Rice University in Houston, Texas. TAGS is an annual conference that is hosted on a rotating basis by Rice University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Texas at Austin. Many phenomena in nature can be modeled using systems of polynomial equations. The study of such systems is an important area of mathematics known as algebraic geometry. This grant supports participation in a conference in this subject, providing investigators from Texas and neighboring states an opportunity to learn the newest developments in this field from distinguished invited speakers. This conference is also an important opportunity for local researchers, especially graduate students and postdocs, to meet and interact, gaining exposure for their work and potentially establishing new collaborations.The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium provides an opportunity for local researchers to meet and interact, as well as learn the latest advances in algebraic geometry, interpreted in its broadest sense. This year, specific areas of focus include Hodge theory, moduli theory of curves, derived categories, Chow groups, and algebraic K-theory. Young mathematicians (graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) will have the opportunity to present their work in a poster session.

1181,"Upon recognition of pathogen attack, plants turn on immune responses to defend themselves from pathogens. The immune signaling network controls the immune response. This research is aimed at answering two questions. (1) How did the sophisticated immune signaling network in contemporary land plants arise during their evolution? (2) How much diversity in the signaling network exists among different flowering plants?  Question (2) will be answered by comparing in detail how the signaling network operates in three diverse flowering plant species, tomato, rice, and the model plant Arabidopsis. The results of the research will provide an example of how sophisticated biological systems can evolve. They will also provide ideas about how the plant immune signaling network can be engineered to improve disease resistance in crops. As outreach, a mobile conservatory will be developed and used to teach 3rd grade students about how plants adapt to their environments.The immune signaling network in the model plant Arabidopsis is highly resilient against pathogen attack on its components. This research will investigate when during the evolution of land plants such a highly resilient signaling network was acquired. This will be achieved by interrogating when specific immune-related subfamilies neofunctionalized within larger protein families using phylogenetic analysis of protein families of diverse land plant species. The subfamily analysis method will be automated and applied at the genome scale to investigate the times at which the networks controlling various other biological processes evolved. Key network components are generally conserved among angiosperms. However, it has never been investigated whether the state of a network (the set of network parameters) is also conserved. The immune signaling network state will be compared among three diverse angiosperm species, Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice. It will be achieved by combinatorially perturbing key network hubs using mutations, measuring the effects of the perturbations on the immune response using transcriptome analysis and other methods, and comparing the relationships among the key network hubs among the three species. This research will provide insights into how a highly resilient biological network has evolved and reveal the extent to which the structure and state of the immune signaling network have diverged among angiosperms.

1182,"Computational Imaging (CI) has emerged as a powerful tool for the design of imaging systems over a wide variety of applications, including consumer imaging, machine vision, surveillance, remote sensing, and microscopy. The key idea behind CI is that joint design and optimization of optics, sensors and algorithms rapidly enlarges the design space for imaging enabling performance characteristics that were hitherto unachievable. This project develops novel imaging systems that can break through the barriers of size, spatial resolution, temporal resolution, field of view, weight and cost by leveraging on the co-design of optics and signal processing. Imaging as such, has a very broad range of applications spanning consumer/medical/scientific imaging, machine vision and remote sensing. In conjunction with advancing the scientific goals of this project, the project integrates computational imaging and display concepts into several courses offered at Rice University and is developing a summer workshop on imaging to economically disadvantaged high school students and their teachers, thereby increasing K-12 STEM engagement. This research develops a signal processing framework for Computational Imaging (co-design of optics, sensors and algorithms), that is based on Gaussian Mixture Models. The model along with associated algorithms, will, for the first time, enable (a) fundamental performance bounds for existing CI systems, (b) make the design process systematic and develop novel CI systems, and (c) characterize and understand the regimes of operation for CI. The research team demonstrates the importance and utility of the framework, by creating order of magnitude performance improvements in three different application areas: (1) lens-free cameras: design, develop and demonstrate thin, lens-free cameras that consist of a  series of masks laid on top of a bare conventional sensor with associated algorithms for demultiplexing; (2) light-in-flight imaging: design, develop and demonstrate ultra-fast imaging using conventional time-of-flight sensors and appropriate illumination/sensor modulation and reconstruction techniques; and (3) high-res, long-range imaging: design, develop and demonstrate sub-diffraction imaging resolution at long ranges, using a camera array and phase retrieval based algorithms.

1183,"This project seeks to discover mechanisms that regulate movement of transposable elements, also known as  jumping genes .  Transposable elements are abundant DNA sequences found in all genomes, and their ability to move or copy themselves to new locations in the genome contributes to changes that can lead to new genetic traits. The focus of this research is the mPing element from rice, which belongs to a transposable element family that is broadly distributed in plants, animals, insects, and fungi.  Understanding how movement of mPing is controlled offers the potential to exploit these elements as tools for identifying genes associated with beneficial traits, such as high grain yield in cereal crops.  This project will have broad educational impacts relevant to workforce development by engaging a large number of undergraduate students through an inquiry-based biochemistry laboratory course that offers hands-on experience in genetics and protein chemistry.  The project will also involve students in the research laboratory, providing them with direct participation in all phases of the discovery process, from experimentation to presentation and publication of their findings.  This research will use both genetic and biochemical analyses to determine (1) how mPing regulates its own movement within the genome, (2) the factors that determine its insertion site preference, and (3) how mPing is replicated. This research builds on three previous observations, i.e., increased movement in hyperactive mPing mutants, preference for insertion into nearby genes, and the ability to increase in copy number over time. The mechanisms controlling transposition rate will be analyzed by determining the factors that regulate formation of the active transposition complex. This includes in vivo binding assays (yeast one-hybrid and yeast two-hybrid) to identify the nucleotides and amino acid residues responsible for interactions within the DNA-protein complex. The effects of mutations that modify transposition complex formation will be tested using a previously established yeast transposition assay. To determine if transposition timing is linked to cell cycle control, microscopy will be used to follow the dynamics of transposase protein localization during cell division. The mechanism of mPing insertion site selection will be investigated by determining how altering chromatin structure changes the insertion pattern. The role of homologous recombination repair in the replication of mPing will also be addressed by measuring mPing duplication in control and DNA repair mutants. Together, the results will define the critical self-regulatory mechanisms that control movement in this active transposable element and thereby will suggest what specific changes could be made to increase the utility of these elements as tools for genome engineering.This award was co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

1185,"Rice University will host two annual two-day workshops titled  Capacity Building for Competitive S-STEM Proposals  with the broad goal of improving the competitiveness of submissions to the National Science Foundation Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (NSF S-STEM) program from predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs), with emphasis on those located in states and jurisdictions that are part of the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program.  PUIs include associate's colleges, baccalaureate colleges, and master's colleges, as well as doctoral institutions that award a limited number of terminal degrees in STEM disciplines supported by NSF.  EPSCoR was established by NSF in 1978 to  stimulate competitive research in regions of the country that were less able to compete successfully for research funds.    A total of 120 invited participants will be supported to attend the two workshops, which will be held in 2017 and 2018.  Building on the team member requirements in the S-STEM solicitation, participants will apply to and participate in the workshop in pairs: principal investigators (PIs) and researchers (educational, social/behavioral, discipline-based educational, or institutional).  Workshop content will be delivered by a team of experienced S-STEM PIs, educational researchers, STEM faculty members, administrators, and practitioners.  Participants will engage in hands-on activities and receive real-time feedback as they develop sections of their proposals onsite.  Potential broader impacts of this activity include (1) increased geographical diversity of S-STEM awarded institutions; (2) enhanced institutional diversity among S-STEM awardees; and (3) more industry and academia partnerships, including partnerships among public and private as well as teaching and research institutions. Other anticipated outcomes of this project include an increase in the fraction of S-STEM awards made to institutions in EPSCoR states that are represented by workshop participants and those that qualify as PUIs (using the 2016 federal fiscal year as a baseline); and that participants will report improved perspectives, knowledge, and awareness of quality partnerships with industry and/or other institutions.  The research component of the project will advance knowledge on barriers to success specific to the targeted institutions, which will yield information NSF can use to strategically implement outreach efforts for S-STEM and other educational research programs and that PUIs can use to overcome those barriers.  It will also advance knowledge on the quality and extent of partnerships at the core of S-STEM projects and the degree to which partnership experiences enhance faculty development experiences.  Primary (e.g. participant application materials and surveys) and secondary (e.g. the NSF awards database) sources will be used to collect quantitative and qualitative data to inform both the research and evaluation components of the project.

1187,"Campus networks are required to protect information and inspect data flows to safeguard security and privacy. However, researchers need open and unfettered access to large data flows and instruments across the globe to reduce time to discovery.  The Rice University network is a shared resource that not only needs to support the administrative and teaching functions but also enable scientists to use that network in new and innovative ways for research.  Five key data-intensive application teams act as drivers of the new extension of network functionality and are providing feedback to the technical design staff.  These application areas include earth and atmospheric sciences; urban data science; computational biosciences and neuroengineering; particle physics and distributed cluster computing.  These applications build on long-term science investments aimed, amongst others, at understanding seismic events, the weather patterns in the Gulf regions and beyond, as well as urban trends in large, diverse cities such as Houston, TX. The basic model adopted by the project is  the science DMZ.  A Science DMZ is  a portion of the network, built at or near the campus local network perimeter designed so that equipment, configuration, and security policies are optimized for high-performance scientific applications rather than for general-purpose business systems.  This approach allows Rice to aggressively upgrade its network capacity for greatly enhanced science data access.

The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin, and occasionally other institutions in the region. It is intended for the participation of around 60 people, including 25 non-local graduate students. The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have an opportunity to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium consists of 7 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions (including a poster session) for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The Symposium is a forum for regional specialists in mathematical physics and related areas of analysis to become familiar with the latest problems and present their own results; in addition it introduces young mathematicians to the current state of the subject.This year's Symposium will focus on the areas where harmonic analysis, dynamical systems theory, spectral theory, and partial differential equations intersect and interact.

1189,"Over 10,000 species of grasses are known to science.  Grasses proliferated rapidly, obscuring their historical relationships.  This project integrates three broad approaches in a study of grass diversification using contemporary methods to reconstruct the genealogy of the grasses.  Next generation DNA sequencing methods will be used to determine complete chloroplast genomes and subregions of the nuclear genome from at least 100 species.  Bioinformatics analyses will explore patterns and rates of DNA sequence evolution.  Studies of development, especially in leaves, will be used to test whether particular adaptations are correlated with historical migrations into new habitats. Grasses are of fundamental economic and ecological importance.  Rice, wheat, maize and other cereals supply half of human dietary calories.  Wild grasses predominate over 25% of Earth's terrestrial landscape.  A better understanding of their relationships is fundamental to predicting the response of grasslands and cereal crops to environmental change.  Analyses of sequence data will clarify relationships and have broad application in evolutionary studies.  Ecological adaptations will be better understood when viewed in a developmental context.  An image-rich web site will be established, with content in English and Spanish, with information on grass structure, classification, and evolution.

1190,"The Phase II strategy is split into four phases. Phase 1 is the optimization of the bench-scale prototype board. During this period, an assessment trip will be coordinated to assess IDEA&rsquo;s current factory operations and conditions, search for rice straw and rice husk distributors, and conduct market research to further optimize the product. The team will continue to optimize the bench-scale prototype board to meet all desired properties. Phase 2 is the scale-up of the benchscale 9&Prime; &times; 9&Prime; board to a 4&prime; &times; 8&prime; board at a local facility. Materials, equipment, accreditation testing, machinery, and a facility will be purchased. Once the prototype board performs as desired with lab testing and is scaled up to a 4&prime; &times; 8&prime; board at a local facility, it will be sent to the Composite Panel Association and QAI Laboratories for official testing and accreditation.

1191," Objective(s): Objective 1: Characterize the influence of zinc and iron concentrations in edible crop tissues and crop species on the bioavailability of crop cadmium to animals (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 2: Characterize the potential transfer of soil lead, arsenic, and other trace elements by vegetable crops grown on element enriched urban and orchard soils and develop methods to prevent this transfer. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 3: Characterize genetic resources and inheritance of grain Cd to reduce cadmium in durum wheat, flax and soybean. (C1; PS 1.F). Objective 4: Evaluate information about the risk from Cd in foods to support public decisions for foods of both plant and animal origin. (C1; PS 1.F). The ultimate goals of this Project Plan are to improve the science about risk of heavy metals in soils and crops in order to obtain improved regulatory limits for Cd in crops under Codex, and the information needed to provide improved advice about the risk of Pb in urban garden soils and crops. Essentially all human Cd disease from soil Cd has resulted from paddy rice grown on fields contaminated by mining or smelter emissions. Garden vegetables and other grains have not been found to induce Cd disease in highly exposed populations who grow crops on highly Cd+Zn contaminated soils. Some Europeans want to set crop Cd limits based on attainable levels rather than on the basis of potential risk to consumers. Such non-risk based standards will harm U.S. growers of durum wheat, sunflower kernels, flax, soybean, and some other crops. If crops must contain lower levels of Cd to win importation by other nations, both soil treatments, selection of soil series which produce lower Cd crops, and improved cultivars which accumulate lower amounts of Cd will contribute to growers needs. Providing a clear technical basis for the bioavailability of Cd in different crops appears to be the central issue which could change the demand for lower limits for crop Cd, and protect growers from unnecessary costs to produce lower Cd crops which may have no benefit. Only animal feeding tests can provide valid information about the bioavailability of crop Cd to animals, and the concentrations fed must represent levels in foods rather than toxic levels fed in most previous research. Because Zn is usually greatly increased in crops (except rice) when Cd is increased, the presence of Zn may substantially reduce the bioavailability of crop Cd, alleviating presumed risk of crop Cd. Because commercial carrots were found with higher than normal Pb concentrations when grown on historic orchard soils, U.S.-FDA requested that ARS examine the basis for carrot Pb accumulation and to learn if agricultural amendments can reduce carrot Pb when they are grown on high Pb soils. Certain root crops have xylem elements growing through the edible storage root, so if Pb is trapped within the xylem during normal growth of the crop, it will be in the edible root. But such Pb might have much lower bioavailability than the Pb-acetate used to establish diet Pb risk; 2-10% of food Pb is absorbed, while 60-80% of soluble Pb in water is absorbed by human volunteers.

1198," Objective(s): Effective defense responses are essential for plants to protect themselves against pathogens. Despite much research, many determinants of host resistance and their roles in signaling remain unknown. Pseudomonas syringae, a plant pathogenic bacterium, causes disease in more than 150 plant species. ZAR1 is the R protein responsible for recognizing the acetyltransferase HopZ1a, a P. syringae type III secreted effector protein (T3SE). ZAR1 is found in many plant species, including the Solanaceae, castor bean, and rice. However ZAR1 defense signaling does not depend on any components previously implicated in plant resistance, including salicylic acid. Further investigation of ZAR1 signaling gives us a unique opportunity to identify novel genes involved in plant resistance and potential targets for improving plant immunity. This project plan will address three major questions:  1) What other genes are genetically implicated in resistance to HopZ1a? Preliminary data from a forward genetics screen has identified several mutants that lack HopZ1a-mediated defense responses (hopz-effector-triggered-immunity-deficient or zed). The proposed work will map these mutants and characterize their roles in resistance.   2) What is the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance? The proposed work will identify other proteins that contribute to ZAR1-mediated resistance.   3) Is ZAR1 resistance conserved in other plant species? The proposed work will examine ZAR1 resistance in wild and domesticated tomato. Using a multi-pronged approach, this work will identify and characterize new sources of resistance to protect plants from disease.  The specific objectives are: Objective 1:  Conduct genetic screens coupled with next-generation DNA sequencing to identify genes that contribute to pathogen resistance in plants.   Objective 2:  Characterize the mechanism of ZAR1-mediated resistance using molecular, genetic, and proteomic approaches.

1209,"﻿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Project Summary [With this application for PAR-14-227, the Construction Industry Research and Policy Center (CIRPC) at the University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK) seeks to undertake a project to improve occupational injury surveillance using existing workers' compensation (WC) data. We have assembled a multidisciplinary advisory team from medicine, public health, and the academic community and supplement our own resources with a consultant experienced with WC First Report of Injury (FROI) claims, and denominator employment data. With this collaboration we expect to gain insight for health improvements at the intersections of public and occupational health. The Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development (TDLWD) Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) maintains a database of 68 variables (see Appendix A) from 120,000 annual medical and indemnity claims as First Report of Injury (FROI) information. This data is has great potential to supplement existing data sources in occupational health surveillance. After eliminating personally identifiable information and other non-essential variables, we will collect three years of data for the enumeration of injury counts and subsequent calculation of injury rates based on industry and establishment size for the private sector. By linking this data with the state's Unemployment Insurance (UI) database through the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN), reliable data can be obtained on injury counts for NAICS industries and establishment size strata. Going further, we can use the NAICS linkage to determine industry employment through the use of databases such as the QCEW, CPS, and ACS. We will combine the state count data and publically accessible employment determinants to calculate injury rates and create prioritization indices as part of a final report document. This report can provide immediate returns by identifying focus areas for targeted intervention in critical industries (e.g.fall protection in construction) or injury prevention for common maladies across industries (e.g. musculoskeletal injuries). Longer term benefits are expected to result from a database containing the key industry, event, and illness/injury information. The database will enable subsequent research and inform industry educational efforts. Most importantly, we expect this project to be the impetus for destroying the silos currently existing between the various state agencies and the academic community within the state. ] Aberrant crypt foci; Address; Agriculture; Animal Model; Animals; Anti-inflammatory; Apoptosis; Area; Avena sativa; Award; Azoxymethane; Bifidobacterium; Blood; Cancer Cell Growth; cancer chemoprevention; Cancer stem cell; Cancer Survivor; Carcinogens; Cecum; Cell Survival; Cells; Cereals; Chemoprevention; Chemopreventive Agent; Clinical; Colon; colon cancer prevention; Colon Carcinoma; colon tumorigenesis; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal Cancer; Communities; comparative efficacy; Complex; Consumption; cytokine; Data; Diet; Dietary Component; differential expression; Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging; fecal microbiota; Feces; feeding; functional food; gamma-oryzanol; Germ-Free; Grain; Growth; gut microbiota; Gut Mucosa; Human; humanized mouse; Immune; Immune response; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Infiltrate; inflammatory marker; innovation; Investigation; Knowledge; Lipids; lymph nodes; Mediating; Mesentery; Metabolic; Metabolism; metabolomics; Microbe; microbial; microbiome; microbiota; Molecular Profiling; mouse model; Mucosal Immune Responses; Mucosal Immunity; Mus; Neoplasms; novel; Nutrient; Outcome; Phenols; Phenotype; Phytic Acid; Phytochemical; Plant Sources; Population; pre-clinical; Probiotics; Production; Property; Protein Isoforms; public health relevance; Regulator Genes; Rice; Role; Sampling; Signal Transduction Pathway; small molecule; Spleen; stool sample; Structure; Structure of aggregated lymphoid follicle of small intestine; Testing; Tissues; Tocopherols; Tocotrienols; Translations; Transplantation; tumor; tumor microenvironment; tumor progression; Validation; WheatUTILIZATION OF TENNESSEE WORKERS' COMPENSATION DATA FOR INJURY SURVEILLANCE AND PREVENTION",1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,0.999999,0.999999,0.999999,1e-06

1215,"The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program. Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.The sense of hearing is a critically important ability that enables an individual to relate to the external world. Loss of hearing affects an individual?s health, function, quality of life and mortality. Current estimates are that hearing loss results in excess medical costs ranging from $3.3 to $12.8B in the United States, and over $750B worldwide. A recent report from the National Academies highlighted the need to recognize hearing loss as a major public health concern. This planning grant brings together a diverse team of researchers from Rice University, Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Southern California and Oregon Health Science University. This team will have complementary expertise in auditory neuroscience, cochlear implants, speech perception and devices that connect directly to neurons. This team will engage in a series of meeting and activities that will lay the foundation for an Engineering Research Center in Auditory Bioengineering. The proposed Center will work to develop new technologies, expand the engineering workforce and foster a culture of diversity and inclusion by supporting the deaf and hard of hearing, especially members of underserved populations. At the scientific level, the engineering advances in technologies for precise electrical stimulation of neurons will be broadly applicable to devices such as retinal implants, auditory implants and deep brain stimulators. Recognizing the limitations of hearing aids and cochlear implants, the planning team will seek to revolutionize current hearing rehabilitative technology through transformative engineering enabled by a convergent approach involving several engineering disciplines. The major scientific goal will be to develop a next generation auditory implant that more intimately connects to spiral ganglion cells, more faithfully encodes sound, is smaller and easier to use, and is more economical. During the course of this grant, the planning team will critically evaluate the potential of recent technological advances to improve hearing health care and identify additional participants to perform center-scale research. This will be accomplished through a series of meetings held in in Houston, TX, Los Angeles, CA and Portland, OR. The team will engage stakeholders - including individuals with cochlear implants, hearing health care professionals, policy makers in hearing health care, and low-income individuals whose hearing health care needs are currently unmet. The team will used evidence-based strategies to recruit and develop the center leadership team. The team will also engage major cochlear implant manufacturers and identify other industrial partners.The intellectual focus of this proposal will reside in a critical evaluation of the potential for the following thrust areas to serve as a foundation for convergent research in Auditory Bioengineering. Thrust 1: Enabling Technologies for Next Generation Auditory Implants. In this thrust, recent advances in engineering technologies such as carbon nanofiber electrodes for neural interfacing will be integrated into biomedical microsystems to produce an innovative design for a next generation auditory implant. Thrust 2: Speech Perception for Auditory Bioengineering. In this thrust, recent advances the cognitive aspects of speech perception will be harnessed to determine the relevant information that needs to be passed to auditory implants and how best to provide that information based on what is known about the neural code, with consideration that different languages are tuned to different acoustic features. Thrust 3: Global Health and Disparities Research in Auditory Rehabilitation. This thrust will seek to investigate and evaluate ways to expand access to auditory rehabilitation with hearing aids and cochlear implants, especially for underserved population.The goal will be to develop an ERC in Auditory Bioengineering that will serve a national resource for auditory researchers, neuroengineers, audiologists and clinicians. With a central location in Houston, TX, the center will have national outreach and serve as a way to pool patient populations for studies on outcomes and disparities in auditory rehabilitation. This proposal will fill a key need in workforce development in training more students at the interface of hearing and speech research, who are prepared to employ modern engineering approaches for auditory rehabilitation.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

In this project the investigators plan to blend efficient hashing algorithms with Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra, which can overcome these computational barriers. The project will engage diverse graduate and undergraduate students in computer science, statistics, ECE, and applied mathematics both at UCB and Rice. The efforts of this project will also be utilized to push data science for social good, through collaborations with a human rights data analysis group in leveraging hashing algorithms to reduce human efforts in estimating the extent of war crimes. The results of the project will be made available to a wide audience through OpenStax CNX, which will to disseminate course materials free-of-charge to anyone in the world and thereby foster the growth of vibrant communities around the subject.This project will achieve two complementary goals: first, extend the foundations of RandNLA by tailoring randomization directly towards downstream end goals provided by the underlying problem, rather than intermediate matrix approximations goals; and second, use the statistical and optimization insights obtained from these downstream applications to transform and extend the foundations of RandNLA.

1218,"The project's objective is to develop the foundations for realizing denial of service (DoS)-resilience, secrecy, and high throughput in next-generation wireless networks in which base stations or access points (APs) scale their antenna and computing resources to massive multiple-input/multiple-output (massive MIMO). This project considers a practical yet strong adversary that launches both active attacks, attempting to collapse network throughput by polluting AP measurement of Channel State Information (CSI), as well as passive attacks, that attempt to intercept communication via potentially distributed and nomadic eavesdroppers. The first project thrust targets to detect and defend against pilot contamination attacks with zero startup cost, i.e., without requiring prior measurements of conditions without an attack. The second project thrust experimentally explores passive eavesdropping under realworld factors such as a large but finite number of antennas and a discrete and limited set of modulation and coding schemes (MCS). With a discovery of MCS saturation vulnerability, the project will study power control designed to overcome this vulnerability and thwart the adversary. On the uplink, the third project thrust develops antenna index coding as means to target reception on a subset of the massive MIMO array. A key outcome will be both derivation of the secrecy rate as well as experimental evaluation of this new mechanism. All three project thrusts will include an extensive experimental study using the Rice massive MIMO platform and over-the-air measurements. As computing and communication resources must be devoted to realizing the aforementioned counter mechanisms, this project will yield empirical understanding of the tradeoffs in realizing both high spectral efficiency and security.The proposed research agenda will enable new wireless security defenses and will provide an in-depth understanding of securing next generation communication systems such as massive MIMO. This project will yield new understanding of the design space that spans from traditional throughput optimization to jointly realizing security features and providing security by design. This project will yield new understanding of the security capabilities and limits of designs based on CSI as a shared secret. This project will impact standards bodies as it will expose fundamental limits of existing security mechanisms and will show how enhancements to standards can yield dramatically improved security capabilities. This project will impact industry through demonstration of results coupled with the researchers' extensive collaborative industry network. Finally, the project includes an inter-disciplinary methodology and the team includes multiple Ph.D. students from under-represented groups.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1223,"A major technological revolution is emerging as researchers develop the ability to interface natural and synthetic cellular systems with nanoscale materials to create hybrid cells and devices that communicate electronically. This new interdisciplinary field has the potential to transform fundamental science, industry, medicine, and our way of life. To achieve these innovations, industry will require a workforce that collaborates across disciplines to develop devices that enable measurement, manipulation, control and sensing of biological processes of organisms, cells, molecules and reactions. Because this industry will change how we interact with each other, this topic will present new policy, economic, and environmental issues to solve. The National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to William Marsh Rice University will address these challenges by training graduate doctoral students in the interdisciplinary field of bioelectronics. The project anticipates training thirty (30) doctoral students, including eighteen (18) funded trainees, from engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences doctoral programs. Students typically begin training in disciplinary graduate programs, and collaboration follows after investing significant time into defining the research problem, often through co-mentored apprenticeships. This educational model is thought to limit the kinds of questions that students pursue because students are not poised to effectively integrate into the type of teams required for bioelectronics innovation. To overcome these limitations, this NRT program will integrate a team-first pedagogical model for doctoral training with bioelectronics research to educate students about past interdisciplinary innovations, theoretical underpinnings of interdisciplinarity, creation of cohesive teams and community building, frameworks for achieving conceptual understanding across disciplines, and strategies to understand the needs of stakeholders. Research activities centered on bioelectronics themes encompass diverse topics, such as light-harvesting systems that enable chemical synthesis within cells, instruments that monitor complex electrical signaling in the nervous system, and living sensors that interface with handheld devices. This traineeship program will also provide training in effective communication, teaching and mentorship, conflict resolution, leadership and management, responsible conduct in research, and outreach. Students will work in interdisciplinary teams to identify bioelectronics questions, perform team-based research, and generate joint publications. Team integration will be achieved through catalysts, including the synthesis of proposals and articles, the creation of activities for educating others about interdisciplinarity, interdisciplinary workshops, peer-writing groups, cell/device fabrication and testing activities, and annual activities that refine interdisciplinary communication skills.The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1224,"The project will construct a wetlands research facility, the University of Houston (UH) Wetland Observatory for Wildlife/Water research (UH WOW), at the University of Houston's existing field station, the University of Houston Coastal Center (UHCC). No wetlands research facility currently exists in this geographic area. Investigators are forced to work in tanks, which are too small for many questions, or in natural ponds, which are limited in number, vary in size and allow only a limited range of experimental manipulations. The proposed facility will address this research need by allowing replicated experiments at a large scale, and will expand the research capabilities of the UHCC in a wide range of disciplines, including ecology, water quality and flood control. The proposed facility will allow easy customization and control of the water level in each wetland, enabling researchers to test hypotheses under controlled conditions in open wetland environments, and spurring fundamental advances in understanding ecology, hydrology, and water quality. The proposed experimental wetlands will provide a unique facility that will benefit researchers from a variety of institutions in the Houston area (including UH, UH Downtown, UH Clear Lake, Rice University, Texas A&M Galveston), within a 3 hour drive (Texas A&M, Baylor, UT Austin), and over a broader geographic area. The facility will also improve undergraduate and graduate education at universities in the Houston metropolitan area, including those that lack major research infrastructure, such as UH Sugar Land and the University of St. Thomas. Graduate and undergraduate students will have increased opportunities to participate in research at the facility. Classes taking field trips to the UHCC will be able to view the wetlands and discuss experimental science and the ecological importance of wetlands. On occasions when some wetlands are not in use for research, they will be available for sampling by student groups conducting field activities. The benefits of improved undergraduate and graduate education at the UHCC will be particularly important for under-represented minorities. UH is a Hispanic-Serving Institution and the second most ethnically diverse major research university in the United States, and UH Downtown also has a very diverse student body. The facility will also improve public education by providing new opportunities to discuss experimental research, flood control, and the value of wetlands with K-12 and other public groups visiting the UH Coastal Center.The project will consist of an array of wetlands at the University of Houston Coastal Center (http://www.uhcc.uh.edu/). The wetlands will be excavated ~1.6 m below the soil surface at a site dominated by non-native grass and trees. A membrane will line the bottom of the ponds, which will be back filled with some of the excavated soil. The remaining excavated dirt will be used to form berms around the wetland edges. The wetlands will be individually plumbed and controlled with remotely-operated valves, allowing easy filling, draining, and control of water level. Because the water level will be adjustable, each wetland can be filled or drained to function as a pond, wetland or wet grassland as needed for different research projects.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1225,"Non-technical DescriptionThe basic knowledge and understanding of how environmental stressors, such as high temperatures, affect cereal crop production is important for global food security. Rice, a model cereal plant and a major world staple crop, is grown in the southern United States, and is threatened by increased night temperatures that contribute to unstable production, resulting in lower grain yield and quality, which result in decreased market value. This project will identify individual rice lines that are tolerant to high nighttime temperatures and will use a variety of genetic and biochemical techniques to identify potential mechanisms that underlie the ability of these plants to be high temperature tolerant. These mechanisms will be tested in the plant using gene editing technologies to confirm that these mechanisms and thus the underling causative alleles are responsible for the plant's resistance to high nighttime temperatures. Knowing the actual mechanisms will aid breeders to develop new lines that can help decrease the risk of major crop losses due to high temperatures in the future. This project will be a collaborative effort among the University of Arkansas campuses at Fayetteville and Little Rock, Louisiana State University, and Oklahoma State University and will help develop the careers of six early career research faculty, train undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs. In addition, the projects will build educational resources for STEM at the undergraduate level as well as K-12. Technical descriptionThe japonica rice subspecies is the basis of most US varieties currently in production and have been used in US breeding efforts with other rice introductions from all over the world to select varieties that are tolerant to high night temperature. In this project, a diverse collection of rice lines critical to U.S. production will be screened in the field, including environments differing in night temperature, and replicated under controlled greenhouse conditions, to identify heat tolerant genotypes with contributing genes and novel mechanisms that are of interest to use in improvement of rice and other cereals for their resilience to high night temperatures. The genetic changes or identification of alleles ascribed to the desired phenotypes will be characterized at multi-systems levels: the transcriptome, metabolome, proteome, and the physiological response. Information from these analyses will be integrated into gene regulatory networks that can provide a biological understanding of plant adaptations to the changing environment documented in independent genotypes. Wildtype or mutant alleles identified from the population studies will be validated by transformation and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated allele engineering, followed by phenotypic validation to identify alleles associated with heat tolerance, as proof of concept for use in cultivar development. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) project brings together complementary expertise comprising senior and junior faculty from the University of Arkansas campuses at Fayetteville and Little Rock, Louisiana State University, and Oklahoma State University, to address this complex challenge in an interdisciplinary manner. The participants include six early career faculty from different institutions, who will be integrated into the interdisciplinary program to develop expertise in cross-disciplinary research projects. The project will include training of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, participation of 10-12th grade students in STEM girl's leadership events, and of High School teachers and students for training in Plant Genetics and Physiology.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1226,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is to cost-effective production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from agricultural residues such as wheat and rice straws, cornstovers and other non-food biomass items. HMF is a critical, versatile and renewable immediate that can be used to produce fuels and a variety of other products such as polymers including polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides and poly(ethylene-furanoate); binders, adhesives, coatings and foams, some of which have market size in the range of billion lb/yr. The worldwide HMF industrial production is 30 tons/year. It is not produced in any industrial scale because it is not yet an economic viable product. The proposed technology is designed to change that. The catalytic process proposed in this project will be significant avoiding the food-or-fuel dilemma. The solvent used in the process is green and environmental friendly. The polymeric solid acid catalyst is non-toxic and reusable. The project will also train skilled workers for the emerging biorefinary industry. The technology if successful and commercialized could benefit the state of Arkansas in effective utilization of crop residues. This project involves close collaboration with a minority and women-owned industrial partner for commercialization. The proposed project aims to develop cost effective production of HMF using a paradigm shift catalytic membrane reactor to hydrolyze agricultural residues including rice and wheat straws and directly dehydrate hydrolyzed sugars to HMF with high yield and selectivity. HMF will be simultaneously separated from the product stream using size-based customized membranes. One of the keys to success lies in optimizing the polymeric solid acid catalyst that is capable of catalyzing both hydrolysis and dehydration reactions efficiently. The catalytic activity is shown to be tunable by varying the chain length and chain density of the grafted polymers on substrates. The catalyst and its activity are found to be stable over repeated runs. This green technology replaces the currently used highly corrosive sulfuric acid and expensive cellulase enzymes for biomass hydrolysis, as well as becoming a promising catalyst to replace the toxic metal chloride for glucose dehydration to HMF. Another key to success is the design of a catalytic membrane reactor for simultaneous HMF production and separation leading to process intensification and significant cost reduction. The ultimate goal of this project is to convert lignocellulosic biomass to HMF with high yield and high selectivity in an economical and environmental friendly manner.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1227,"An award is made to Clemson University to support the acquisition of a soil greenhouse gas flux measurement system. This system will fill needs for rapid, accurate, in-situ measures of important greenhouse gas concentrations and fluxes. The instrument measures concentrations and soil efflux of water vapor, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and the especially potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. Based at Clemson University's Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science, the system will be deployed in field experiments designed to elucidate the role of sea level rise on coastal wetland ecosystem functioning and potential for feedbacks to climate. It also will be deployed at agricultural research stations across South Carolina to augment research on air and water pollution, fertilizer loss, and sustainable agriculture. This system will allow researchers to generate datasets and science with greatly improved accuracy, applicability, and scalability. The system will be used in projects that include undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers across a diverse team of researchers including women, first-generation college graduates, and underrepresented minorities in science. The instrument will also be used in new graduate classes that cover wetland ecology, coastal ecology, and biogeochemistry.Methane and nitrous oxide are powerful greenhouse gases that exert a significant radiative forcing on Earth's climate. Wetlands and agricultural systems are major sources globally, but the mechanisms driving their sources, sinks, and sensitivity to environmental drivers are poorly understood. This gap can be attributed largely to the difficulty in measuring these trace gases at the very low concentrations at which they occur in the environment and by barriers to sampling without artifacts. The acquisition of this soil gas flux measurement system will overcome these obstacles by providing excellent sensitivity and time resolution in a field deployable configuration. An array of multiplexed, automated soil flux chambers will allow for replicate measures of treatments in situ, thus enhancing statistical rigor and the strength of conclusions. Initial use of the system will be to augment ongoing, funded projects that assess the effects of saltwater intrusion on coastal forested wetlands, the rates and types of nitrogen losses from agricultural systems, the effects of restoring impounded wetlands and old rice fields on greenhouse gas emissions, and life cycle analysis of switchgrass production for biofuels. Data and analyses from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and used in both educational and public outreach activities.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1228,"Volcanic eruptions pose one of the principal hazards at tectonically active continental margins, such as the Pacific northwestern United States, which are of ever increasing economic and existential importance to expanding populations. The project will enhance knowledge of the conditions that lead to eruptions of silica-rich magmas, which can be large and impactful. Achieving this goal is contingent upon the integration of observations through reliable physics-based models that have been tested in their predictive capabilities. This is the project's principal focus and it will advance understanding of the fundamental processes that determine the progression of volcanic eruptions, from inception to cessation, which remains difficult to forecast. Consequently, the project transcends the purely academic and is societally relevant by advancing natural hazard assessment capabilities. Furthermore, the project supports education by enabling the interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoctoral scholar, thus contributing to the development of a diverse and globally competitive workforce.The project's objective is to advance fundamental knowledge of how volcanoes work by simulating a volcanic eruption from initial explosive activity through lava effusion, to termination of the eruption and post-eruptive inflation, using the 2011/12 Cordon Caulle eruption in Chile as a case study. For this eruption the run-up, the syn-eruptive evolution, and the post-eruptive reconfiguration of the volcanic system were documented in unprecedented detail. The eruption was initially explosive and over time eruption rates decreased with activity shifting from purely explosive to effusive, resulting in the formation of a large lava flow and shallow laccolith. The current view about these types of eruptions is that over some range of identical conditions effusive or explosive activity is possible and with potentially rapid transitions from one to the other. One goal of the project is the assessment of conditions resulting in transitions in eruptive activity in order to test this explosive-effusive bistability hypothesis. Moreover, rapid post-eruptive inflation was observed and a further goal is to assess the extent to which the system has been driven back toward a critical state. These goals will be achieved by integrating the different observational data within extensive physics-based model simulations that will lead to improvements in model reliability and further our understanding of underlying processes at Cordon Caulle and similar hazardous volcanic systems elsewhere. The project as such is multi-disciplinary and encompasses geochemistry, petrology and geodesy, in addition to numerical simulation of magma storage and eruption. As a consequence, the project is also multi-institutional and in addition to existing observations, new data will be acquired through efforts led by the other collaborating institutions. The portion of the project that Rice University will focus on - in collaboration with the other institutions - are the numerical simulation and the integration of the different types of observational data.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1229,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARYThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education on how collagen and fiber networks more generally respond to mechanical deformation. In animals, most soft tissues such as skin, tendon and organs depend on networks of collagen that impart mechanical stability to the full tissue. Similar networks of fibrinogen also form as part of the wound healing process. A common feature in the mechanical response of such natural biopolymer materials is that they become stronger, with increased mechanical stiffness as they are deformed. This self-stabilizing mechanical response is still not well understood and it has been difficult to achieve in man-made soft materials, such as rubber or other synthetic polymer-based materials. This project is aimed to develop a fundamental theoretical model and understanding of the mechanics of collagen and related biopolymer-based materials. This will be based on the fundamental physics of phase transitions or changes of state, much like the change of state of water to form solid ice as it is cooled. The PI and colleagues have recently demonstrated that collagen networks undergo a similar mechanical phase change as they are deformed rather than cooled. A fundamental understanding of the origins of the mechanical response of collagen and related fiber-based materials can be the basis for the rational design of synthetic materials with similar properties. This project can also form the theoretical basis for control and design of the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube foams and aerogels, which have recently emerged as a promising class of very light and soft conductors. The research in this project will be the basis for training of graduate students working at the interface between physics and chemical engineering, with application perspectives in tissue engineering and materials science. The research will also impact the teaching of mechanics of materials to undergraduates and graduate students working in chemical and biomolecular engineering, chemistry, physics and materials science at Rice University.TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis award supports theoretical and computational research on the mechanics and rheology of athermal fiber networks. Polymers naturally range from highly flexible or freely jointed chains to idealized rigid rods, with a broad class of semiflexible polymers in between that are often described as wormlike chains. The so-called persistence length, which characterizes the scale over which polymers appear straight in the presence of thermal fluctuations, is often used to distinguish these regimes. Among the most rigid of polymers are biopolymers that play important structural and mechanical roles from the single cell level to the whole tissue level of extracellular matrices. The principal component of extracellular matrices is usually collagen, consisting of thick protein fibers with effectively infinite persistence length and negligible thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, collagen fibers are not rigid rods and bending plays an important role in the mechanical response of collagen networks. The challenge of understanding such networks has recently brought renewed interest to the mechanics and rheology of athermal fiber networks. A new approach to fiber networks has recently been proposed, drawing on the notion of athermal, mechanical phase transitions and associated critical phenomena. This was motivated in part by classic work on network stability going back to Maxwell's isostatic constraint counting arguments, as well as more recent developments in jamming of particles. Importantly, however, the isostatic threshold cannot account for the mechanics of real fiber networks in 3D, since these lie below the Maxwell point for central-force or spring-like interactions: bending must be included. The PI's group recently identified theoretically signatures of critical phenomena in subisostatic networks as a function of strain, which have now been confirmed experimentally in collagen networks. This project aims to (1) develop and test computationally scaling theories for mechanical phase transitions in fiber networks; (2) predict and test phase behavior and rheological signatures of strain-controlled phase transitions; (3) develop models of composite fiber networks, with both fluid and soft gel matrices; (4) develop computational models for carbon nanotube gels.This approach based on mechanical phase transitions and especially strain-controlled critical phenomena represent a novel approach to polymer rheology. This research will deepen our understanding of a class of mechanical phase behavior that should be of significant interest within condensed matter and materials science, while establishing fiber networks as new model systems in which to study critical phenomena using rheology.The study of composite networks should significantly advance the quantitative understanding of collagen extracellular matrices, for which a consensus theoretical model has been lacking. This project can also form the theoretical basis for control and design of the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube foams and aerogels, which have recently emerged as a class of very light and soft conductors. The research in this project will be the basis for training of graduate students working at the interface between physics and chemical engineering, with application perspectives in tissue engineering and materials science. The research will also impact the teaching of rheology to undergraduates and graduate students working in chemical and biomolecular engineering, chemistry, physics and materials science at Rice University.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1230,"Professor Robert B. Weisman of William Marsh Rice University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry to develop new methods to control and manipulate the optical and chemical properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes using laser light sources of specific wavelengths. Carbon nanotubes are an exciting class of nanomaterials that are technologically important for their unique physical and chemical properties and their many potential real-world applications, including uses in energy, health care, and the environment. Current carbon nanotube preparation methods result in mixtures with many structural forms and properties. Separation and sorting of these mixed components are often needed to obtain samples suitable for specific applications. The project selectively alters the surface chemistry of targeted nanotube species to allow them to be physically separated with greater ease and scalability than is currently possible. The aim is to generate samples with tailored optical properties and compositions, enabling advanced and deeper understanding of carbon nanotube reactions, interactions with light, and potential practical applications. In addition to training students in the advanced spectroscopy and analytical chemistry of nanomaterials, high school teachers and a professional visual artist are involved in the project. The teachers are hosted in the laboratory to conduct summer research, thereby gaining knowledge and perspective to enrich their teaching. The artist is incorporating fluorescent carbon nanotubes into his artwork to engage and educate the public about nanotechnology.In this project, optical transitions at short-wave infrared wavelengths are used as a tool to control the composition of single-wall carbon nanotube mixtures. Samples containing nanotubes of many different diameters and chiralities are irradiated with lasers at specific short-wave infrared wavelengths chosen to selectively excite the S11 transitions of targeted nanotubes within the sample. In the presence of appropriate reactants, those excited nanotubes become chemically functionalized. The resulting selectively functionalized nanotube structures exhibit altered physico-chemical properties and suppressed fluorescence yields. In this way, targeted portions of the sample's emission spectrum are  carved out  to generate customized spectral profiles suited for use in basic research and applications development. Subsequent processing of the sample using methods such as aqueous two-phase partitioning or controlled centrifugation isolates the functionalized targeted structure from the rest of the sample. The isolated fraction is then defunctionalized using thermal and chemical methods to recover the physically separated structure in its pristine form. The ultimate goal is to generate structurally sorted carbon nanotube samples with tailored optical properties and compositions. These are investigated to arrive at a deeper understanding of carbon nanotube spectroscopy, photo-processes, and reactions.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1231,"Plant steroid hormones called Brassinosteroids (BRs) signal to regulate plant growth, development and response environmental stresses. However, our understanding of how this steroid hormone controls thousands of genes to regulate these processes is incomplete. The project will generate and use multiple large-scale datasets to model how genes are controlled to govern BR-regulated growth and drought responses. BR pathways are well conserved among Arabidopsis and crop plants such as maize, rice and other crops, so the knowledge obtained from the proposed studies can be used to design strategies to optimize plant growth and crop production under drought conditions. Moreover, the project provides excellent training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral associates in modern plant biology. The investigators will also achieve societally relevant outcomes by providing training opportunities to underrepresented undergraduates through the George Washington Carver Internship program as well as engaging high school and community college teachers via summer internships. Through this partnership with teachers a learning module on BR-regulation of plant growth will be developed for high-school and community college students. Furthermore, unpublished data from the proposed studies will be incorporated into an upper level undergraduate course on functional genomics, systems, and network biology, freeing students to generate their own hypotheses during a group project rather than simply reproducing published work. Finally, the investigators will provide resources to the research community by organizing a workshop on plant phenomics, proteomics and computational modeling approaches and by making the data generated publicly accessible through publications and the Principal Investigator's laboratory website.Molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis have greatly advanced our understanding of the BR signaling pathway. BRs signal to regulate BES1/BZR1 family transcription factors (TFs), hundreds of BR-Related Transcription Factors (BR-TFs) and thousands of target genes. Although numerous BR-TFs have been identified, the transcriptional complexes that allow BES1/BZR1 and these BR-TFs to regulate the large number of BR-responsive genes have not been characterized. In addition, modeling of BR networks has proven to be a powerful approach to understand how BES1 directs a network controlling thousands of BR responsive genes. However, previously constructed BR networks have only considered transcription, overlooking important regulation at the post-transcriptional and post-translational level. The project will use an integrated genetics, genomics, and proteomics approach to establish and experimentally test a comprehensive Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) governing BR-regulated growth and drought responses. By combining cutting-edge proteomics with advanced predictive modeling the project will generate a comprehensive view of BR-mediated transcriptional regulation and allow for the identification of novel factors involved in BR responses. First, investigators will uncover the components and functions of BR transcription factor complexes by examining the role of two novel BR-TFs. These two BR-TFs interact with BES1, a master regulator of the BR pathway, as well as a large number of other BR-TFs, likely forming large transcriptional complexes to control the expression of BR target genes. Second, investigators will generate BR transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome datasets that are a prerequisite for a novel approach pioneered by the Co-Principal Investigator to construct GRNs based on these combined omics data. These combined networks have increased predictive ability compared to networks based only on transcriptional data and will provide a vital resource, allowing for a more complete understanding of the transcriptional program through which BRs control plant growth and stress responses.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

To ensure that transplant centers are effectively using these scarce organs, this award will develop new transplant center evaluation criteria to incentivize transplant centers to improve their post-transplant outcomes and maximize transplantation volume. This award will lead to a deeper understanding of current pay-for-performance initiatives in the transplantation system and in other healthcare settings by examining the interplay between societal goals and provider incentives. The goals of this award are in line with the NSF mission goal of promoting the advancement of the national health. This award will fund a doctoral student in inter-disciplinary research and create educational materials for both operations researchers and transplantation professionals at the Texas Medical Center. This award will involve students from underrepresented groups and engage in outreach efforts through various programs at Rice University and the University of Houston.This research will build a bilevel optimization framework to model the interaction between the societal perspective and the goals of individual transplant centers to determine incentives that simultaneously maximize societal and center-level benefits. This framework (1) formulates the societal perspective (the leader) that quantifies the utility-adjusted, national benefit and determines societally optimal incentive parameters, and (2) models each transplant center's perspective (the followers) as a sequential, stochastic decision-making problem so as to maximize its transplant volume subject to the societal incentives. Bilevel models are considered among the hardest optimization models. This research will lead to advances in bilevel optimization where the followers' problems are sequential and stochastic. To address the computational challenges, the researchers will develop approximation techniques leveraging the fluid model structure of each center's problem and chance-constrained programming techniques, and build efficient algorithms based on decomposition, branch-and-cut methods, and high-performance computing.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1235,"Altering gene regulation, also known as transcriptional reprogramming, is at the heart of plant development, reproduction, and responses to various stresses. Simultaneously reprogramming multiple, specific genes is desirable for studying gene function and expression, dissecting complex signaling networks, engineering metabolic pathways, and building synthetic switches and circuits. However, genetic tools that would allow biologists to turn multiple genes on and off in this way in plant cells are currently unavailable. This project develops these tools and will not only aid basic research in plant science, but also allow plant scientists to seek novel solutions to global challenges such as devastating plant diseases, economical bioenergy production, sustainable agriculture and response to climate change. This project applies recent technical advances in CRISPR plant genome engineering to build essential comprehensive genome reprogramming tools and demonstrate them in rice, an important crop. The specific aims of this project are to develop 1) an efficient multiplexed transcriptional activation system; 2) an efficient multiplexed transcriptional repression system; 3) a bidirectional multiplexed transcriptional regulation system; and 4) a CRISPR design tool within the software of the Integrated Genome Browser for transcriptional regulation in plants. The highly efficient plant transcriptional reprogramming systems and the design tool developed in this project will benefit the plant research community in advancing basic research and crop improvement. These easy-to-use, effective tool packages will be tested for sophisticated multigene, transcriptional reprogramming and made available to researchers at the public repository, Addgene. In addition, the project will provide cutting-edge training to a diverse group of students at various levels, including a postdoctoral scientist, two PhD students, and many undergraduate and high school students from diverse backgrounds.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1236,"This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Rebecca Povilus is  Identifying Deeply Conserved Patterns of Epigenetic Modification and Imprinting during Seed Development . The host institution for the fellowship is the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mary Gehring.Seeds are important for humans; seeds make up most of our diets and are a key part of the ecosystems that we depend on. Understanding what factors influence seed development is necessary to improve seed crops (such as wheat, corn, rice, and soybean), as well as to ensure the production of viable offspring when re-introducing genetic diversity into inbred crop varieties. Only recently have technologies and systems been available to elucidate the role that epigenetic modifications (chemical changes to DNA bases and to associated DNA-packaging proteins) play during plant reproduction. While epigenetic modifications have been shown to be important for seed development in a small number of distantly related plant species, the actual patterns and effects of epigenetic modification appear to vary substantially between species. To predict how broadly epigenome-based technologies for crop improvement and plant breeding can be applied, the patterns of epigenetic modifications that are fundamental to all flowering plants, or are specific to particular lineages must be determined. This project will provide an otherwise lacking foundation for understanding how the role that epigenetic processes play during reproduction has evolved across flowering plants. To do so, epigenetic modifications and their association with gene expression during seed development will be identified in the emerging model system Nymphaea thermarum, a member of one of the most ancient flowering plant lineages. Training objectives include genomics, epigenomics and bioinformatics. Broader impacts include outreach to local school teachers through the Whitehead Partner program and the development and distribution of a module for early-science education that explores the importance of biodiversity and basic research to agriculture and food security. This module will be presented as part of the Arnold Arboretum Summer Institute, and will be available at https://nthermarum.weebly.com/.The goal of this project is to understand epigenetic modification and its impact on gene expression during seed development. Specific objectives include 1) determining the dynamics of epigenetic modification during reproductive development in N. thermarum through immunolocalization of methylated DNA and histone marks, methylation-sensitive DNA sequencing and chromatin profiling and 2) identifying genes that are maternally- or paternally-imprinted during early embryo and endosperm development using hybrid crosses and tissue specific gene expression analysis. By comparing results from Nymphaea to information from model species, deeply conserved patterns of epigenetic modifications and imprinted gene expression will be distinguished from those that are derived within either monocots (such cereal crops) or eudicots (such as Arabidopsis). Results of this project will be published on open-access pre-print servers and peer-reviewed journals, and information will be available on the website https://nthermarum.weebly.com/.Keywords: seed development, embryo, endosperm, epigenetics, Nymphaea, comparative genomics and epigenomicsThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1237,"This award supports participation in an international symposium at Rice University in Houston, Texas, held June 25-29, 2018, entitled  A Symposium on Optimal Stopping.  The symposium is designed both to bring participants to the frontiers of research in the mathematical theory of optimal stopping as well as to stimulate further research. The event aims to encourage young U.S. researchers to pursue research in optimal stopping and offers the opportunity to more senior researchers to consolidate their experiences and to form fresh research collaborations. In addition, the meeting will develop future avenues for research that should benefit researchers working in the fields of: mathematical and numerical analysis (partial differential equations, partial integro-differential equations, boundary value problems, free boundary problems); financial and insurance mathematics (particularly exotic option pricing in semimartingale markets and credit risk); statistics (particularly sequential testing, quickest detection, and optimal prediction); and physics (particularly two-phase problems including obstacle problems and problems of melting and solidification).The symposium encompasses six themes: 1) The connection between optimal stopping problems and free-boundary problems in mathematical physics; 2) Methods of solution for optimal stopping problems, in particular nonlinear methods; 3) Applications of optimal stopping to American type options, credit risk, and game theory; 4) Applications of optimal stopping to sequential testing, quickest detection, regularity problems, detection of hidden targets, and optimal prediction; 5) Nonlinear and constrained optimal stopping; and 6) Connections of optimal stopping to stochastic control and to statistical inference for stochastic processes.

1238,"The plant growth hormone gibberellin (GA) plays a key role in seed germination, leaf expansion, stem elongation and flower and fruit development. Altered GA production or responses in cereal crops, e.g., the dwarf cultivars of wheat and rice, greatly increased the grain yields during the  Green Revolution  in the 1960s-1970s. These examples illustrate the importance of this hormone in regulating plant development and in agriculture. GA-promoted plant development is modulated by DELLA proteins, which are master growth repressors that integrate multiple cellular pathways in response to environmental cues (such as light conditions, pathogens, cold and drought stresses). Although DELLA plays such a central role in regulating diverse plant growth processes, very little is known about how DELLA controls multiple pathways and how DELLA activity is dynamically regulated. This project will focus on these two important aspects and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. This research will facilitate more effective strategies to manipulate plant growth and stress responses for agricultural improvements since DELLAs are highly conserved in plants. This research project will also have a broad impact in training young scientists, including a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student and four undergraduate students.Recent studies indicate that DELLAs function as central regulators of multiple signaling pathways by direct protein-protein interactions with key transcription factors (TFs). DELLAs do not contain a DNA-binding domain, and are likely to repress expression of target genes by sequestering their interacting TFs. DELLAs can also activate transcription by binding to specific TFs. However, the molecular mechanism of how DELLAs regulate target chromatin and gene expression remains unclear. Preliminary results from the principal investigator's laboratory showed that two missense mutations in a specific subdomain of RGA (an Arabidopsis thaliana DELLA) did not affect interaction with TFs. Instead, they were impaired in binding histone and an epigenetic regulator. These results raise an exciting possibility that histone binding may enhance DELLA association with the target chromatin, and DELLA may recruit epigenetic regulators to induce chromatin structural changes. This working model will be tested in Specific Aim 1. The roles of different subdomains in RGA will be defined by analyzing the effects of additional missense rga alleles on binding to TFs, histone, and epigenetic regulators using yeast two-hybrid and pulldown assays, and association with target chromatin by ChIP-qPCR. DELLA activity needs to be strictly modulated in response to internal and external cues, and it is known that GA induces DELLA degradation. Recent studies also indicated that DELLA activity is dynamically modulated by post-translational modifications. Preliminary data indicate that DELLA phosphorylation is altered under GA-deficient conditions, although the role of this modification remains unclear. Specific Aim 2 will identify phosphosites in RGA by MS analysis, and characterize functions of potential protein kinases for these modifications by genetic and biochemical analyses. This research project will shed new light on the molecular mechanism of how DELLAs regulate target chromatin and gene expression, and elucidate the role of phosphorylation in fine-tuning DELLA activity.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1239,"Advances in nanotechnology have been central to the creation of novel biomedical applications, energy transport and storage systems, aerospace materials, and solar energy conversion. This research explores novel nanostructures made of boron nitride (BN). Graphene is one type of nanocarbon in which a honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms forms a thin sheet. When graphene is seamlessly rolled, it forms carbon nanotubes, a well-known material. Alternating boron and nitrogen atoms can replace carbon in carbon nanotubes to form BN nanostructures, BN nanostructures are wide band gap semiconductors with outstanding thermal stability, in contrast to their carbon analogs. Concentrating on these special differences, Professors Angel Marti and Matteo Pasquali of Rice University, are exploring how to tune the properties of BN nanostructures by attaching chemical groups to their surfaces and by monitoring their movements in solution. This information may enable the assembly of these nanostructures into sophisticated systems with tailored physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. This research may accelerate discovery and innovation in producing insulating films, corrosion protections, and UV optoelectronics. Professors Marti and Pasquali disseminate their research to the greater community through press releases and YouTube videos. They provide cutting-edge nanoscience activities such as workshops, talks, and summer research opportunities by reaching out to high school, college, and graduate students, paying particular attention to underrepresented groups. The research team recruits and mentors undergraduate students from Puerto Rico via the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program. LSAMP facilitates the training of underrepresented students in cutting-edge nanoscience research. Supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of NSF's Chemistry Division, Professors Marti and Pasquali are addressing fundamental challenges of BN nanostructures such as surface functionalization, exfoliation, dispersion, and imaging. BN nanostructures are functionalized with a variety of groups by virtue of organic radicals produced under Billups-Birch conditions (lithium in liquid ammonia). The properties of these functionalized structures are studied in different environments and solvents. Furthermore, the dispersibility of BN materials are studied in surfactants having different charges and polarities to understand the conditions that lead to their dispersion in aqueous solution. Dispersed structures are studied by fluorescence microscopy, using special fluorescent surfactants, to understand the dynamics of the BN nanotubes in solution. Overcoming these challenges advances fundamental knowledge of the chemistry and properties of one- and two-dimensional BN nanostructures.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1240,"This project will investigate the lifecycle and functions of a class of small RNAs that support pollen development in grass flowers, specifically in anthers. The experiments focus on the biogenesis, precise localization, and quantification of these 24-nucleotide RNAs, the proteins that utilize them for anther functions, and their role in plant fertility. Prior work demonstrated that these small RNAs are required for robust male fertility under even slight temperature stress: without them anther development fails. The project will focus on maize anthers because it is easy to determine accurately what developmental stage they are in, they are easy to dissect, there are numerous developmental mutants that affect anthers for which the gene has been isolated, and because understanding male fertility is important to the production of hybrid corn seed. A more detailed understanding of the molecular basis of pollen development enables improvements in seed production, including hybrid seeds; in the grasses, hybrid corn and rice have significantly boosted world food production. Outcomes of this project could include discovering new genetic pathways for more precise control of male fertility in plants, and plants with fertility that is more resilient to environmental change. The project will utilize plant genomics and targeted mutagenesis, cutting-edge imaging techniques, bioinformatics, with a focus on developmental biology. Broader impacts of the project include training of students in plant and computational biology via continued integration with long-running and successful undergraduate and high school internship programs. The project will focus specifically on the class of 24-nt phased, secondary siRNAs, known as  24-nt phasiRNAs  that are highly enriched in meiotic-stage anthers. The work will be done in maize as the primary species for analysis because there are significant, existing genetic and molecular resources. The project will address several important questions. Do meiotic cells differ from somatic cells in the accumulation of small RNAs and their functions? Which transcription factors guide the transitions required for setting cell fate and differentiation of cell type-specific properties that include phasiRNAs? How are meiotic-stage small RNAs deployed to guide anther cell fate and differentiation? Where and when do the microRNA triggers, precursor mRNAs, and biogenesis or effector proteins accumulate? The project will characterize phenotypes and molecular genetic analysis of loss-of-function knock-out mutations that impact phasiRNAs, including mutations of the Dicer-like5 (Dcl5) gene, for which preliminary data demonstrate male sterility. Project members will be trained broadly in plant small RNA biology and genomics, cell biology and microscopy, and computational methods through their individual and group projects in the analysis of the localization, biogenesis, and biochemistry of small RNAs.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1241,"This research uses cultivated potato, which is the world's third largest food crop after wheat and rice. While most crops grow from true seeds, potatoes are vegetatively propagated and multiplied for several years in the field. Without proper management, disease incidence in potato can rise to devastating levels within a few years. PVX and PVY are significant viruses that gravely impact potato yield and marketability, and economically impact producers. The global spread of necrotic PVY strains has created new challenges for producers. There is an urgent need to advance the knowledge of genes in potato responding to virus disease. The overarching, long- term goal is to improve potato resistance to PVX and PVY infection. This research will uncover the mechanisms of how plants can respond to virus stress and adapt to challenging environments. This research will investigate a key set of stress response genes that protect plants against drought and virus infection. This research will also explore how a set of proteins known as BiPs suppress disease and determine how these can be used to provide protection against virus infection. We will use this information to improve potato production strategies and effective breeding practices. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central hub for responses to adverse environmental challenges in plants such as virus infection, heat, chemical, osmotic, and salt stress. The physiological consequences of prolonged low-level ER stress include constrained plant development and productivity, whereas chronic stress can result in death and crop losses. Three well known monitoring/sensing pathway use the transcription factors bZIP60, bZIP28 and/or bZIP17 to activate cellular adaptive responses. They coordinate the transcription of molecular chaperones, including the ER lumen binding protein (BiP). It is well known that Arabidopsis plants overexpressing certain BiP isoforms display greater tolerance to virus infections and heat and osmotic stresses. The central hypothesis motivating the project is that bZIP60, bZIP28, and bZIP17 differentially up-regulate expression of BiP isoforms that ameliorates ER stress and cell death regulation in solanaceous plants, such as potato and tobacco. The research team will test a model in which ER stress sensors and BiP isoforms are engaged in N. benthamiana and potato to provide cellular protection against virus infection.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1242,"A magnetar is a neutron star, or extremely dense star, which possesses an extraordinarily large magnetic field. Magnetars, of which around 30 have been discovered, are some of the most intriguing compact objects in the Universe. A research program, which is a collaboration between William Marsh Rice University, Hope College and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, will lead to the development of state of the art theoretical models for the atmospheric emission of magnetars. The prime objective is to deliver a suite of observable signal predictions to enhance interpretation of data from X-ray telescopes, leading to a better understanding of neutron stars, magnetism and fundamental quantum physics. Computer simulations will be developed for the propagation of X-rays through magnetar atmospheres with arbitrary magnetic field orientations, including all locations on the neutron star surface, from magnetic pole to equator. The research includes significant graduate and undergraduate training. A PhD student at Rice University will be integral to the work, with the results leading to a doctoral thesis. Several undergraduates will work on self-contained portions of the research and present their discoveries to senior scientists and peers. The investigators will elucidate aspects of this work, and highlights of the exciting field of neutron stars, to the general public.Magnetars present a unique forum for testing fundamental physics that is not presently accessible in terrestrial laboratories. Better understanding of magnetars is central to using them as a proxy quantum electrodynamics (QED) physics laboratory. The researchers will help enable this by developing a comprehensive theoretical study of the emission from magnetar atmospheres, computing expectations for the polarization- dependent and angle-dependent emissivities at any position on the surface. The generation of polarization signatures will allow discrimination between the geometrical source information and the signatures of strong-field QED physics, like birefringent vacuum polarization. The work will feature upgrades of photospheric cyclotron absorption line physics and photon propagation, providing new tools for astrophysicists to employ in other neutron star problems. The results of this program will enhance potential science yields from polarimetric telescopes in the X-ray band. Four outstanding questions pertaining to magnetars will be significantly impacted by the research. These are (i) are magnetars inherently different from normal pulsars?, (ii) does the magnetic inclination angle of the rotator evolve with magnetar age, and can we measure it so as to more precisely calibrate the stellar field strength?, (iii) where, relative to the magnetic pole, is the site of heating in the surface that seeds quasi- thermal radiation in magnetars?, and (iv) can we use general relativity to determine the mass-to-radius ratio for magnetars, and thereby probe their equations of state?This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. absorption; Age; Atmosphere; atmospheric modeling; Award; Collaborations; college; Computer Simulation; Cyclotrons; Data Analyses; Development; Discrimination; Doctor of Philosophy; Equation; Evaluation; expectation; Foundations; General Population; Generations; Heating; Laboratories; Location; magnetic field; Magnetism; Measures; Mission; Names; Neutrons; peer; Photons; Physics; Positioning Attribute; programs; Proxy; Pulsar; quantum; Radial; Radiation; Research; Research Personnel; Rice; Roentgen Rays; Science; Seeds; Senior Scientist; Signal Transduction; Site; Source; Space Flight; Students; Surface; Testing; Theoretical model; Theoretical Studies; tool; Training; undergraduate student; United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Universities; Vacuum; WorkCOLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: RUI: THEORETICAL STUDIES OF THE ATMOSPHERES OF HIGHLY MAGNETIZED NEUTRON STARS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
1243,"With climate change threatening global food security, this team will use its expertise in technology development, plant gene regulation and genomics to provide essential tools to make crops better able to withstand environmental stresses. Patterns of gene expression that dictate plant responses to the environment and changes during development are directed by DNA sequences called transcriptional enhancers. In plants, fewer than 20 plant enhancers have ever been characterized yet understanding them is crucial for crop engineering and breeding. Using novel, genome-scale technology, this team will discover large numbers of transcriptional enhancers in the cereal crops maize, sorghum, rice and wheat, particularly those driving gene expression in response to heat and cold stress. The team will then compare heat- or cold-specific enhancers among these species and among different varieties of each species, determine what differences among them are associated with differences in plant performance under heat and cold stress, and identify the protein factors that bind to these enhancers to influence gene expression. After validating the function of these enhancer sequences in heat and cold tolerance, beneficial natural variants of them will be identified for crop improvement efforts. In addition, the team will introduce mutations into these candidates to try and improve them and carry out massively parallel functional assays of enhancer fragments to develop a toolkit of synthetic enhancers with defined strengths and specificities for future crop engineering. This project broadly impacts plant research, crop engineering and breeding; it also impacts the education of future plant genome scholars through targeted outreach efforts, including summer research internships for undergraduate students.This project will apply a novel combination of ATAC- and STARR-seq to discover large numbers of regulatory elements that actively drive transcription in maize and sorghum. Limited studies in rice and wheat will allow for species-level comparisons. The team will focus on transcriptional enhancers, in particular enhancers that drive gene regulation in response to heat and cold stress. With enhancer sequences in hand, the team will characterize condition-specific enhancers that are conserved or diverged between maize and sorghum, determine phenotype-associated enhancer variation, and identify the transcription factors binding these enhancers through motif searches. In-depth comparisons of sorghum and maize enhancers will yield insights into genome evolution after genome duplication in addition to insights into sorghum's greater stress tolerance. The team will also carry out mutagenesis and massively parallel functional assays of enhancer fragments in order to computationally derive synthetic enhancers of defined strength and specificity for crop engineering. Securing food supplies through crop engineering holds immense public interest and the pursuit of this goal enables this team to effectively reach out to diverse groups and students. The outreach program, a distributed network of undergraduate plant genomics scholars, builds on the success of existing programs at partner sites by providing additional funding for four students. Participants will be able to join the program for a second year at another site to acquire new skills and to experience a different research environment.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Computer simulations will be developed for the propagation of X-rays through magnetar atmospheres with arbitrary magnetic field orientations, including all locations on the neutron star surface, from magnetic pole to equator. The research includes significant graduate and undergraduate training. A PhD student at Rice University will be integral to the work, with the results leading to a doctoral thesis. Several undergraduates will work on self-contained portions of the research and present their discoveries to senior scientists and peers. The investigators will elucidate aspects of this work, and highlights of the exciting field of neutron stars, to the general public.Magnetars present a unique forum for testing fundamental physics that is not presently accessible in terrestrial laboratories. Better understanding of magnetars is central to using them as a proxy quantum electrodynamics (QED) physics laboratory. The researchers will help enable this by developing a comprehensive theoretical study of the emission from magnetar atmospheres, computing expectations for the polarization- dependent and angle-dependent emissivities at any position on the surface. The generation of polarization signatures will allow discrimination between the geometrical source information and the signatures of strong-field QED physics, like birefringent vacuum polarization. The work will feature upgrades of photospheric cyclotron absorption line physics and photon propagation, providing new tools for astrophysicists to employ in other neutron star problems. The results of this program will enhance potential science yields from polarimetric telescopes in the X-ray band. Four outstanding questions pertaining to magnetars will be significantly impacted by the research. These are (i) are magnetars inherently different from normal pulsars?, (ii) does the magnetic inclination angle of the rotator evolve with magnetar age, and can we measure it so as to more precisely calibrate the stellar field strength?, (iii) where, relative to the magnetic pole, is the site of heating in the surface that seeds quasi- thermal radiation in magnetars?, and (iv) can we use general relativity to determine the mass-to-radius ratio for magnetars, and thereby probe their equations of state?This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. absorption; Age; Atmosphere; atmospheric modeling; Award; Collaborations; college; Computer Simulation; Cyclotrons; Data Analyses; Development; Discrimination; Doctor of Philosophy; Equation; Evaluation; expectation; Foundations; General Population; Generations; Heating; Laboratories; Location; magnetic field; Magnetism; Measures; Mission; Names; Neutrons; peer; Photons; Physics; Positioning Attribute; programs; Proxy; Pulsar; quantum; Radial; Radiation; Research; Research Personnel; Rice; Roentgen Rays; Science; Seeds; Senior Scientist; Signal Transduction; Site; Source; Space Flight; Students; Surface; Testing; Theoretical model; Theoretical Studies; tool; Training; undergraduate student; United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Universities; Vacuum; WorkCOLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: THEORETICAL STUDIES OF THE ATMOSPHERES OF HIGHLY MAGNETIZED NEUTRON STARS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06
1245,"Sulfur is an ever-present component of living matter. As aquatic organisms grow, die, and decay, sulfur is exchanged between the organisms and their environment, cycling between its organic forms in living cells and inorganic forms in ambient water. An important process in the geochemistry of sulfur is sulfate reduction. This process, carried out in the environment by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen, converts sulfate, the oxidized and commonly available form of inorganic sulfur, into hydrogen sulfide, which is highly reactive and generally toxic to other organisms. This process has multiple environmental significances: it regulates the fluxes of important nutrients such as phosphorus and pollutants such as mercury; it is a pathway by which significant amounts of organic carbon are converted into carbon dioxide and low molecular weight carboxylic acids; and it affects the life cycles of commercially important aquatic plants such as wild rice. Over geological time scales, it is responsible for the formation of iron sulfides, which are preserved in sedimentary rocks and contain the record of environmental conditions dating back to the earliest stages of Earth's history. Present understanding of sulfate reduction, however, has been largely shaped by studies in marine settings where sulfate is abundant and easily available to organisms from seawater. The situation is different in freshwater lakes, rivers, and other low-sulfate environments, which include the oceans of distant geologic past and sediments deep below seafloor. Organic sulfur appears to be a much more important source of sulfur for sulfate reduction in these low-sulfate environments, however the pathways by which it circulates and the magnitude of its effects in different conditions are unknown. A team of geochemists, organic chemists, and geomicrobiologists from the University of Minnesota Duluth will address these questions by studying the sulfur transformations and relevant microorganisms, focusing on Lake Superior and its largest American tributary as the study area. They will collect sediments, analyze them for geochemically relevant sulfur species, measure reaction rates between these different species, and perform genetic analyses to identify key involved microbes. If the initial hypotheses are confirmed, the results are likely to transform the current paradigm of sulfur chemistry in such low-sulfate environments, influencing several scientific disciplines and providing a foundation for better environmental management practices. The project will support two beginning investigators and will train two graduate and several undergraduate students. Research cruises will provide no-cost support for several collaborative efforts on Lake Superior. Results, models, and methods will be incorporated into an innovative Limnology curriculum being developed by the PIs with NSF support. Findings will be communicated to public through a series of talks, K-12 teacher education events including a teacher education cruise on Lake Superior aboard the R/V Blue Heron broadcasted on YouTube, and exhibitions at Duluth Freshwater Aquarium. Microbially mediated sulfate reduction in aquatic sediments mineralizes organic carbon, generates hydrogen sulfide, and mediates the geochemical cycles of other elements, such as iron, phosphorus, and mercury. While organic matter contains a number of sulfur compounds, little is known of the fate of this organic sulfur pool during mineralization and more importantly its contribution to the inorganic sulfur cycle that fuels sulfate reduction. The current paradigm of sulfate reduction involves diffusion of sulfur from overlying water into the sediments where sulfur-reducing microorganisms are present. Contrary to the paradigm, modeling and preliminary results demonstrate that under low-sulfate conditions organic sulfur buried in sediment may be the dominant source of sulfur for sulfate reduction, and once mobilized, via microbial biotransformation, may be exported to the overlying water column. Contributions from organic sulfur may be pervasive in environments such as oligotrophic freshwater lakes or the oceans of the geologic past. By characterizing the organic sulfur transformations in sediments across a range of sulfate and organic carbon levels in Lake Superior and its largest American tributary, investigators will address the following questions under a range of environmental conditions: A. To what extent does organic sulfur contribute to the pool of sulfur that fuels sulfate reduction? B. Does organic sulfur undergo cryptic, microbially-mediated biogeochemical transformations, and what microorganisms are responsible for these transformations? They have assembled a multidisciplinary research team that combines expertise in sediment geochemistry, organic geochemistry, and geomicrobiology to address these objectives using sediment characterizations, rate measurements, molecular characterizations of microbial communities, and modeling. The results will quantify an important part of the diagenetic sulfur cycle that has received little attention despite its potential significance in environments such as freshwater lakes, deep subsurface, and the low sulfate oceans of the geological past. Verifying the proposed hypotheses may lead to reevaluation of the geochemical cycles of sulfur and associated elements such as iron and nitrogen, including cryptic reactions in the sulfate-methane transition zone; reinterpretation of the origins of the isotopic signatures of sulfur preserved in both modern aquatic sediments and ancient sedimentary rocks; and conservation and management practices in sulfide affected water bodies. The project will generate novel microbial and geochemical data that will be publicly available.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1246,"The aim of this Research Training Group project  RTG: Building Communities in the Mathematical Sciences at Rice University  is to continue, enhance, broaden and diversify the core ideas and values that were articulated by its founder Edgar Odell Lovett; namely that it be a,  school of the highest grade looking, in its educational programme, as much to investigation as to instruction.  In the context of the Mathematics Department, and more precisely, this Research Training Group project, the Principal Investigators (who have a broad expertise in Geometry and its connections with Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, and Algebraic Number Theory) together with other faculty members, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students intend to focus on building communities which will impact, at all stages of the academic pipeline, the number and readiness of people entering the U.S. mathematical workforce (both academic and industrial), and bolstering in particular the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in the mathematical sciences. Moreover, structures put in place will see a vertical community of women mathematicians, a vertical community of mathematicians from low-income households and underrepresented minority groups, a community of young scholars who will pursue research careers in industry, and a horizontal community of strong junior and senior math majors.The RTG Senior Faculty will use their research expertise and previous experience to mentor research of junior mathematicians centered on Geometry. Reflecting the strongly collaborative relationship of the team, contributions will come from perspectives not only within but also across the disciplines of Analysis and PDE, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Number Theory. To that end, vertical integration of postdocs and students will allow collaborative research projects, and this will be aided by developing an expository writing seminar in the mathematical sciences for freshmen as an alternative entry point into mathematical thinking, as well as organize conferences of RTG programs to share ideas, the highlights of which will be stored in a public written record. The log-cabin conferences and undergraduate conferences will give participants the opportunity to disseminate their research and grow collaborative networks. There will be opportunities for summer internships in local industries.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1247,"This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Yixian Wang from California State University Los Angeles and colleagues Jamil Momand, Edith Porter, Jing Zhao, as well as Fangyuan Tian from California State University Long Beach have acquired a surface plasmon resonance microscope (SPRM). This microscope can be used to study, for example, how proteins bind to the membrane of a single cell. The microscope operates by shining a light source at a sensor chip or metal plate. The light interacts with the metal plate to excite electrons and modify the light which is reflected to a detector. This is the so-called surface plasmon signal. When a sample to be studied is added, the surface plasmon signal is changed and data such as the interaction of a protein with a cell membrane can be evaluated. This technique can also be used to study how nanomaterials interact with cancer cells. It can shed light on drug delivery systems. Other applications range from environmental science to food quality and safety. The instrument is used by undergraduates and graduate student in their research projects providing training in future careers in chemical and biological analysis. This is the first SPRM instrument in the Los Angeles area. The award of this surface plasmon resonance microscope is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially aids studies of protein binding kinetics studies at multiple and single cell membranes and the search for real-time interaction between antimicrobial effector molecules and bacterial surfaces. The microscope is essential for the exploration of medicine delivery on iron-containing metal-organic framework thin films and for engineering nanomaterials interaction and uptake in cells. It also helps investigators in the determination of real-time electrochemical, redox active species release from cells and protein arrays during exocytosis and in rice protein arrays.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. antimicrobial; Area; Award; Binding Proteins; Biological; California; cancer cell; career; Cell membrane; Cells; Chemicals; Chemistry; Data; detector; Drug Delivery Systems; Ecology; Education; Electrons; Engineering; Evaluation; Exocytosis; Film; food quality; Food Safety; Foundations; Future; graduate student; instrument; instrumentation; Interdisciplinary Study; Iron; Kinetics; Light; Los Angeles; Medicine; Membrane; Metals; Microscope; Microscopy; Mission; Names; nanomaterials; Oxidation-Reduction; professor; programs; Protein Array; Proteins; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Rice; Sampling; sensor; Signal Transduction; Source; Surface; Surface Plasmon Resonance; System; Techniques; Thinness; Time; Training; undergraduate student; Universities; uptakeMRI: ACQUISITION OF A SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE MICROSCOPY SYSTEM FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND RESEARCH TRAINING",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,0.999999,1e-06,1e-06
1248,"In the past 15 years, measurements from the fields of geodesy and seismology have revealed that large faults along the boundaries of tectonic plates regularly slip at rates slower than earthquakes, but faster than the tectonic plates. These intermediate-rate slip events influence earthquake hazards through their potential to cause an earthquake on an adjacent segment of the fault or to control how big a future earthquake may become. Although the cause of these slip events is still debated, they are consistently observed in regions where the fluids filling pores in the rock are thought to be at very high pressure. Motivated by previous and preliminary laboratory observations that faulting becomes slower and more stable with increasing pore fluid pressure, scientists at Rice University are quantifying the effects of fluid pressure on the physics of faulting. This study is designed to provide inputs into models of regional seismic hazards, including along the San Andreas Fault and in Cascadia, where these slip events have been observed. This research is supporting the development of a laboratory by an early career researcher and the education of one graduate student and several undergraduate students. The researcher and students will incorporate this work into lectures and teaching activities on natural hazards.This research quantifies an experimental observation that is not explained by current models for faulting and, given the abundance of evidence for elevated fluid pressures in fault zones, has direct implications for the cause and characteristics of slow slip. Specifically, previous experimental observations show that the slip weakening distance and fracture energy of faulting increase with fluid pressure. Physical models for fluid pressure stabilization through a process known as dilatant hardening cannot predict the magnitude of this effect or the apparent monotonic decrease in failure rates with increasing fluid pressure. The purpose of this work is to (1) determine the processes that cause stabilization and (2) develop constitutive relations that include the effect of fluid pressure, which can then be incorporated into models of faulting. To this end, researcher and a graduate student are using experimental rock deformation to quantify the slip weakening distance and fracture energy of faulting as a function of pore fluid pressure magnitude and effective stress magnitude.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1249,"Dr. Justin Hayles has been awarded a postdoctoral fellowship to work with at Rice University and Pennsylvania State University to study oceanic oxygen isotope compositions of seawater throughout Earth history. The ocean is the most important reservoir of oxygen on Earth's surface. Its isotopic composition varies with ice volume and is influenced by interactions with the solid Earth on million-year timescales. Marine minerals record these variations: they inherit the oceans' oxygen-isotope composition. Marine mineral systems, however, show long-term secular variations that are not easily explained by changes in temperature or ocean isotopic composition exclusively. The ocean is thought to be buffered by high- and low-temperature interactions between seawater and seafloor rocks. If these interactions do not vary on billion-year timescales, the oxygen-isotope compositions of marine sedimentary rocks mostly relate to changes in seawater temperature and global ice volume. However, if these interactions do vary there could be a secular change in the oxygen isotope composition of seawater toward heavier compositions. By measuring the triple-oxygen isotope composition of ancient chert samples, it will be possible to constrain oceanic oxygen isotope compositions and ultimately advance our understanding of the surface environment throughout Earth history. The PI will work with undergraduates on research projects and provide outreach to local schools through career day events.Recent experimental results have demonstrated that silica, precipitated under most common Earth surface conditions, forms with a predictable temperature dependent offset in oxygen isotope composition from the water which its oxygen was ultimately derived. In practice, the oxygen fractionation based geothermometer system depends on the assumption of the oxygen of the water. By constraining this relationship, it is possible to fully constrain the oxygen isotopes and temperature which the silica formed from. However, because marine cherts are nearly ubiquitously diagenetically altered it is necessary to determine what effects, if any, there will be on the determination of seawater oxygen using this method. The effects of diagenetic alteration of marine cherts will be done through the characterization and triple oxygen isotope analysis of silica phases from the Miocene to Pliocene Monterey and Sisquoc formations of Southern California where three phases of silica (Opal-A, Opal-CT and microquartz) are known to exist.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1250,"Plants perform photosynthesis to transform carbon dioxide and sunlight into stored chemical energy - carbohydrates - that the rest of life relies upon. Photosynthesis works well when plants are not exposed to environmental stress, but when plants are too hot, or drought stressed, this process becomes inefficient. Plants have evolved two main alternative photosynthetic pathways in response to environmental stresses, CAM and C4 photosynthesis. C4 and CAM have each evolved many times, and it has been thought that C4 evolved in response to hot temperatures and CAM in response to drought. Similarly, these two pathways were assumed to be incompatible at cellular and genetic levels. However, a C4-CAM plant has been discovered: Portulaca, which performs C4 photosynthesis normally, but performs CAM under drought. This project aims to understand the function and ecological significance of a C4-CAM photosynthetic system. The research team will discover how many times C4-CAM evolved in Portulaca, and will identify the spatial configuration of both pathways within the leaf. They will identify the genes that regulate both pathways, and will compare the ecological ranges of C4-CAM species with relatives that do not have this trait. Finally, they will survey other plants to identify additional origins of this novel photosynthesis type. This research may contribute to crop improvement- for example, efforts to engineer C4 into rice, and CAM into poplar. A C4-CAM crop could be highly productive when water is prevalent, but drought-resistant when water is scarce. In addition, this award will support a broad range of educational activities, including post-doctoral and graduate student training, undergraduate research, and high school teacher training and curriculum development.C4 and CAM photosynthesis are two metabolic pathways that have evolved multiple times. Though biochemically similar, each pathway requires a unique suite of anatomical characters in order to work efficiently, and conventional wisdom holds that these characters are antagonistic, such that anatomy that facilitates efficient C4 will simultaneously disadvantage a CAM metabolism. This widely accepted view cannot, however, accommodate Portulaca, the only plants currently known to operate both C4 and CAM cycles within a single leaf. Recent work suggests that ancestral Portulaca was a facultative CAM plant, and evolved a C4 system while maintaining CAM capability at least three times. The proposed research will test this hypothesis and develop Portulaca as a model lineage for investigating the evolutionary connectivity of C4 and CAM pathways. This project aims to: 1) confirm the existence of facultative CAM in all major Portulaca lineages, and characterize CAM and C4 biochemical cycles and differential gene expression in 7 species representing all C4 origins; 2) identify the spatial configuration of C4 and CAM cycles within the leaf, using in situ hybridization and protein immunolocalization; 3) utilize recently designed targeted gene enrichment baits (HybSeq) to sequence key photosynthetic (and other) genes from across Portulaca to improve phylogenetic resolution and analyze convergent molecular adaptation across the group; 4) characterize and contrast the climatic envelopes occupied by C4-CAM Portulaca and C3-CAM related lineages; and 5) initiate phylogenetically-informed physiological surveys to discover additional C4-CAM plants in other clades.This award was co-funded in the Biology Directorate of NSF by Integrative Ecological Physiology in the Integrative Organismal Systems Division, Systematics and Biodiversity Science in the Division of Environmental Biology, and Emerging Frontiers.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1251,"This project will further the development of exact and asymptotic distribution theory for Gaussian processes and their quadratic forms. While modern advances in data science owe much progress to computational methods and the rapid growth in computer technology, statistics and applied probability are rife with examples where a careful mathematical analysis allows discoveries that no amount of computational power can uncover. This project is one such example and will use the PI's work on Yule's so called  nonsense  correlation, a 90-year old open problem that was solved last year via mathematical analysis tools. This explicit calculation showed the precise scale of the apparent correlation between two independent continuous series of data, such as what one encounters in economics, climate science, finance, and many other fields. This mathematical explanation of an apparent statistical paradox will enable the investigation of other important questions in mathematical statistics. The project will investigate a possible connection between some important open questions and a set of tools in probability theory whose power mathematical statisticians have only begun to investigate. The project will provide fertile ground for statistics graduate student training at Rice and Michigan State Universities; students will benefit from a wide scope of opportunities, from rigorous study of mathematical tools, to their use in statistics, to applications in fields of great societal value.This project will investigate the probability law of the Pearson correlation between two independent or dependent Gaussian processes. Analyses of distributions in the second Wiener chaos (quadratic forms of normals) are a new set of tools that will be brought to bear. Those tools are flexible enough to handle any Gaussian process via their so-called Karhunen-Loeve expansions. In terms of applications, what is most striking is that any statistical estimation or test based on these projected studies would only require a single or a pair of observations; this is particularly useful for situations, such as in environmental statistics or in economics, where experiments cannot be designed, and one has to work with the available observable data collected dynamically in time. The second emphasis in this study, on Polya frequency functions and related densities, uses some of the same mathematical tools, thanks to a realization that the densities can be represented and expanded explicitly in the second Wiener chaos. The project seeks to prove when a density is strongly log-concave (e.g. its logarithm has a second derivative which is bounded away from zero.) This question, which in mathematical statistics is phrased more broadly in terms of Polya frequency functions, has distribution of sums of independent and non-identically distributed exponentials, expands to the case of general second-chaos distributions. The project could have important consequences in the practice of statistics, especially in areas where comparing non-trivial time series is a challenge, and in many scientific fields informed by properties of log-concavity and strong log-concavity.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1252,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Landes at Rice University is working to understand and optimize processes that occur within porous materials. The goal of the project is to develop a new type of microscope with unprecedented space and time resolution. The Landes group's new microscope allows the study of how rare events impact the efficiency of porous materials that are important for catalysis, separations science, corrosion, and biology. It has been established that it is possible to manipulate light as it interacts with molecules and proteins. For example, Professor Landes has already shown that by shaping light's phase, events faster than the camera frame rate can be imaged. By incorporating new mathematical and physical tools, the current project will result in a new instrument to image and track fast dynamics in porous materials with optimized 3-D space and time resolution. The interdisciplinary nature of this research effort provides participating students with a unique experience at the interface of spectroscopy and materials science, as well as image processing and modern information theory, and continues the strong history of cross-disciplinary activities in science and technology at Rice University. This grant supports Professor Landes to provide training opportunities to high school teachers to incorporate cutting edge science into their course materials, as well as her new effort to create a summer scientific programming course. Recently, a new microscopy technique called super temporal-resolved microscopy (STREM) was developed. Proof-of-concept measurements showed that STREM can improve the time resolution of traditional wide-field cameras by at least twenty times. This development, if combined with recent advances in 3-D imaging methods and signal processing, represents an opportunity to resolve the multiscale, nonlinear dynamics that drive a range of interfacial materials properties. Thus, the current project's objective is to develop and optimize 4-D STREM, a chemical imaging method for quantifying the nonlinear dynamics and structures in porous materials. It is hypothesized that better 3-D sub-diffraction spatial information, coupled with improved time resolution and signal processing algorithms, reveals heterogeneous mass transport, chemical, and biological mechanisms occurring at porous interfaces. The project will involve innovations in both hardware and software to improve the temporal and 2-D spatial resolution. Additionally, a new algorithm is to be developed to track in 3-D. Finally, the new microscope is to be used to acquire and curate a machine learning library capable of differentiating among common analyte, sample, and instrument conditions. A new instrument optimized for characterizing the multiscalar physics and chemistry that underlie separations in porous media, by improving both spatial and temporal resolution is obtained in this project. Further, the project will result in new algorithms to extract information from large 3-D data sets. In terms of applications, a more detailed description of mass transport in pores and channels is a step towards predictive separations, which are currently optimized empirically, amounting to billions of dollars each year for industry, government, and academic purposes.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. 3-Dimensional; Algorithms; Award; Biological; Biology; Catalysis; Chemicals; Chemistry; Computer software; Corrosion; Coupled; Data Set; Development; Device or Instrument Development; Evaluation; Event; experience; Foundations; Goals; Government; Grant; High School Faculty; Image; image processing; imaging modality; imaging program; improved; Industry; Information Theory; innovation; instrument; interfacial; learning materials; Libraries; Light; Machine Learning; materials science; Mathematics; Measurement; Microscope; Microscopy; Mission; Modernization; Names; Nature; Nonlinear Dynamics; Physics; process optimization; professor; Property; Proteins; Recording of previous events; Research; Resolution; Rice; S Phase; Sampling; Science; Shapes; signal processing; Spectrum Analysis; Structure; Students; Techniques; Technology; temporal measurement; Three-Dimensional Imaging; Time; tool; training opportunity; UniversitiesINSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT: 4-D SUPER TIME RESOLVED MICROSCOPY (4-D STREM) FOR UNDERSTANDING DYNAMICS IN POROUS MATERIALS",0.999999,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,1e-06,8.186006449772637e-06,1e-06

To date the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 58 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington.By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and early career researchers. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select junior faculty at these institutions.The permanent web page for the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~tgtc/archive/.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Q-Bio  stands for Quantitative Biology and reflects the Summer School's goal to combine biological and mathematical methods to understanding the evolution and function of biological cells in health and disease. Individual cells respond to stimuli such as viruses in different ( noisy ) ways, but their interaction is a coordinated immune response which can be predicted using mathematics. Another example is the effect of chemotherapy on leukemias, which may leave small numbers of residual malignant cells and lead to recurrence of disease. Again, it is possible to predict, using mathematics and computer simulations, how and when this may happen. The q-bio School encourages early career scientists to pursue quantitative systems biology and provides a forum for the exchange of new results and ideas. The unique formula of the School includes active participation in research projects, some of which lead to scientific progress and publications. The Summer School originated in 2007 on the campus of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and past summer schools have been very successful, with over 85% positive reviews and 76% former participants actively engaged in quantitative biology research. The current School at Rice University campus takes advantage of the Houston Health Center, the Baylor College of Medicine and MD Anderson Cancer Center. The School will be followed by the Annual q-bio Conference at Rice University. Over 11 years the q-bio Summer School has developed an extensive network of 4-500 alumni and actively promotes participant diversity.Two educational tracks are envisioned in 2018: Cancer Dynamics and Stochastic Cell Regulation. The program will last two weeks and include: ten 1-hour research seminars; ten 1.5-hour general lectures; 30 hours of in-depth breakout discussions, chalk talks and computer lab demonstrations; 8 career-focused panel discussions; 20 student oral presentations; two poster sessions; 20+ hours of mentored project work; and formal and informal networking opportunities. The Stochastic Cell Regulation track explores stochasticity and cell-to-cell variability in the measurement and modeling of biochemical systems, concentrating on how small numbers of important molecules (i.e. genes, RNA, and protein) affect dynamics of living cells. The Cancer Dynamics track addresses biological and mathematical issues related to modeling of evolution of cancer. Lectures cover topics spanning many time- and length-scales, from fundamental issues of cell proliferation and mutation dynamics to molecular events affecting specific pathways in cells and population genetics effects. This section of the summer school includes instructor-suggested group projects, in which students formulate and explore stochastic models of cancer evolution, applying these tools to model experimental and clinical data.

1255,"Post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced approximately 3 million U.S. veterans, a population expected to nearly double in the next three years. Between 780,000-900,000 of these veterans have sought medical care connected to their military service, and roughly 25% have a documented service-connected disability. Amid ongoing concerns about institutional inadequacies and the relentless problem of veteran suicide, public policy and popular attention have been turning to veteran's family members as a key resource to help those encumbered by service-connected debility. Care for these veterans is generally thought of as spread across two disparate yet occasionally overlapping spheres: medical institutions, such as the VA, and veteran families. Policy, legislation, and other efforts to support veterans are overwhelmingly targeted at these two spheres, and while much of the help injured veterans need is indeed provided by either clinicians or family members, among post-9/11 veterans 23% of those providing informal everyday care are friends and neighbors, a uniquely high percentage compared to previous generations of veterans and civilian populations alike. Current research offers a partial picture of the effects of caregiving in military and veteran families, and this has led to important policy initiatives such as Joining Forces and the VA family caregiver support program. However, virtually nothing is known about informal veteran caregiving beyond the family, and non-family caregivers are not supported by VA or other programs. Furthermore, the exclusive focus on family - particularly wives - as the source of informal care can lead to negative social and health outcomes including caregiver burnout for family caregivers and narrowed life options for veterans. While roughly 20% of Americans are disabled, and many disability communities have developed innovative models for sustaining long-term informal care outside of the family, injured veterans are not usually considered part of broader disability communities. As a CAREER project, the project implements a range of educational activities aimed at improving the public's understanding of disability and veterans issues. This includes a free public online course, and resources that will be available on a public website.To help create conversations and linkages between veteran and non-veteran disability communities, the project includes the creation of a free online disability studies course designed specifically for veterans, as well as a workshop that will bring together members from both veteran and non-veteran communities to discuss shared experiences and strategies and to create community caregiving resources which will be made publically available through an accessible website. The project also provides training for undergraduate and graduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.With the support of a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, Dr. Zoe Wool of Rice University will explore the ways in which socialities of care for disabled veterans are improvised within, beyond, and against kinship and other existent infrastructures of care. This project combines long term ethnographic data collection, semi-structured interviews, and social network analysis to understand and map the full range of caregiving relationships that emerge around injured post-9/11 veterans. The research will be conducted in Houston, TX, and at an innovative new intentional community for injured veterans in New Orleans, LA. The project also aims to understand the way family and non-family caregiving relationships may interact with each other and may be shaped by caregiving--and expectations around family relationships, in similar or different ways. In addition, the project looks to non-veteran disability communities in California and New York, which each have a rich history of experiments in social arrangements of informal caregiving, including the relatively recent model of care collectives. In addition to understanding the kinds of relationships people count on for care, the project investigates the duration and temporality of these relationships, with a special focus on the ways various caregiving relationships are shaped by the need for improvisation that often accompanies life lived with chronic illness or impairment. The project will advance anthropological and broader social scientific theories of sociality, care, disability, and kinship. Bringing the worlds of injured veterans together with the worlds of broader disability communities practiced in developing alternative caregiving networks may lead to new ways of thinking about informal long-term care and the policies that support it, both for veterans, and for the millions of other disabled Americans.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1256,"CREST Center for Sustainable Lightweight MaterialsThe Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the enhancement of research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. CREST promotes the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. With CREST program support, Tuskegee University will continue development of its Center for Sustainable Lightweight Materials in collaboration with Auburn University, Cornell University and National Laboratory partners. This work will accelerate research and development of multiscale advanced lightweight materials with potential applications in areas such as automotive, building, biomedical and tissue engineering, among others, where synthetic materials are found to be toxic, non-degradable and non-sustainable. The Center articulates three research thrusts: (1) Nanobiomaterials Extraction, (2) Biopolymers Design and Synthesis, and (3) Advanced Green Composites. The aim of all three research thrusts is to gain fundamental understanding of the emerging field of sustainable lightweight advanced materials. Activities in Subproject 1 include synthesis of a variety of nanomaterials from waste resources like rice husk, bone ash, and fish scales, extraction of cellulose in various forms and lignin from plants, and production of nanofibers. Subproject 2 includes synthesis of biopolymers from lignocellulosic biomass, development of resins with excellent thermal and mechanical properties from agricultural and food processing wastes. Subproject 3 activities focus on development of advanced green composites through use of plant fibers, fibers from liquid crystalline and bacterial cellulose. In addition, durability and toughening characteristics of advanced composites will be enhanced through development of autonomously self-healing polymers and composites, toughened fibers and resins. The Center will enhance STEM research and education at Tuskegee University, produce new knowledge, strengthen the research competitiveness of faculty and promote interdisciplinary collaborations within Tuskegee University and with partner research centers. Center activities will enhance the research and development enterprise and infrastructure at Tuskegee University, making it nationally competitive in the emerging field of sustainable lightweight advanced materials. Intellectual property will lead to the creation of patentable products and processes.Students, traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, will be provided with meaningful research experiences at a readily accessible advanced research facility and a pathway to Ph.D. programs. Center activities will provide education and research integration and exposure to students from middle school to the doctoral level, and to the general public, including persons with disabilities.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1257,"This project creates a city-scale platform for advanced wireless research that will be deployed over the period 2018 - 2023 in Salt Lake City, Utah. This Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven Experimental Research (POWDER) supports at-scale experimentation of novel advanced wireless broadband and communication technologies in the sub-6 GHz band. The project features interactions with regional networks encompassing initiatives on public transportation, broadband delivery, education and health service delivery as well as advancement of science, technology and research by creating an ecosystem of a hundred small companies in allied technical domains. The ability to use this platform by early adopter companies/startups and application developers to evaluate technologies in their pre-commercial phase will have a significant positive impact on the speed of innovation in the data networking and application domains. This effort will also benefit educators and students at all levels of study in communications-related disciplines. A key feature of the platform is the partnership with the Reconfigurable Eco-system for Next-generation End-to-end Wireless (RENEW) project at Rice University to develop a highly programmable and flexible massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) platform that is an essential feature of both 5G and beyond-5G wireless networks. The platform will feature (i) heterogeneous systems composed of programmable base stations, mobile devices and static sensors; (ii) state of the art massive MIMO base-stations; (iii) ability to conduct research over a diverse spectrum range (from 50 MHz to 3.8 GHz), and (iv) a large-scale software defined wireless networking testbed integrated with an existing NSF-funded cloud testbed, thereby enabling end-to-end experimentation. Another unique aspect of the platform is support for wireless mobility-based studies, provided by using couriers with predictable movement patterns (e.g., buses), less predictable but bounded mobility (e.g., maintenance vehicles), and controllable couriers (e.g., on-site volunteers). Each of these deployed units will consist of  base  functionality that includes user-programmable software defined radios,  bring your own device  (BYOD) experiments, and will be connected via a sophisticated platform control framework. Existing fiber links will connect the wireless base stations to about half a dozen edge compute platforms. This will enable complex device provisioning and a set of tools for scientific workflow management, collaboration, and artifact sharing, with a goal towards promoting rigorous standards for reproducibility in this field.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1258,"The PI will build a research program to develop novel integrated circuits and antennas that can generate high-power pulses with frequencies up to one terahertz (THz), several hundred times higher than the frequency of today's cellular networks. By exploiting the advantages of THz radiation, the proposed research program can transform wireless communications, imaging, and spectroscopic systems. THz communications systems will offer greater bandwidth and will also track mobile receivers with better fault tolerance than competing technologies with similar range and bandwidth, such as free space optical communication. THz imaging systems can not only bolster homeland's security by accurate detection of hidden objects and explosives, but also can prevent tens of thousands of lives lost in car accidents every year by increasing the accuracy of collision avoidance automotive radars. THz spectroscopy systems can identify the species of gas molecules with high specificity and detect trace quantities of those molecules with high sensitivity. The PI's long-term educational goal is to inspire students at all levels to pursue careers in STEM disciplines. Working with the Rice University Office of STEM Engagement to provide research experience and internship opportunities for high-school teachers from Houston Independent School District, the PI will assist teachers with the development of their physics curriculum. The PI will work with the Rice Center for Excellence & Equity to engage underrepresented minority students in research and to provide summer internship opportunities for them. The objective of the proposed research program is to develop novel integrated circuits and antennas that can generate, radiate, detect, and steer coherent high-power pulses with frequencies up to 1THz. With today's silicon processes, it is possible to build a complex integrated circuit with on-chip antennas operating in frequencies up to 500GHz. However, most of the existing solutions are narrow-band and based on continuous-wave signal generation. To push the performance limits of high-speed wireless communications, three-dimensional radar imaging, and THz spectroscopy, broadband sources and detectors are required. The basic research carried out under this program is expected to advance the state-of-the-art in broadband time-domain signal generation and detection. The PI will demonstrate the intellectual merit of the proposed program through the following contributions: (1) demonstrating picosecond impulse radiating arrays, (2) demonstrating picosecond impulse sampling arrays, (3) developing accurate and reliable measurement systems to characterize picosecond sources and detectors, (4) producing high-resolution three-dimensional radar imagesThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria. automobile accident; Award; base; Basic Science; career; Communication; Complex; Detection; detector; Development; Dimensions; Educational Curriculum; Evaluation; experience; Foundations; Frequencies; Gases; Generations; Goals; High School Faculty; Image; imaging system; Internships; Measurement; Mission; Names; novel; optical communication; Performance; Physics; Physiologic pulse; prevent; Process; programs; Radar; Radiation; Research; Resolution; Rice; Sampling; school district; Security; Signal Transduction; Silicon; Source; Specificity; Spectrum Analysis; Speed; STEM field; Students; System; teacher; Technology; Time; underrepresented minority student; Universities; wireless communication; WorkCAREER: SILICON-BASED ELECTRONIC ARRAYS FOR COHERENT GENERATION AND DETECTION OF PICOSECOND PULSES",0.999999,1e-06,0.0002696549152014683,1e-06,1.5005380673306192e-06,1e-06,1e-06
1259,"This research responds to the need to make rice growing more sustainable. Globally rice is the staple food of over 3 billion people yet consumes significant water resources and contributes 10% of anthropogenic methane to the atmosphere. The PI has the long-term career goal to develop sustainable, climate-smart irrigation strategies for rice production while significantly contributing to the education of the next generation of scientists and agricultural professionals. The research objective is to quantify the climate impact of water-saving irrigation strategies, to test their potential scalability, and to encourage more wide-spread implementation of these practices. The irrigation practices to be studied create less frequent field inundation, thus they significantly reduce methane that would be produced under flooded conditions (33-98% reductions in methane emission). The research aims to integrate micrometeorological flux observations, rice harvest data, and irrigation practice information to optimize (1) the net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over a growing season and (2) rice yields, with net reduced costs. The education objective of this proposal is to advance the Environmental and Spatial Technology (EAST) initiative, which is a regionally important project-based, service learning program at middle and high schools. The PI will work with three EAST school programs to collect data useful to the research objectives and to generate a state map to model how changes in land cover can impact groundwater levels and greenhouse gas emissions. This program will help students engage with geospatial science, provide awareness of food and agriculture-related careers and higher education opportunities, and expand perceptions of the food-energy-water nexus.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1260,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARYThis award is a collaboration between the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation. It supports computational research and education that includes developing computer simulation tools and applying them to advance understanding of battery electrode material performance. Material failures are serious roadblocks to the development of high performance energy storage materials, which are vital to many applications, such as electric cars and delivering renewable energy. The PI aims to use computers to simulate the chemistry and mechanics of candidate electrode materials in a lithium-ion battery. The PI will investigate proposed high-performance electrode materials, particularly one made of copper coated silicon on a scaffold made of carbon. The simulations will show how charging and discharging cycles affect the failure of the electrode material. The research activities will not only advance the scientific knowledge on the material structure changes and the dynamics of lithium ions of silicon-based electrode composites, but also will provide a Mutliscale Modeling Toolbox that describes physics and chemistry that spans from processes on the scale of atoms to macroscopic scales. The computational toolbox can be extended to systems beyond silicon and lithium technology such as newly developed magnesium and lithium air batteries. This approach has impact on enhancing the performance of energy storage materials. This project also supports educational activities that will employ the latest methods of emerging media to recruit and retain underrepresented students and women to engineering through professional programs at Rice University, and provide outreach to local high school teachers in Houston to help enrich the science content and to introduce pedagogical methods with lesson plans to nurture future generations.TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis award is a collaboration between the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation. It supports computational research and education to develop a reactive molecular-dynamics-based multiscale simulation framework that enables the application of fundamental material science to tackle the pressing global needs for high performance energy storage materials. These needs include high capacity, rate, and cycle life rechargeable batteries. The overarching goal is to study how the intrinsic coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry during cycling impact the failure and performance of silicon-based electrode composites of lithium-ion batteries. Copper coated silicon deposited onto a 3D carbon scaffold will be a focus of this modeling effort. A novel computational protocol will be developed to enable understanding of the synergistic behavior of material characteristics and atomistic processes across multiple length scales and how it affects the performance of silicon-based electrodes. The proposed electrode composite will provide a 3D template, which exhibits improved service life and performance as well as lightweight and multifunctional features. The key hypotheses of this project are: 1) there exists two or more phase boundaries in the composite silicon electrodes that co-evolve, influence each other, and trigger defects and mismatched strains, and 2) a memory effect in the topology of the active material controls the system to retrace a similar electrochemical pathway during cycling, leading to voltage hysteresis. By sequentially monitoring relithiation and delithiation processes, the PI aims to unravel a series of complicated dynamic atomistic mechanisms at unprecedented length scales, including aggregation and segregation pathways of residual silicon topology, and formation of voltage hysteresis. The work is aimed to provide fundamental insights and to introducing new design concepts and principles for de novo computational-driven fabrication of lightweight and high performance rechargeable batteries, which may lead to a new line of research.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1261,"Like all species, grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley contain genes encoding information that determines the amino acid sequence of all the proteins that plant synthesizes to germinate, grow and reproduce. All genes in an organism use a simple, four-letter alphabet (A, C, G, T) to make three-letter words (codons) to specify each amino acid of a protein. There is redundancy in this genetic code with multiple, similar codons often coding for the same amino acid. In the DNA, the overall G+C content of genes within any given species is often very similar. However, in grass species there are high-GC and low-GC genes, and there is evidence that high-GC and low-GC genes may be transcribed from DNA into RNA and translated from RNA into protein differently. This project will test whether proteins from high-GC and low-GC genes are transcribed and translated with equal efficiency and, specifically, whether that differential regulation is used when responding to heat, cold and drought stress. This work will also discover rules about codon usage and protein synthesis that can be used to design transgenes for efficient protein production. Finally, current gene prediction software does not account for the high-GC and low-GC genes found in grasses. This project will create a new gene prediction program that will more accurately predict genes in grasses. Better gene prediction will benefit the larger community of plant researchers, including those who work with economically important grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley.Grass genes have a bimodal GC distribution and a significant 5' to 3' GC gradient. Little is known about the consequence of such variation on gene and protein expression. High gene GC content and strong negative 5' to 3' gradients in grasses strongly affect codon usage bias. It is possible that both GC biased gene conversion and codon usage bias are important in shaping the unusual GC features that are found in grass genes. GC biased gene conversion may help to move gene mutation towards a particular codon usage program, and then selection on that codon bias may maintain a gene's GC content and gradient. GC biased gene conversion in rice will be examined. Transcriptional and translational characteristics of native and transgenes that differ only in their GC content will also be studied in rice. Translational efficiency may also be affected by regulation of tRNAs in a tissue or condition-specific manner. Therefore, regulation of tRNAs will be examined to determine if changes in tRNA abundances affect protein translational efficiency. Recent published data indicate that due to the variation of GC content in grass genes, a notable number of genes in grasses have been missed or mis-annotated by existing gene finders. A new gene prediction tool that accounts for grass bimodal GC distribution will be designed to improve gene annotation in grasses. The results from this project will provide novel insights into gene evolution in grasses as well as important guidance for crop improvement via genetic modification.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1262,"The Condensed Matter and Materials Theory and Condensed Matter Physics Programs jointly contribute support to this award. This award provides resources for a workshop that brings together theorists and experimentalists to discuss a possible new kind of superconductivity that may have application in the development of quantum computers. The workshop will be held at Rice University on April 24-25, 2018. Whether a material conducts electricity or not provides a natural classification of materials into metals like copper and insulators like silicon. Within the past 20 years, it was realized that insulators can be bit more interesting. There are the classic insulators like silicon and rubber, but there are also topological insulators which have an insulating bulk and intrinsic metallic states that surround the surfaces and edges. Bismuth selenide, a compound made from the elements of bismuth and selenium, provides an example of a topological insulator. Since the discovery of topological insulators, new classes of topological materials have been proposed, among these are topological superconductors. Superconductors have no resistance to the flow of electricity. This reflects the collective quantum mechanical behavior of the electrons in the superconducting state. Topological superconductors have a superconducting bulk. While topological insulators have associated metallic surface states, topological superconductors have exotic surface states that behave differently than collections of ordinary particles like electrons and photons - the  particles  of light, but in a way that could form the basis of computation by manipulation of a quantum mechanical state. Topological materials are robust to noise and defects that would disrupt most quantum mechanical states and severely limit their use in quantum computers.Driven by potential applications to quantum computing, there is now an intense worldwide search for materials that exhibit the experimental signatures of topological superconductors. This two-day workshop will bring together scientists from around the world that use experiments to probe candidate materials, as well as those that develop the theory and phenomenology of topological superconductivity. An important distinguishing feature of this workshop will be a focus on bulk topological superconducting materials and two-dimensional surface states. The workshop will address an acute need to gather and focus theoretical and experimental leaders in this nascent field, which has received much less attention than other efforts to engineer quantum computers. Graduate and undergraduate students will be encouraged to attend the workshop to excite interest in the next generation. A report on opportunities in research on topological superconductivity will result from this activity. This workshop is aligned with the NSF's Quantum Leap Big Idea.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

In addition there will be a one day weekend workshop for graduate students and postdocs during the fall semester.Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations in many variables. Such systems are of central importance to mathematics and its applications, such as coding theory, cryptography, and the study of various natural phenomena. This grant will fund a conference series in this area in which investigators from Texas and the neighboring states will discuss the newest developments in the field with each other and with experts from outside the region. The conference series is also an important opportunity for regionally-based researchers, especially graduate students and postdocs, to meet, interact, gain exposure for their research, and establish new collaborations.

1264,"This REU site, Nanotechnology REU with a Focus on Community Colleges at Rice University aims to broaden the participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM by providing research opportunities to local community college students in the area of nanotechnology, a cutting edge and rapidly progressing field that cuts across many disciplines and addresses well-recognized, real-world problems. Nanotechnology integrates the physical sciences and engineering with applications in medicine, energy, and the environment that are particularly appealing to recruit and retain college students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Historically, economically disadvantaged and first generation students have an underrepresented presence in STEM. Community colleges serve a high percentage of underrepresented groups and present a rich pool of future scientists and engineers. Undergraduate research can help build confidence and research skills and in turn, play a pivotal role in a student's decision to pursue graduate school or research careers. This REU Site aspires to integrate local community college students with an enriching and meaningful laboratory experience in a community of scholars with mentorship and support that will facilitate their transition and retention into a four-year university. The objectives of this REU site are: 1) facilitate the development of engineering students from underrepresented groups and economically disadvantaged populations; 2) educate community college students about STEM research careers; 3) provide experiences in research laboratories while demonstrating the excitement of STEM careers; 4) build and maintain mentoring relationships with our participants; and 5) promote effective inter-institutional partnerships between Rice University and community colleges in the Texas Gulf Coast Region. The 10-week research experience will introduce students to research, applications, and education and career opportunities in nanotechnology in an inclusive culture. Students will interact with Rice faculty, post-doctoral and graduate student mentors and teaching staff who will be guiding them through program activities that include research methodology, oral and written presentations, networking, career webinars, and college transferring; along with local STEM industrial opportunities that will promote the dissemination of the program's impact into their communities. REU participants will present their research findings at the Smalley-Curl Nanotechnology Institute's Summer Research Colloquium. These program activities are designed to cultivate interest in STEM, provide skills and knowledge in conducting research and scientific thinking, and assimilate community college students in a university setting for a viable future in STEM.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1265,"For many, social media are valuable because they allow a wider variety of voices to be heard and more varied accounts of events to become part of the public record. For social scientists interested in how social media are affecting our society, these claims raise a number of important questions. How does the social media record differ from a traditional archive? How do the  selves  that people produce digitally compare to those they inhabit in ordinary interpersonal contexts? The research supported by this award, which trains an American graduate student in methods of conducting empirically-grounded scientific research, will address these questions. The research is important because we need to understand all aspects of how social media affect our society and our institutions. The research will be carried out by Rice University anthropology doctoral student, Baird Campbell, with the guidance of Dr. A. Cymene Howe. The researcher has chosen Santiago, Chile, as his research site. This is an appropriate site because Chile went through a marked political transition in the late 1990s. This created a unique boundary and clear contrast between past and present, and led to the rise numerous groups trying to re-write history and change their own public images through social media. The researcher will take advantage of this contrast and activism to compare traditional and official written accounts with contemporary digital archives. He also will conduct participant observation in activist groups; interview a stratified sample of group members, comparing their in-person narratives with their digital ones; conduct focus groups, stratified by age, to account for generation differences; and collect data thorough an on-line survey. Findings from this research will contribute to social science theories of the relationship between social media, social memory, and history. It will also help policy makers who must regularly evaluate the role of social media in the society at large.

1266,"The purpose of this study is to better understand what controls how fast crystals can grow in simple and complex natural systems. For example, crystal growth has direct implications for predicting the conditions for volcanic eruptions because crystallization may induce the formation of bubbles or increase the viscosity of magma, both of which facilitate the build-up of the over-pressures needed for eruptions. Quantifying crystal growth rates would also provide insight into how long it takes for magma bodies to grow before they erupt catastrophically, generating hazardous conditions for life and human society. Adequate methods for constraining crystal growth rate, however, remain elusive. The goal of this work is to develop and calibrate a new crystal growth speedometer based on the extent to which trace elements are incorporated into a rapidly growing crystal at levels that deviate from equilibrium. Theory will be combined with state of the art in situ analytical measurements to develop a generalized workflow for quantifying crystal growth rates. This work will have implications for 1) magma dynamics prior to eruption, 2) the rate at which faults and cracks heal after a natural or induced earthquake and 3) the rates at which economically important mineral deposits are precipitated in veins. The work also has implications for controlling the rate of latent heat release by crystallization from melts or solutions, which in turn, has implications for chemical storage of renewable energies (solar and wind). Participants of this project will also be involved in several community outreach programs in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Rice University: 1) content production for Outcroppings, a department sponsored magazine of the Earth, environment and energy, 2) geology education with K-12 teachers and students in Houston, and 3) participation and organizing of an annual industry-Rice Earth Science symposia that brings together leaders in industry and academia to work on problems of mutual societal interest.The goal of this project is to develop a relatively new crystal growth speedometer based on disequilibrium incorporation of trace elements that would otherwise be rejected by the crystal at equilibrium (incompatible elements). This speedometer will be developed by calibrating against field studies in which crystal growth rates have been independently constrained. A fundamental objective will be to evaluate how common disequilibrium effects associated with rapid crystal growth are observed in magmatic systems. A comprehensive sampling of olivines in magmas from different tectonic and volcanic settings will be analyzed for incompatible trace elements using state of the art high resolution laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The empirical speedometer will then be applied to olivine phenocryst populations from different magmatic settings to map out the distribution of crystal growth rates within the population, with particular emphasis on resolving the question of whether phenocrysts grow slowly in a long-lived magma chamber or instead nucleated and grew just before eruption. Insights from this work will be used to develop models for crystal growth in different geologic settings, such as during fault healing and generation of pegmatites.

1267,"The initiation of flowering is a key transition in the plant life cycle. In many plant species, particularly those adapted to temperate climates, flowering occurs at a particular time of year in response to the sensing of seasonal cues such as changes in day-length and temperature. The objective of the research is to further the understanding of the genes and biochemical pathways that control the timing of flowering in response to seasonal cues in grasses, a group of plants that includes many important crops such as wheat, oats, rice, and corn. Much of the research will utilize the model grass Brachypodium distachyon because working in this species facilitates identifying the genes underlying flowering in response to seasonal cues. The data generated will help to lay the groundwork for tailoring the flowering of crop species, and will advance the basic understanding of how organisms have evolved systems to perceive environmental cues and translate those cues into developmental programs such as the initiation of flowering. This project will result in the training of graduate students and postdocs, and provide undergraduates with an opportunity to learn about research in genetics, molecular biology, and plant development while exploring their interests in a STEM career. The project will also involve development of a classroom module to provide K-12 students with an opportunity to explore how plants grow and develop and respond to seasonal signals such as the cold of winter.A major goal is to advance the understanding of how perception of winter cold as well as the short days of winter are translated into stable, epigenetic changes in gene expression that enable grasses that are adapted to temperate climates to become competent to flower in the spring when conditions are most favorable for reproduction. The process is known as vernalization. The project will involve studying certain recently discovered key genes involved in both cold-mediated and short-day-mediated flowering in grasses. These genes had not previously been known to play a role in flowering. One group of genes encodes proteins that may be part of a novel, plant-specific gene regulatory complex; another represents a new role for a member of the florigen gene family. A combination of genetics and biochemistry will be employed to explore the role of the proteins encoded by these genes with the goal of better understanding the molecular basis of how flowering is regulated in response to seasonal cues in grasses. The flowering pathways under study evolved independently in different groups of plants; thus, this research is also a model for studying how convergent evolutionary pathways can lead to a solution to the common problem of ensuring that flowering only occurs after winter has ended.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

1268,"Addressing the food needs of an increasing global population in the 21st century will require significant improvements in agriculture akin to the Green Revolution of the previous century. To address this goal it is of critical importance to understand as much as possible about the functions of the tens of thousands of genes present in each plant species, in order to select those functions of most relevance to engineering favorable traits such as drought tolerance or increased grain quality. Much of what is currently known about plant gene function comes from experiments in model plant systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana, but because of evolutionary relatedness this information can be used to predict the functions of genes in crop species such as maize and rice, and to provide targeted hypotheses that can be followed up by further experiments. This project will increase both the efficiency and accuracy of gene function prediction in plants by organizing and integrating high quality data from a number of sources and presenting it in a user-friendly format that makes clear the evolutionary relationships between genes. The team will develop software for visualizing the evolutionary relationships as a gene family tree, providing an organizing framework for disparate experimental observations from a number of experimental systems. The project will provide software for use, and for data sharing, by a broad community of both researchers and students. The project?s inclusion of local community college students will provide training and increase participation in computer science, genomics and plant biology by groups that are underrepresented in these fields.The project output will be a powerful and intuitive software tool for inferring plant gene function from phylogenetic relationships and experimental evidence. To achieve this goal the project aims are to: 1) assemble sets of phylogenetic trees using selected model organism and plant genomes, along with a suite of web services to ensure easy access to the data; 2) follow user-driven design principles to design and build the user interface, in order to visualize the phylogenetic trees and associate the genes within each tree with high quality functional information including Gene Ontology annotations, gene expression patterns, protein domains, sequence variations and mutant phenotypes; 3) provide an analysis platform that streamlines workflows and includes personal workspaces for users to add their own data and make it public when their work is completed, thus enriching the knowledgebase; and 4) produce workshops, course materials and online content to train scientists at all academic levels on how to use the software.

1269,"In multicellular organisms, some cells specialize in secretory functions. Examples of secretory cells include certain vascular cells that secrete nutrients for distribution, epidermal cells that export protective compounds, nectaries that secrete solutes to reward pollinators, tapetal cells that nourish reproductive cells, and seed coat cells that secrete nutrients to fill seeds. Pathogens apparently tap into nutrient resources by manipulating nutrient secretion systems. Despite the importance of secretory cells, the understanding of these cells and biological processes is limited. This project seeks to identify the fundamental mechanisms of secretory cells, to permit the enhancement of crop quality and yield, of the interaction of plants with other organisms, and of stress tolerance. The project team combines expertise in the genome-wide analysis of individual cell types (Bailey-Serres, & Girke, UC Riverside), membrane transport processes (Frommer, Carnegie, Stanford) and genome editing (Yang, Iowa State U). The project is expected to provide new tools and information of value for agriculture. Concepts and resources developed by the project will be integrated into classes at 2-year institutions with substantial enrollments of underserved students. A public website, blog and forum will provide discussion of genome editing technologies, with the participation of experts and local community colleges.The SECRETome project seeks to identify specific components and regulatory mechanisms of the varied functions of plant secretory cells. To enable an evaluation of gene function within individual cells and tissues, imaging, ribosome-mRNA complex capture, gene editing and informatics will be employed in an integrated fashion. A comparative approach will be enabled through the analysis of both the crop rice and the reference plant Arabidopsis. Specific aims include (1) the profiling of ribosome-associated transcripts (translatomes) of key secretory cell types with prominent roles in secretion or nursing of neighboring cells in the two species, in the context of two developmental processes and two biotic interactions, (2) the identification of characteristic gene expression patterns and networks for specific secretory cell-types to facilitate selection of candidate genes for functional studies, and (3) the validation and characterization of secretory cell-specific promoters and candidate gene functions, including subcellular location, biochemistry, and reverse-genetic phenotype. The secretory cell-specific promoters will be valuable for other studies (e.g., to control genes for cell-specific processes that enhance pathogen defense, beneficial microbial interactions, fertility or seed quality). The results will provide broad new insights into the intersection between cell function, development and biotic interactions. The project will produce public resources and discourse forums regarding genomic editing with the engagement of undergraduate students.

1270,"As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This RAPID project was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter (NSF 17-128) related to Hurricane Harvey along the Gulf Coast. The PBS NewsHour team will produce 9 stories for national distribution using multiple broadcast and online channels that will engage the public and increase their understanding of the science and engineering research being conducted to better predict and mitigate the impact of future storms. Hurricane Harvey was the first of several storms in 2017 that hit first Texas then Florida and the Caribbean creating unprecedented devastation. This project aims to help the public better understand the science behind storms, and how scientists and engineers are actively collecting data, developing new models, using new technologies, and studying the environmental recovery. The PBS NewsHour team has in place experienced science journalists, production facilities, and a distribution network that can quickly develop media stories based on the work of scientists and engineers in the field, many of whom are funded by NSF. The NewsHour has a strong track record of telling stories that are scientifically accurate yet highly engaging and understandable to a diverse audience. Researchers from several universities including Texas A&M, Rice University, and Norfolk State University are advising the NewsHour team and may also be featured in some of the media. The team will also use their existing collaboration with education researchers at New Knowledge, Inc. to seek audience feedback on proposed/produced media.The potential audience reach of these stories is extensive. Stories that are broadcast on the nightly PBS NewsHour reach 1.6 million people. The NewsHour's website currently reaches 6 million while their YouTube channel has 40 million views. They have a growing audience of younger viewers who mainly get their news on social media channels such as ScienceScope and Apple News. EXTRA is another service offered just for teachers.

In addition,pediatric medical devices also need to accommodate the unique pathophysiology and anatomy of pediatricpatients. The Southwest Pediatric Device Consortium based at Texas Children’s Hospital and Baylor College ofMedicine supports pediatric device innovators with product and technology acceleration services and businessacceleration services both regionally and nationally, with the goal of commercialization and clinical use of novelpediatric medical devices. The consortium includes clinical, scientific, business, financial, regulatory,reimbursement, engineering, ISO13485 compliant product design & manufacturing, intellectual property, andacademic partners in the Houston / Southwest U.S. region, including Texas A&M University, Rice University,University of Houston, local device development firms, and other children’s hospitals in the Southwest U.S.region. The consortium facilitates the development of pediatric medical devices by coordinating resources withinits existing translational and commercialization framework. The consortium recognizes that pediatric deviceprojects may need an extended life cycle in the children’s hospital / academic setting before exposure to theexternal market, where the faculty, students, and resources of major children's hospitals can partner withestablished engineering design teams at major research universities to identify unmet pediatric device needs,assemble clinical faculty and engineering design team partnerships, and then develop and test new pediatricdevice prototypes that can be developed into viable pediatric medical devices. The consortium will also help toincrease awareness around the need for novel pediatric medical device development, as well as identify andaddress current barriers to the development and commercialization of pediatric devices with a particular focuson establishing a productive needs-driven pipeline of new pediatric medical devices. The consortium networksits stakeholders with the business, investment, higher education, and philanthropic communities in the entireSouthwest U.S. region in order to provide pediatric innovators with comprehensive pediatric device developmentservices.
